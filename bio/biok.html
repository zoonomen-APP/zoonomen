Keve-Kleiner			1909-1984

	Keve-Kleiner,Andr&aacute;s

	b. 10 Nov. 1909 Budapest.
	d. 30 Mar. 1984

Jiri Mlikovsy provides additional useful details (<i>in litt.</i> 2008.05.08)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are a few comments on Keve/Kleiner. The man was a significant Hungarian ornithologist 
(living in 1909-1984).  I do not know how exactly he was baptized, but he started to publish 
as "Kleiner", continuing as "Keve-Kleiner" and later as "Keve". 
	I was told by Ernst Bauernfeind (from the Wien Museum) that he changed his name 
for security reasons.  "Kleiner" means "small, little" in German and it was dangerous 
to have a German name in the post-war Hungary.  "Keve" means nothing in Hungarian, 
but "kevesebb" means "less, short", "kevesen" means "few in number", etc. 
So I think "Keve" is an allusion of "Kleiner", though not an exact translation.


A bibliography of Hungarian ornithology (Budapest 1980) shows that Keve/Kleiner 
published under the following names:

Kleiner, Endre - in 1930-1942 (102 papers in all)

Keve-Kleiner, Andr&aacute;s - in 1943-1944 (17 papers are dated 1943, two papers are dated 1944)

Keve, Andr&aacute;s - in 1946-1979 (and perhaps later, but that period was not covered by the Bibliography).

The first name "Endre" is Hungarian, being equivalent to "Andr&aacute;s" (Hungarian), 
"Andreas" (in German) or "Andrew" (English). The reasons why Keve/Kleiner changed 
also his first name from one to another Hungarian version are unknown to me, 
but there was probably some period connotation of "Endre". 

Keve/Kleiner used to translate his first name according to the language in which he wrote a paper, 
but only "Endre" and "Andr&aacute;s" were official.

An obituary of Keve/Kleiner was published here:

J&aacute;nossy, D. (1985) Dr. Keve Andr&aacute;s (1909-1984). - Aquila 92: 13-17. 
(I do not have this volume at hand, so I could not consult the paper. 
BTW: Its is written in Hungarian)


Note please that surname is written first in Hungarian, so "Keve Andr&aacute;s" 
is used in Hungarian, while "Andr&aacute;s Keve" is used in most other languages.

Koelz, Walter Norman				1895-1989

	Born: Sept. 11, 1895 Waterloo, Michigan.
	Died: Sept. 24, 1989 Waterloo, Michigan.
	Biography from Univ.Mich.</pre>
	Walter Norman Koelz was born in Waterloo, Michigan on September 11, 1895. 
	He received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Michigan in 1920. 
	His area of specialization was zoology, not the background one would expect for a collector 
	of oriental art, but it was his background in biology which first took him to Asia. 
	Dr. Koelz had already done some exploring with the 1925 McMillan Expedition 
	to the American arctic, as well as comprehensive studies on whitefishes while 
	working for The University of Michigan, the United States Bureau if Fisheries, 
	and the state-supported Institute for Fisheries Research, when he was offered 
	a post with the Himalayan Research Institute of the Roerich Museum. 
	He accepted and arrived in Naggar, Kulu, in May 1930, to begin botanical explorations. 
	Dr. Koelz left the Roerich post and returned to Michigan in 1932, but he had 
	developed a strong interest in Tibetan culture which led to his appointment 
	as Research Fellow on the Charles L. Freer Fund in September of 1932. 
	During the summer of 1933 he returned to Indian Tibet to collect material for 
	the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology. 
	In 1936 Dr. Koelz travelled once more to India, this time as a plant explorer 
	for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 1939 he began a seven year exploration 
	through Persia, followed by more trips to India, Nepal and Assam. 
	His Persian Diary, 1939-1941 has been published by The Museum of Anthropology. 
	In 1956 Dr. Koelz was awarded the Meyer Memorial Award for outstanding contributions 
	to the world of Agriculture. His seed collections are credited with saving several 
	agricultural species in this country. Dr. Kolez held an appointment with the 
	University of Michigan for 74 years. After many years spent all over the world 
	he returned to live in the house in which he was born. He died there on September 24, 1989.
	<pre>

	On his travels Koelz is reported to have worn native dress. His travels visited many areas currently (2015)
	deeply troubled and torn with strife and war.  These areas are unlikely to be visited soon by biological
	collectors.

	During his time at the Am.Mus.Nat.Hist. in the late 40's and early 50's he published taxa from
	his travel collections. For reasons unknown there was something of a "falling-out" with Dr Vaurie.
	The Richmond Index has many of his taxa giving his name in quotes (as "Koelz") and in some instances
	given as '"Koelz" [=Mayr]'. There is no indication in these works of Mayr's role (if any) in these 
	names, or their publication.  They do not represent "Mayr in Koelz".

	b. 5 Sept. 1903, Leipzig
	d. 11 Aug. 1995 ("11. 8. 1995")

	sometimes spelled Kumerlowe, Kummerlowe, Kumerl&ouml;we or Kumerloeve.
	</pre>
	Kees Roselaar provides an interesting explanation for the spelling variations (email 2004.04.05:
	<pre>
	The reason for unclearity is pretty clear: Kummerl&ouml;we (with two 'mm's and
	an Umlaut) changed his name to Kumerloeve somewhere during the II World
	War. Hence, all his earlier publications have a different spelling of the
	many later ones. In this case, I think you should keep to the original
	spelling of the article, in contrast to Dementiev-Dementieff-Dement'ev-Dementiew. 
	Happily, there are not many pre-1940 articles of Kummerl&ouml;we 
	(he wrote his first articles as a student of Stresemannn in about 1934-5), 
	because he soon became deeply involved in Hitler's SS. This was likely 
	also the reason to change his name, as Kummerl&ouml;we means "underdeveloped lion", 
	what's not a good name for a high SS-officer. The name Kumerloeve is 
	meaningless in German. He [was] ... in jail quite a period after the 1945's, 
	but was a highly prolific writer and nature conservationist thereafter, 
	devoting much of his time to the Middle East.
