Isert, Paul Erdmann 				1756-1789	W Indies +  Africa 


		1756: born Brandenburg  
		Appointed Chief Surgeon to the Danish settlements in West Africa when in his late twenties. 
		Arrived on the Gold Coast in November, 1783. 
		He left in October 1786, apparently angered by being refused permission to travel inland 
		at the invitation of the Asante king, Osei Kwame, one of whose sisters had availed herself 
		of his medical skills. 
		Returned in November 1788, with his bride of seven months. 
		Paul died on 21 January 1789, and his wife on 25 February. 
		Their daughter, born on 17 February, survived her mother by only three weeks. 

		Remembered principally for his book, <i>Reise nach Guinea und den Carib&auml;ischen Inseln in Columbia</i>, 
		published in Copenhagen in 1788. Cast in the form of twelve letters, 
		written between 10 November 1783 and 10 July 1787. 
		The first six dealing with affairs in the area of the Volta estuary, and including 
		an account of the Danish sponsored attack on the Anlo 
		The seventh letter reports Isert's visit to Whydah; 
		the eighth is concerned principally with the Ga in whose territory the Danes 
		had their headquarters, Christiansborg; 
		the ninth describes the circumstances of the European transients on the Gold Coast; 
		and the tenth has an account of Akuapem, which the author visited, 
		together with brief notes on the Akwamu, Krobo, Fante, Akyem and Asante. 
		The eleventh and twelfth letters relate Isert's experiences on board the slaver 
		that took him to the Caribbean, en route for Denmark in late 1786, 
		and offers observations on the islands of St. Croix, St. Eustacius, 
		St. Thomas, St. John, Guadeloupe and Martinique. 

		<i>Reise nach Guinea</i> was first translated into Danish in 1789, 
		Dutch in 1790 and French in 1793. 
		An English version has now been produced by Selena Axelrod Winsnes. 
		Isert wrote in appallingly bad German, despite this being his mother tongue.
