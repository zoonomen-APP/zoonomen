Biographical data from Denver Library Ned Dearborn Papers:
"BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

Ned Dearborn is known mostly for his work with the U.S. Biological Survey and his writings about birds of
Eastern America. A native of New Hampshire, his writing focused on the ornithological occupants of his
home region.

Dearborn was born in Alton, New Hampshire on November 24, 1865. He attended Dartmouth University, where
he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1891. Later he attended the New Hampshire State College and
earned a Masters' Degree in Science in 1898.

Following college, Dearborn taught public school for two years, supervised the lens department of Lord
Brothers Optical Company, taught at New Hampshire college for four years, and served as the assistant
curator of birds at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago from 1901-1909. His tenure with the
Biological Survey lasted from 1909 to 1920, when he became the manager of the Dearborn Fur Farm in Sacket
Harbor, New York. [APP presumably Sackets Harbor, NY]

Dearborn was the author of several works on birds of the Northeast, including Birds of Belknap and
Merrimac Counties, N.H. (1898), Birds of Durham and Vicinity, N.H. (1902), Trapping on the Farm (1920),
and co-author of Birds in Their Relation to Man (1903). He continued to work on his fur farm until his
death in 1948.

Information obtained from "Ned Dearborn" in Who Was Who in American History, Vol. 4, 1961-1968, Chicago,
1968."

 Dillwyn, Lewis Llewelyn 			1814-1892
	Born: 14 May 1814
	Member of Parliament.
	Died: 19 June 1892 (still an MP at time of death).
	
	(middle name often spelled "Llewellyn")

	Richard Morris, whose wife is a descendant of Dillwyn's writes
	(2002.01.11):
	"Lewis Llewelyn (correct spelling!) Dillwyn was a British Member
	of Parliament and an industrialist. His father, Lewis Weston
	Dillwyn FRS,FLS was the famous botanist and wrote a number of
	books on the subject.

	LLD did belong to the Linnean Society but as far as I am
	aware never wrote or published on botany.

	The elder brother of LLD was John Dillwyn Llewelyn, a pioneer
	photographer who married a cousin of Henry Fox Talbot.

	The family emigrated to America about 1682 and a grandson
	returned [in the] end of 18th c and settled in London. The
	township of Dillwyn, Virginia, is I believe, named after the
	family and the Parrish Museum on Long Island
	created by a descendant."

 Dillwyn, Lewis Weston
		Born: 1778
		Died: Aug. 31, 1855 at Swansea, Wales.
