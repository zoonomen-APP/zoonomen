HISTORICAL NOTE
Melbourne Armstrong Carriker, Jr. (1879-1965), was born in Sullivan, Illinois. 
By the time he graduated from high school, he was collecting bird skins and
studying the habits of birds extensively. His interest in bird lice (Mallophaga)
began during his freshman year at the University of Nebraska under the guidance
of Lawrence Bruner, and Carriker became one of the world's authorities on the
neotropical genera. During his career Carriker was responsible for the
description of two new families, four new subfamilies, fifty-three new genera and
subgenera, and eight hundred sixty-six new species and subspecies. Carriker was
prolific in his writing as well. Between 1940 and 1959 he produced thirty-three
papers, most of them large ones. His papers were published in Spanish as well as
English, and he corresponded with Mallophaga systematists all over the world.

Carriker collected specimens for some of the most important institutions in the
country, including the Carnegie Museum (1902 and 1907-1927); the American Museum
of Natural History (1909); the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia
(1929-1938); the United States National Museum (1940-1952); the Peabody Museum;
the Field Museum of Natural History; and the Los Angeles County Museum. He
traveled South America extensively on his collecting trips, covering Costa Rica,
Trinidad, Venezuela, and Curacao Island, and canvassing Peru, Bolivia, and
Colombia almost entirely. From 1907 to 1909, Carriker held the position of
assistant curator of birds at the Carnegie Museum. In 1953, he received the
honorary post of collaborator in the Department of Entomology, United States
National Museum, and he continued his collecting work until the month before his
death in 1965.
