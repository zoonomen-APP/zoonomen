<hr><A id="Wilkes"> 
Wilkes, John						17??-1829? 

	The catalogue file at the British Museum (Natural History)
	suggests Wilkes' vital dates are 17?? to 1811.
	I think that is unlikely as a death date. As this would imply
	his description (in a work published in weekly installments)
	was published 5 years posthumously.
	However, my source that suggested a death date of 1829 for
	Wilkes suggested a birthdate of 1796, the year the Encycl.Londinensis
	began publication, so probably his biographical dates
	should simply be regarded as uncertain.

137,138 CRITICAL NOTICES OF NEW PUBLICATIONS. 

"The Ornithological Guide ; in which are discussed several interest- 
ing points in Ornithology. By Charles Thorold Wood, jun., Esq. 
London : Whittaker &amp;Co. fcap. 8vo. 1836. 

In this book-making age octavo volumes are the work of a few 
short weeks, and the majority of the publications of the present day 
would certainly tend to prove the truth of our assertion. On tak- 
ing up the guide before us, we expected judging from the date of 
the preface, September, 1835 we had at length met with a book 
on which unusual care and labour had been bestowed. We must, 
however, say that we were disappointed. The volume is divided 
into three sections. The first of these is on the subject of nomen- 
clature, scientific and vernacular. We should have been better 
pleased had our author omitted the somewhat harsh critique on the 
letter of Mr. Strickland to this Journal, especially as it had already 
been replied to. A chapter on nomenclature might have been in- 
troduced without implicating Mr. Strickland so deeply in the mat- 
ter : even supposing Mr. S. to be in the wrong (which we are in- 
clined to believe), surely it is not necessary to resort to abuse to 
establish this fact. We rejoice, however, to see the reform of Eng- 
lish names advocated, and hope the example may be followed by- 
others. The second section consists of notices of ornithological 
works. In Mr. Neville Wood's Ornithologist's Text Book, one 
hundred and fifty works are included, in the present Guide only 
fifty, or exactly one-third ; we leave our readers to form their own 
conclusion. Lastly, we have a list of British birds for labelling 
cabinets. It is well worth the cost of the book ; it is the best cata- 
logue extant, and would have deserved our unqualified commenda- 
tion, had it not been for the unfortunate spelling of many of the 
names. We cannot compliment Mr. C. T. Wood on his style it is 
often pedantic, and not always even correct ; but still, with all its 
imperfections, the first chapter contains hints well worthy attention, 
and the catalogue will prove useful to the collector.
