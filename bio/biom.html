	There is some uncertainty about this authors name. Given by some authors as
	Maingounat, and by others as Maingonnat.
	[Paul Davis investigated this matter and determined that the majority of
	contemporary sources spelled the name "Maingonnat" and most probably this was 
	Anatole Maingonnat.]
	
	It is spelled Maingounat in the Peters Checklist II:132, following Delacourt's
	note in Ibis 1929 p.203.  Peters (and Delacour's) error has been followed by many authors.

Masters, George		1837-1912

	The Australian Dictionary of Biography (http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050253b.htm)
	gives the following biography.


MASTERS, GEORGE (1837-1912), entomologist, was born in July 1837 in
Maidstone, Kent, England, son of George Masters, gardener, and his wife
Matilda, n&eacute;e Terry. He became a gardener and about 1856 migrated to
Melbourne. Interested in natural history, he was employed by Dr Godfrey
Howitt for some two years. He collected insects in Tasmania and sold them
to W. J. Macleay. By 1860 he was a gardener at Shepherd's Darling Nursery
in Sydney. Recommended by Gerard Krefft, Masters was sent by Macleay to
Queensland to collect insects for him. In 1863-66 he exhibited thousands of
insects before the new Entomological Society of New South Wales.

On 2 June 1864 Masters was appointed assistant curator and collector to the
Australian Museum at a salary of &pound;200, on condition that he sold his
private collection and made no new one, an agreement he ignored. In the
1860s he travelled extensively in Queensland, New South Wales, South
Australia, Lord Howe Island, Tasmania and Western Australia and in 1870 in
the Snowy Mountains area and Queensland. He was a splendid shot, caught
venomous snakes with his bare hands and was fearless in the bush and with
Aboriginals. Masters made large collections which included a series of the
newly-found Queensland lungfish, 'the preserved skin of a black gin', such
rarities as the western bristle-bird and the noisy scrub bird, venomous
snakes for Krefft and many thousand insects and invertebrates. At one stage
he had collected more than half the natural history specimens in the
museum. He also continued to collect for William Macleay and increased his
own collection. In 1874 Masters testified against Krefft before the
Legislative Assembly select committee inquiring into the Australian Museum.
However, his evidence was inconsistent and he was embarrassed by questions
about the woman whom he had taken on his Western Australian trip and
represented as his wife.

Lured by a salary rise of &pound;100 Masters became curator of the Macleay
museum in January 1874. He travelled widely in New South Wales, beachcombed
round Port Jackson and in the Pea Hen dredged up and down the coast for
specimens. In 1875 he went on Macleay's Chevert expedition to New Guinea,
where he found the first-known egg of the bird of paradise. In 1871-74 he
published his Catalogue of described Coleoptera of Australia in parts and
they were continued in 1885-87 in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of
New South Wales where he often exhibited his specimens. When the Macleay
museum was transferred to the University of Sydney, Masters remained its
curator until 1912. His unrivalled knowledge of the habits and life
histories of Australian animals largely went unrecorded as he disliked
writing.

Full-bearded and energetic, Masters had strong likes and dislikes. With age
he suffered ill health and failing sight. After an accident in a cab on his
way to Government House he died at Elizabeth Bay on 23 June 1912 and was
buried in the Anglican section of Waverley cemetery. Predeceased by his
first wife Matilda Elizabeth, n&eacute;e Hodges, on 20 May 1903 and their
only child, he was survived by his second wife, a widow, Mary Jane Howard,
n&eacute;e Franklin. Although reputed to own much property, he left an
estate sworn for probate at &pound;3300.

	Much has been written about this unusual, charming, and it appears fundamentally
	dishonest man. I find T.E. Lawrence's characterization of interest.<pre>
	"... a student of bird migration drifted into soldiering ... 
	Meinertzhagen knew no half measures. He was logical, an idealist of
	the deepest, and so possessed by his convictions that he was willing
	to harness evil to the chariot of good. He was a strategist, a
	geographer, and a silent laughing masterful man; who took as blithe 
	a pleasure in deceiving his enemy (or his friend) by some
	unscrupulous jest, as in spattering the brains of a cornered mob of
	Germans one by one with his African knob-kerri. His instincts
	were abetted by an immensely powerful body and a savage brain, 
	which chose the best way to its purpose, unhampered by doubt or
	habit."</pre>

Motley, James 					1814-1859
	&amp; Dillwyn, Lewis Llewelyn

	Biographical notes from Mrs. FE Warr (via Richard Morris)
	"J.Motley was a civil engineer who went to Labuan in 1849 to work
	for the Eastern Archipelago Co. which mined the coal deposits on 
	the island (one of four campanies that went bankrupt in quick succession). 

	His work in collaboration with L.L.Dillwyn on the natural history 
	of Labuan (1855) is the first to contain field notes on the
	commoner birds of Borneo; meanwhile in 1854 he was appointed
	Superintendent of a private company in the territory of the
	Sultan of Banjarmasin, but was killed at Bangkal near there
	during the Malay insurrection of 1860 (see Nineteenth Century
	Borneo by Prof.Irwin). His bird collections and field notes
	survived and were the basis of Sclater's paper (1863). Motley
	added another 58 species to the Borneo list.
		(B.E.Smythies, The Birds of Borneo, 4th ed.,1999)


	"My friend Mr L.L.Dillwyn having placed in my hands some MS.
	notes written by the late Mr James Mottley of Banjermassing (who
	was killed in the Malay insurrection at that place in 1860),
	together with the series of bird-skins to which the notes refer,
	I have .......determined the species, and added some few remarks
	...."
		(P.L.Sclater, Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, 1863)


		Motley was a mining engineer who died in 1859.  
		He was in Labuan in 1852 and in Borneo from 1854 to 1859. (no
		ref.)"

	Note that Motley's dates are often given as 1814-1892 (e.g.
	Cat.LibraryBritishMuseum(N.H.)). Those <b>Dillwyn's</b> dates.

M&uuml;ller, Philipp Ludwig Statius

	b. 25 April 1725 Esens, East Frisia.
	d. 5 January 1776 Erlangen.


	Often as "Statius M&uuml;ller".

	After a long tradition of using "M&uuml;ller,PLS" to refer to this
	author, a recent trend has employed the more cumbrous "Statius M&uuml;ller"
	in recognition of his double surname without hyphen.
	igowever, Kraig Adler's excellent treatment of Muller ("Contributions to the History
	of Herpetology". 2012 <b>3</b>:39,40.) indicates that "he generally used only
	M&uuml;ller as his surname as is indicated here by his signature."
	The graphic reproduction of his signature shows:
	
	"P. L. St. M&uuml;ller."
	<a href="./image/IMG-0516.jpg" target="new">Muller,PLS signature</a>
(reproduced with permission from K. Adler)

	Also as Statius Muller

	The styling as Mueller is presumably in the belief that Muller was
	German and the use of "ue" for "&uuml;" is appropriate. He was not
	German, but Dutch. It does not cheer the Dutch to be mistaken for
	Germans.

	Variable narratives, each enthusiastically backed as "authentic" are
	used to support different versions of his last name, and it is even
	possible that one of these narratives may in fact be correct. 
	But which ONE?

	Of some possible use is the understanding that Peters Checklist
	(not necessarily to be considered an authority in such matters) uses
	"P. L. S. Muller" - usually with the umlaut 22 time. "Statius Muller"
	is never used in any form that I can find.
	Sherborn in Index Animalium <b>never</b> uses the "Statius Muller" form
	in anyway I can find, but uses the "P. L. S. Muller" form 326 times.
	Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. uses only P. L. S. Muller.
	Cat.BirdsAm. uses only P. L. S. Muller.
