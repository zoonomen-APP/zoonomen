	By John Kirk Townsend, Introduction and annotation by George A. Jobanek, 1999.
	Northwest Reprints Series.
	ISBN 0-87071-525-9. Paperback, $17.95.
	This classic account of western exploration and scientific discovery chronicles the journey of the first trained naturalist
	to cross the American continent.

	Nuttall took Townsend's collection of birds assembled at that time with him when he departed Oregon. The specimens arrived
	at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia in June, 1836, and Nuttall arrived in Boston three months later. Audubon
	anxiously sought access to both the collection and the naturalist. At work on his monumental Birds of America and wanting to
	illustrate the western species, Audubon greatly desired to talk with Nuttall about his discoveries in the west and to see
	Townsend's specimens. Townsend's supporters in Philadelphia, however, felt that Townsend should be enabled to publish the
	results of his own field work. It was finally agreed that Audubon might purchase duplicates of Townsend's specimens and that
	he and Nuttall would prepare a paper, under Townsend's name, publishing the new species. Thus a year before John Townsend
	returned from his long sojourn, Samuel Morton read his paper at an Academy of Natural Sciences meeting.46 -->

	Email note (2008.02.13) announcing his death (2008.02.11):</pre>

Mel Traylor, curator emeritus at the Field Museum, died at home over the
weekend, at the age of 92. Mel may be best known for his collaboration with
the late Raymond Paynter on the series of gazetteers for South American
countries, works that now form an important backbone for many of our
distributional and taxonomic studies, and for which Traylor and Paynter
were awarded the Elliot Coues Award by the American Ornithologists' Union
in 2001. But Mel published extensively over his career, not only on birds
of the neotropics but also on birds of Africa (including authoring a major
monograph on the birds of Angola), of China, of Nepal, and of many other
parts of the world. He hated to see a worthwhile project that was left
incomplete, and he was not afraid of tough challenges; it was no surprise
that Mel was chosen to revise the tyrannid chapter for the Peters checklist
series, a task that he completed successfully and that led to many
productive side papers on tyrant flycatcher taxonomy. Mel described a
number of bird taxa, including at least one species (Cisticola restricta,
of Africa); and at least one species, Tolmomyias traylori, was named in his
honor. Mel was a careful worker in the museum, with a keen eye for detail,
but also was cautious in interpreting his results. The collections at the
Field Museum contain several specimens that Mel recognized "didn't fit,"
but in the absence of additional material, he refrained from describing
them; his instincts were borne about when the specimens that Mel "flagged"
later were described by others as new species, including at least two
specimens of "his" Tolmomyias (!).<p>

As a Marine Corp officer, Mel was severely injured during the battle of
Tarawa in the Pacific theatre during World War II, where he lost one eye
and suffered arm and upper body wounds during the famous beach assault. He
returned to Chicago and resumed his volunteer participation in the affairs
of the Field Museum's bird division, where he later became employed as a
curator along with Austin Rand and Emmet (Bob) Blake. During the last few
years of his employment he served as Chairman of the Zoology Department,
and was as gracious and helpful an administrator as he always was a
colleague and friend.<p>

Mel continued to visit the Field Museum for many years after he retired,
until this was no longer practical. He always was interested in the work of
his younger colleagues, and did his best to keep up with advances in the
field. His deep curiosity about the world around him, his good humor, and
his gentle spirit were a source of pleasure and inspiration to all who knew
him.<pre>
