<hr><A name="Xantus"></a>
X&aacute;ntus				1825-1894
Xantus, Janos
Sometimes as:`
Xantus de Vesey, John
Xantus, Louis

	Terry Chesser indicates (in litt 2018.09.10) that Madden's biography 
	states that:
	"Xantus may have been justified in changing his name to Louis Vesey, 
	but his name in Hungary was never ‘John Xantus de Vesey’; 
	in later life he called himself ‘csiktaplocai Xantus Janos’ – 
	that is John Xantus of Csiktaploca – as a prerogative of noble origin, 
	but ‘Louis Vesey’ was a free invention.”
