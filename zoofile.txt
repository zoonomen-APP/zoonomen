2021.11.24. INITIAL start -- vers. 0.01.

INTRODUCTION.

NOTE: am currently writing this in fits and starts and MOSTLY for myself
trying to have a description of what I do and how and sometimes why I do it.

I am NOT particularly computer savvy, and have figured out almost all of this
on my own. I am a spectacularly incompetent programmer.
I use mostly UNIX/LINUX tools, and many ppl laugh at me for this.
Laughter is great, and boy do I laugh at those who laugh at me.
The tools are fast, free, universally available, and essential if you
are to operate at any level of computer sophistication. The tools work
really well and did long before Microsoft existed.  They will be working
well when no one remembers the name Microsoft.

Whats needed, and whats recommended.

Needed:
	The ability (now becoming rare) to interact primarily with your
	computer.
	You need to have a basic understandinrgt of how to create, find, and
	use directories and subdirectories.  If this is a problem for you
	please don't waste your time here, go back to your applications. 

Recommended:
	Ability to use a simple text editor. Using "Word" will be frustrating
	slow, and a waste of your time.
	I use vi (and vim) Notepad will work (but not all that well).
	Atom is good. there are many free ones.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Files, directories, processes.  Processes library.`

Zoonomen directories.
Root contains mostly front page html for website.
./avtax

	see below.

./avtax/tools/

	contains mostly shell scripts for various functions.
	see below.
./zoonomen/bio
./zoonomen/cite

./zoonomen/bio
	contains an alphabetical listing of taxon author
	data and associated data (and contains question as well).

./zoonomen/cit [from "citation"]

	contains a alphabetical list of files "jour[a-z].html"

	The main subdivisions include:

		AMNH/ = Amer.Mus.Nat.Hist. pubs.
		AOUCL/ = AOUCL's
		BNMA/ = Birds of North and Middle America OCR versions. 
		CBA/ = Catalogue of Birds of the Americas OCR versions.
		CBBM/ = Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus. OCR versions.
		CWR/ = subdirectory containing many subdirectories
				of Richmond associated files and images.
		Dates of Publication/ = Copr of jpgs or Richmonds
				Card index on dates of publication.
		Peters/ = OCR copies of Peters Birds of the world.
		RI/ = many subdirectories of Richmond Index files and images.
		SharpHL/ = OCR version of Sharpe's HandList.
		Sundevall/
		SystAvAust/
		SystAvNeot/
		Types/
		bak/
		image/
		sb/
		src/ = sources (various)
		ss/ = spreadsheet (Excel) versions of a number of important
				works.


Zoonomen files: naming, organization, use.

1. All files are ascii text files. HTML.
	I have not kept them up to date with the html
	conventions as these continuously change.
	The initial HTML versions of these files
	were written in the mid 1990's.

2. Taxonomic files.
	
	Naming convention:

	These "base files consist of files RESTRICTED to html files
	with FOUR character lower case alphanumeric prefix. 
	thus "stru.html"

	These files are the individual entities that are the edited entities.
	Date and version information is maintained in each file.
	In my directory /zoonomen/avtax they are the ONLY files
	with ????.html names allowed.

		[Note: If I were to start over I expect I would have used
		??????.html or possibly even 8 charactes to allow more
		intuitive readability of the contents. The files
		necessarily require frequent re-shuffling of the overall 
		sequence as

	These ????.html files contain subspecies listing that are tab indented.
	Thus species records begin with '^<li>'
	subspecies records begin with '^	<li>'

	ORDERS are enclosed in <h1>...</h1>
	The vulgar name for orders are enclosed in <h3>...</h3>.

	GENERA are enclosed with '<h4 id="Name"> ....</h4>

	For Non-passerines the individual files contain an ORDER,
	and the contents are usually identifiable my the file name.

	If this were done for Passerines the result would be a single
	VERY large file, and rearrangement would require editing
	the entire file.

	Therefore, passeriformes is split into individual files
	containing Families.

	The file naming convention here is the file name starts wit "pa"
	and has two additional subsequent alphanumeric characters.
	The resulting file names are not intuitively recognizable as to the
	included family.

	These family "component files" all contain subspecies.
	A file of passeriformes with listing ONLY down to species level
	is created from these files.

Process library:

	My start file (executed with the shell starts)
	looks like this:

	[General]

	alias e=egrep
		# I use egrep so much I simply shorten the command to e.

	alias lc=c:/zoonomen/avtax/lc.sh
		# allows an ls like function that lists only directories

	[file updating/manipulating tools.]

	alias update=c:/zoonomen/avtax/update.sh

	[Primary taxon searching tools]


        alias f=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/f.sh

                # string searches across ????.html files to find
                        which contains the string.
                        equivalent, obviously, to egrep -l 'string' ????.html

        alias q=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/auyr.sh

                # useful and complex tool allows
                database search funtions across all the primary files.
                many component files within this.. see below.


	[Source searching tools]

	alias i=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/i.sh
		# allows string search of Index Animalium.
	alias p=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/p.sh
		# allows string search of 16 volumes of Peters CL
	alias b=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/b.sh
		# allows string search across all volumes of the 
			Cats.Birds.Brit.Mus.

	alias rq=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/rq.sh
		# allows string search of richmond index 
		(searches titles of card links).
	alias h=c:/zoonomen/avtax/tools/h.sh
		# allows string search of Hellmayr (CBA)
	alias pet=c:/zoonomen/avtax/pet.sh
		# allows string search of Peters CL
	alias ioc=c:/zoonomen/avtax/ioc.sh

	alias cba=c:/zoonomen/avtax/cba.sh
		# search older un OCR corrected versions
		of CBA.. deprecated for h.sh


Minimal files and proceedures needed to do useful things with my data.

1.) For source searching:
	Needed: 
	Copies of OCR versions of sources. 
	I have these for: 
		CBBM, CBA, IndexAnimalium, Ridgway BMNA, 
		Peters CL, Sharpe's Handlist

	You can download my versions of the files from GitHub. 
	Or download your own OCR text files from various sources.
	Note: My versions include thousands,, ok maybe tens of thousands
	of OCR correction edits.
	That number sounds impressive but it is trivial to carry out specific
	string edits across, for example, all volumes of the CBBM.

	ALMOST needed -- the ability to edit ascii text files.
	There are MANY excellent text editors available and it is
	a certainty that one or several are already on your computer.
	I find "Notepad" to be quite poor and I edit with several
	versions of vi (also vim).
	vi exists on every Apple computer ever made, and it is part of every
	shell (e.g. git bash shell).

	[Side note rant.. recommend you skip this.
	If you are not willing to edit ascii files, or not willing to learn
	to use a simple text editor, I suggest you not waste your time here
	but return to the land where you are an application-enslaved menial.
	I see it as like deciding you dont want to learn to drive, others 
	(enamoured of their expensive purchased applications and 
	delighted to be restricted by them) disagree.]


	Once you have source files (like the Peters CL) in a directory
	of their own (I recommend giving each its own directory)
