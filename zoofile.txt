Files, directories, processes.

Processes library.`

Zoonomen directories.
Root contains mostly front page html for website.
./avtax

	see below.
./bio
./cite

./bio
	contains an alphabetical listing of taxon author
	data and associated data (and contains question as well).

./cit [from "citation"]

	contains a alphabetical list of files "jour[a-z].html"

	The main subdivisions include:

		AMNH/ = Amer.Mus.Nat.Hist. pubs.
		AOUCL/ = AOUCL's
		BNMA/ = Birds of North and Middle America OCR versions. 
		CBA/ = Catalogue of Birds of the Americas OCR versions.
		CBBM/ = Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus. OCR versions.
		CWR/ = subdirectory containing many subdirectories
				of Richmond associated files and images.
		Dates of Publication/ = Copr of jpgs or Richmonds
				Card index on dates of publication.
		Peters/ = OCR copies of Peters Birds of the world.
		RI/ = many subdirectories of Richmond Index files and images.
		SharpHL/ = OCR version of Sharpe's HandList.
		Sundevall/
		SystAvAust/
		SystAvNeot/
		Types/
		bak/
		image/
		sb/
		src/ = sources (various)
		ss/ = spreadsheet (Excel) versions of a number of important
				works.


Zoonomen files: naming, organization, use.

1. All files are ascii text files. HTML.
	I have not kept them up to date with the html
	conventions as these continuously change.
	The initial HTML versions of these files
	were written in the mid 1990's.

2. Taxonomic files.
	
	Naming convention:

	These "base files consist of files RESTRICTED to html files
	with FOUR character lower case alphanumeric prefix. 
	thus "stru.html"

	These files are the individual entities that are the edited entities.
	Date and version information is maintained in each file.
	In my directory /zoonomen/avtax they are the ONLY files
	with ????.html names allowed.

		[Note: If I were to start over I expect I would have used
		??????.html or possibly even 8 charactes to allow more
		intuitive readability of the contents. The files
		necessarily require frequent re-shuffling of the overall 
		sequence as

	These ????.html files contain subspecies listing that are tab indented.
	Thus species records begin with '^<li>'
	subspecies records begin with '^	<li>'

	ORDERS are enclosed in <h1>...</h1>
	The vulgar name for orders are enclosed in <h3>...</h3>.

	GENERA are enclosed with '<h4 id="Name"> ....</h4>

	For Non-passerines the individual files contain an ORDER,
	and the contents are usually identifiable my the file name.

	If this were done for Passerines the result would be a single
	VERY large file, and rearrangement would require editing
	the entire file.

	Therefore, passeriformes is split into individual files
	containing Families.

	The file naming convention here is the file name starts wit "pa"
	and has two additional subsequent alphanumeric characters.
	The resulting file names are not intuitively recognizable as to the
	included family.

	These family "component files" all contain subspecies.
	A file of passeriformes with listing ONLY down to species level
	is created from these files.
