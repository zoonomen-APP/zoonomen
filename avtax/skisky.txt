Surname ending
-sky vs -ski vs -skii.

All three of these are used, and often used interchangeably.
At present list appears to default to -ski -- viz:

Banjkovski, VB
Belopolski, LO
Berezowski, M
Debski, I
Domaniewski, J
Dybowski, B
Gaskin, CP
Przewalski, NM
Serebrovski, PV
Snigirewski, SI
Taczanowski, L
Tarnovski, GV
Weimerskirch, H
Zaliesski, IM

and only

Kinsky, FC
Milensky, CM

currently with -sky endings.

NOTE, however, that most, and possibly all of the names listed here
with -ski endings CAN be found with -sky endings.


Also the question of transliterating v vs w.
Do we want to simply adopt one or the other, try to follow "prevaliing use",
or use it as a way of transmitting information (for example v for Russian;
w for Polish).

What about double s?

Double ss is extremely common in renderings of non-slavic names
but uncommon in OUR representation of slavic names.
