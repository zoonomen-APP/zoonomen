	<li>As Colin Jones points out (2010.12.04) others have commented that
	there is no reason that Mathews' proposal of a replacement name
	for <i>Barbatula jacksoni</i> Sclater, 1930, <i>not</i> Sharpe, 1897
	is not valid, as it seems to be held by Peters Checklist <b>VI</b>:47.</li>
	<li>2021.02.25; However ICZN Opinion 138 would appear to  indicate that 
		Mathews' replacement proposal is not satisfactorily complete,
		and thus invalid.</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>XIV</b>:362 dates this as "1862-1863", an orthography that is
	<b>sometimes</b>, but not always, follwed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> 
	(see for example: 
		<b>Hypargos</b> H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:728 ("1862-63")

Spermophaga haematina <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:728 dates this to 1805 without discussion.</li>
	<li>It is difficult to see a logical basis for the date of 1805, as three taxa that occur 
	<b>earlier</b> in the Ois.Chant. are dated to 1807!!<ul>
	<li><i>Lonchura atricapilla </i>(Vieillot) [pl.LIII]

		H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:735</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>All these taxa are dated to <b>post</b> 1807 by Sherborn in the Index Animalium, 
	which most probably 
	was not consulted by the authors of H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>, or Peters 
	Checklist <b>XIV</b> (= Traylor in this instance).</li>
	<li>The Peters Checklist dating of "1805" quite possibly resulted from uncritically
	following the CBBM <b>13</b>:498 citation. I know that, as in my own case, it is difficult
	to say if blind repetition of previous citations represents mere lazyness, or inappropriate
	reverence for workers who have come before.</li>

<li>Sherborn, in Index Animalium (p.2887) shows the word with the -ae- diphthong.</li>
<li>I am attempting to have the original work examined to settle this matter.</li>
<li>(2009.1.211) Daria Wingreen-Mason of the Cullman Library, Smithsonian Institution has kindly looked 
into this for me. The spelling of the Latin binomen appears to be indeterminate as to -oe- versus
-ae-, however it is clearly rendered as -ae- in several locations in the work, 
so for the moment I accept
-ae- as most probably correct.</li>

Luscinia megarhynchos hafizi <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>In his Corrigenda 7 to H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> Dickinson writes:<pre>
<i>Luscinia megarhynchos golzii</i> Cabanis, 1873 replaces <i>hafizi</i> Severzov, 1873; 
priority cl[ai]med for the latter based on erroneous presumption that Severzov's 
work appeared in late 1872. [ECD in press].</pre>.</li>

<li>ECD's work was published in 2008 [Dickinson,EC. 2008. "The name of the easternmost 
population of Common Nightingale <i>Luscinia megarhynchos</i>" BBOC <b>128</b>(2):141-142] 
where Dickinson notes that Dementiev (1932) substituted <i>hafizi</i> for <i>golzii</i> evidently
based on the Severtsov's claim (1875) that his "Vert...." had appeared in "December 1872".</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:41 (= Ripley 1964) does not appear to have assumed that Severtzov's publication was "late in 1872", as his citation reads:<pre>
<i>Luscinia Hafizi</i> Severtzov, 1873, Veritkal . . . Turkest.
	Zhivotn., (1872), p. 120</pre>
In this volume of the Peters Checklist, the parentheses "(1872)" indicates the imprint date, but 
"1873" (without parentheses) is the taxonomic date (<i>i.e.</i> the date of publication). The 
basis for Ripley assuming Severtzov's priority over Cabanis is not clear to me.  </li>

<li>Severtzov's claim that his publication appeared in "December 1872" is not 
necessarily inconsistent with an imprint date of 1873. Severtzov would have been referring to
and Old Style date, and, for example Dec. 31, 1872 (O.S.) = Jan. 12, 1873 (N.S.). It is a possibility
(though a speculative one) that the imprint date might be (N.S.) as the target audience would be
predominantly western europeans where the New Style calender had been long adopted. 
(The N.S. calender was not adopted in Russia until 1918). Additionally, Kees Rooselaar communicates
(<i>in litt.</i> 2005.01.05) that his copy of Severtzov's paper (with an imprint date of "1873"
also bears the words (heavily underlined) 
"Izdanie obschestvo" 
(&#1048;&#1079;&#1076;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1079; &#1054;&#1073;&#1097;&#1077;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086;) which means public/general printing/publication. Addiionally Roselaar provides other
evidence that this work may have had prior parts or editions published and distributed, 
and that the 1873 imprint may relate to the summary of all the articles published in this work 
starting in 1871). Indeed, as Roselaar notes: Gould published in 1872 (Birds Asia pt 25 pl.15) <i>Passer ammodendri</i> that is said (?by whom) to be based on Severtzov's "work".</li>

<li>The date of Severtzov's publication is only one of the problems here. 
The date of the Cabanis name (<i>Lwscinia golzii</i>) is <strong>also</strong> a problem 
in my view. This name is found
in the "January" number (no.122) of the J.Orn. At this time virtually all the numbers of the J.Orn.
were delayed and at present I don't know of any that have been demonstrated to have
been published during the month stated for the issue. There is much uncertainty as to when the 
numbers actually appeared. It is overwhelmingly likely that the "Jan." number did not 
appear in January, and it is <strong>probable</strong> but not certain, 
that no.122 appeared before "June or later" of that 
year when the "Marz" issue (no.122) was published.</li>

<li>It is a difficult problem resolving priority when both contending publications are 
uncertain as to the date of publication. One approach would be to consider both publications to be
dated to Dec. 31, 1873 (though this seems unreasonable) and the select one of the two.</li>
<li>For the moment I use the name that <strong>appears</strong> to me to have substantially 
the greatest probability of having been published first, but emphasize that 
uncertanties exist as to both the data and how the Code can, or should, 
be applied in such an instance.</li>
<li>Certainly many speculative possibilities exist here concerning the dating possibilities,
multiple editions of the work, possible circulation of unpublished manuscripts, &amp;c, &ampp;c.</li><li>It seems premature to me to imagine that this case is resolved.</li>

Mimus gundlachii hillii <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>IX</b>:445 (Davis &amp; Miller 1960) to 1863, and 
	this is followed by other modern authors. </li>
	<li>We know that during this periond the numbers of the Philadelphia proceedings
	were virtually never published on the date specified, so we must try to ascertain
	the first evidence that it was in existence as a published work.</li>
	<li>The receipt of this number was acknowledged at the Smithsonian Institution on
	27 January, 1864.</li>
	<li>The records at the American Philosophical Society are not helpful in this instance,
	as we only know that numbers 4-6 (this name is in number 6) were received sometime
	between Sept. 1863 and Feb. 1864. (No.4 is the Jun-Jul '63 number).</li>
	<li>Thus in my view, we know that the imprint date is incorrect, and to date the 
	earliest that we have evidence for this being in existence as a published work is
	Jan. of 1864. My understanding of the Code would require the use of 1864 for this taxon
	unless and until additional data comes forward demonstrating it was published
	in 1863.</li>

Campylorhynchus rufinucha humilis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>9</b>:382 (= Paynter 1960) cites this to 1856, without comment.</li>
<li>This is followed, also without comment, by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:634.</li>
<li>This taxon is described on p.263 which is in "no. VI" for the year 1856. The evidence is
that this was not published until 1857, and indeed both the Peters Checklist and H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> cite other taxa from "no.VI" (pp.259-327) to 1857 without comment (see, for example <i>Agelastes niger</i> H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:40; Peters Checklist <b>2</b>:133).</li>
<li>One might speculate that H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> and Peters 
Checklist should be ignored for all taxon dates coming from the 
Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. For Peters Checklist, 
at least, the authors demonstrate their awareness of which taxa are cited to this source. 
With H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> the problem is more challenging, as it is not 
clear if the authors themselves know which taxa are cited from this serial.
One approach would be to hold as uncertain all dates that fall in the range covered by 
the Proceedings -- currently for my data that covers 1843 through 1959 which seems to be 
an unworkably large span.</li>
<li>The difficulty of determining certain dates from the PANSP should not be underestimated, and
despite hard work by many careful and knowledgable workers, certainty is not always to be had.</li>

Ptyrticus turdinus harterti <strong>Citation Author</strong>
<ul>
<li>I am a bit uncertain as to the author of this taxon. Peters CL <b>10</b>:262 lists the author as Stresemann,
as does the Richmond Index. H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:602 lists the author as Stresemann, but in Corrigenda 2.1 says the author is Grote, not Stresemann and simply says this is an error in Peters, but provides no supporting details or rationale.</li>
<li>Additionally, H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:255 cites another taxon (<i>Hemiprocne mystacea aeroplanes</i>) from this same page to Stresemann.</li>
<li>The author may very well be Grote, but until more support for this assertion is available I will list the authority shown in the Richmond Index and in Peters Checklist.</li>
<li>In a case like this, without primary data available to me, the decision must be made on the basis of authority alone. Those authorities compete here and the burden of
proof would appear to rest on H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> in its assertion that both Richmond and Peters are wrong.</li>
<li>In support of the possibility that the author is Grote, is the fact that Crote is afforded the authority for <i>Emberiza affinis vulpecula</i> by Peters Checklist <b>13</b>:25 [= Paynter], and this taxon if found on the page following <i>Ptyrticus turdinus harterti</i>. In contrast the Richmond Index attributes the authority for the Emberiza to Stresemann.</li>
<li>So the issue is not resolved for this name, but absent any supporting data, I can not afford authority to H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> over both Peters and the Richmond Index.</li> 
<li>Stefan Eckert very helpfully supplied the answer to this (2009.02.06). His
scan of the relevant portion of the publication shows that the description was 
indicated as supplied by Grote.</li>
<li>Thanks very much to Stefan for solving this.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index cites both names from this article to '"Jerd. &amp; Blyth" Blyth 1861'. I have not seen the article

<li>[2010.02.23] All taxa in this article by Blyth are treated the same way, with the new name
followed by "Jerdon &amp; Blyth", though <b>none</b> of the text is in quotes.</li>
<li>Despite this consistent treatment <b>within</b> the article, H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> does not treat these names consistently with regards the authority: <b>Tickellia</b> is attributed to Blyth (p.594) but attributes <i>Orthotomus cucullatus coronatus</i> (p.563) to Jerdon &amp; Blyth (see Corrigenda 2.1); and also treats <i>Brachypteryx hyperythra</i> (p.673) to Jerdon &amp; Blyth.</li>
<li>Most probably "Jerdon &amp; Blyth" was intended for <b>Tickellia</b> as well, but I believe
that a rationale should be provided for including Jerdon's name, given that the article is by Blyth, and no quoted material from Jerdon is included.</li>

with a note concerning Ticehurst's restricting the type to Sikkim (1925, BBOC, <b>46</b> p.22).</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:510 further has a footnote (#3) indicating Deignan 1963 (not seen)
"used <i>himalayana</i> Jerdon, 1864. The case is being investigated separately."</li>

<li>Ticehurst's 1925 BBOC entry says:<pre>Blyth described <i>D. himalayensis</i> from "the Himalayas." 
No hint is given whence his type came, but in his 'Catalogue' he
mentions specimens from Darjeeling, and therefore I [Ticehurst] restrict the type
locality of <i>D. himalayensis</i> to Sikkim."</pre></li>

<li>The Richmond Index has a card for the Jerdon 1864 name in which he
quotes Blyth's communication to him about the bird that occurs "throughout
the Himalayas, and ... very rarely on the hills of Southern India" Jerdon
goes on to say:<pre>"This is, writes Mr Blyth, distinct from true <u>Dendrocitta
sinensis</u>, and that naturalist suggests for it the name of

<li>It appears that Ticehurst (1925) was unaware of Jerdon's 1864 publication of the name <i>Dendrocitta himalayana</i>,
a Blyth manuscript name.</li>

Number 104 of the J.Orn is the "M&auml;rz" volume so the problem becomes trying to

was published.</li>
</ol>
<li>Dickinson 2005. J.Zool. <b>266</b>:427-430 does not help, in that he only
indicates (p.428) that pp.467-698 were published in the "next year" (=1870).</li>
<li> However the Richmond Index indicates that pt3 of the "1869" volume was published
in March of 1870.</li>
<li>Next we must consider if J.Orn. no.104 was actually published in March -- a
probability that is very small. Sure enough, on examining no.104 on
p.158, we find a letter footed "Berlin, im April 1870.". So we know it was not
published in March, and without further evidence must date it to Dec. 31, 1870.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index differs in two aspects here:<ol>
	<li>The spelling of the specific epithet has a single <i>-i</i> ending, as
	<i>Apteryx haasti</i></li>
	<li>The name apparently was first published (Jan. 1872) in the Ibis on p.35;

<li>Interestingly the CBBM <b>26</b>:611 has the spelling correct as <i>Apteryx
haasti</i> (single <i>-i</i> ending); but perhaps this was not consulted by
Mayr.</li> 
<li>In reviewing the original publication in the Ibis (BioDiversity Heratige Site, online 2009.03.10) more details are apparent.<ol>

number of the serial to "21" (!!) for <i>peninsulae</i>. It seems clear that someone
recognized that the citations didn't make
sense for the same volume and page but two different years, but the solution to this
problem does not seem to have invovled examining the original material (as I myself have
not done) or seeking other sources for resolution. The solution appears to me to have been
to fabricate a resolution that was unrestrained by facts.</li>

<ul> 
<li>Mann CF &amp; Cheke RA. 2006. "The validity of the sunbird genus
<b>Hedydipna</b>" BBOC <b>126</b>(3):199-200 argue that Hedydipna is invalid, and that the valid
genus group name is <b>Anthodiaeta</b> Cabanis 1850.</li> 
<li>Their argument is that by "position precedence" <b>Anthodiaeta</b> has precedence over
<b>Hedydipna</b>; in support they cite "ICZN 1999: 73, 295". Page 295 is in the English Index and
lists:<pre>
Precedence (<i>contd.</i>)
	....
	"position" (line or page) precedence, 69A.8-10</pre>
Page 73 includes the final portions of Article 69 <b>Fixation of type species not fixed in the
original publication.</b> <ul>
<li>First, it appears to me that the type species <b>is</b> fixed in the
original publication for both <b>Anthodiaeta</b> (type = <i>Cinnyris collaris</i> Vieillot) and for
<b>Hedydipna</b> where in the footnote "*" it states:<pre>
Typen der Gruppe ist: <b>H. platyura.</b> -- Cinnyris platura Vieill.</pre>
(note the discrpancy in the spelling <i>platyura</i>/<i>platura</i>).</li>
<li>Even if Article 69 were apt (and I think it is not) the most applicable portion seems to be
<b>Recommentaion 69A</b> Example 69A.10. which reads:
<pre>All other things being equal, preference should be given to the nominal species 
cited first in the work, page or line ("position precedence").</pre>
This is the only occurance in the body of the Code of the string "position precedence", and it must
certainly be what Mann &amp; Cheke are intending to apply here. However this Recommendation example
applies only to selection of a type species within a genus, and only when "all other things [are]
equal."</li>
<li>It seems to me that the validity of the genus <b>Hedydipna</b> turns more on its use by previous
authors (Mann &amp; Cheke list at least Zedlitz (1910), Madar&agrave;sz (1915), van Someren (1920),
Sclater (1930), Mackworth-Praed &amp; Grant (1955), and Irwin (1999)), than on the application of
a Recommendation example intended to guide workers in the selection of a type species.</li>
</ul>(2006.10.08)
<p>
<li>Additional work on this mattershows further difficulties with
the approach of Mann &amp; Cheke.</li> 
<ul>

	<li>Mann &amp; Cheke (BBOC 2006) overlooked Wolters's actions where
	he acted as First Reviser in 1977 (Bonn.Zool.Beitr. 28 Hefte1,2
	p.86), repeated in 1979 (Die Vogelarten der Erde p.275).
	<b>Anthodiaeta</b> is available and valid for
	treating <i>collaris</i> in a separate genus alongside
	<b>Hedydipna</b> but <b>Hedydipna</b> must be used
	when <i>collaris</i> and <i>platurus</i> are treated as congeneric
	outside <b>Anthreptes</b>.</li>

Podiceps grisgena holbollii <strong>Nomenclature (spelling)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originally spelled <i>Podiceps Holb&ouml;llii</i>.</li>
<li>This spelling was changed to <i>Podiceps holboellii</i> in Peters Checklist
<b>1</b>(2):151, and this spelling has been followed without question or comment by
many others (e.g. H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:80; HBW <b>1</b>:192; AOU CL
7<sup>th</sup>:8, &amp;c.). This bird was named after Capt. Carl Holb&ouml;ll (as
indicated in the Richmond Index) and spelling the specific epithet
"<i>holboellii</i>" would be correct if the Capt. was German. (ICZN Code Art.
32.5.2.1) otherwise "<i>holbollii</i>" is correct.</li>
<li>The Mearnses in "Biographies for Birdwatchers" 1988 p.[197] write
regarding Carl Peter Holb&ouml;ll :<pre>
	Holb&ouml;ll was a Danish zoologist whose long association with Greenland lasted
	from the 1820's until his death in 1856, when a ship that was taking him from
	Copenhagen to Greenland sank and disappeared without a trace. During his visits
	to the north he travelled extensively and took every opportunity to
	collect for
	teh Royal Natural History Museum at Copenhagen. ...</pre>
<li>It appears that Richmond was incorrect about Holb&ouml;ll being a Captain
of the ship but quite clearly Holb&ouml;ll was not German.  The spelling
"<i>holboellii</i>" is inconsistent with the Code.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia biographical sketch indicates that Holb&ouml;ll was an
officer in the Danish Navy.</li>

Hamirostra <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li> There are two problems with this citation, the date, and how to
cite it.</li>
<li>Cited by various authors to 1845 or 1846, and it appears that these
two may be impossible to distinguish. Citing it as 1846 are <ol> 
	<li>Mathews &amp; Iredale 1922 AustralAv.Rec. <b>4</b>:167 (not
	seen)</li> 
	<li>The Richmond Index (citing Mathews)</li>
	 <li>Peters <b>1</b>(2):296 (=Mayr &amp; Cottrell).</li>
	 </ol>
	Citing it as 1845 are: <ol> 
	<li>Sherborn 1927; (Ind.Anim. p.2907)</li>
	<li>Neave 1939 <b>2</b>:560</li>
	<li>Schulze <i>et al.</i> 1930 p.1461.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Sherborn almost certainly would have been aware of the Mathews &amp;
Iredale article, but in his publication five years later appears not to
have agreed, either on the basis of logic, or perhaps on the basis of
additional information unknown to Mathews &amp; Iredale.</li>
<li>It is my suspicion that with internal
referencing it boils down to Sherborn 1927 versus Mathews &amp; Iredale
1922.  Further complicating the matter, this work is not discussed by
Zimmer, but is discussed by Mengel 1972 Cat.EllisColl.Orn.BooksU.Kans.
<b>1</b>: 220-222.  As one would expect, Mengel's treatment is one that
would make Zimmer envious. He appears to interpret Mathews &amp; Iredale
as presenting evidence for citing at least part of the work to
1845.</li>
<li>The imprint date on the work appears to be 1846 but this appears to
have been issued with part XII, while the genus group name
<b>Hamirostra</b> appears in part VIII.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2) cites this name to "pt. 8, p.12." The
bibliographic work in this volume of Peters is emphatically not its
strong point. No other workers that I know of refer to "p.12", but
rather to "sign. B4". In my view this reduces the weight of validity of
the Peters (=Mayr &amp; Cottrell) treatment, and thus detracts
<b>some</b> weight from favoring the 1846 interpretation.</li>
<li>I choose to follow 1845, though it is not a clear call. I am most
strongly influenced by the fact that <b>later</b> knowledgable workers
seem to use 1845 (though they may all simply be following
Sherborn).</li>

Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera halmaturina <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:426 (Salomonsen) indicates that the
original taxon name here is <i>Meliornis (Lichmera) australasiana</i>
subsp. <i>halmaturina</i>.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index lists the taxon (with the same but more
detailed citation) as <i>Meliornis novae-hollandiae</i>
[<i>halmaturina</i>],</li>
<li>It is not impossible, but in my view certainly unlikely, that the
Salomonsen representation is correct.</li>
<li>Of interest, Salomonsen <b>also</b> lists the <i>Meliornis
novae-hollandiae</i> <i>halmaturina</i> taxon to the same volume
and page and as a synonym of <i>Phylidornis novaehollandiae
cambelli</i> (!). My impression is that if all this had any remote
relationship to "science", more explanation would be provided. Rather,
it give the impression of "truths" handed down from
authorities-on-high. (Otherwise known as "fair targets"). I would
not be surprised if Salomonsen wanted to provide much more explanation
here. He had, however, to deal with a Harvard publication and this was
no doubt the very best that they could do.</li>

writes:<pre>
Well, you have opened up a can of worms on <i> Psephotus haematogaster</i>
Gould. Your PDF down-loaded OK; and I know now that I overlooked this
reference in the CR when compiling the Zoo. Cat., otherwise I would have
made mention of it towards clearing up the authority and place of
publication of what we currently know as <i>N. h. haematorrhous</i>
(Bpte).

What the ref in the CR does is to propose a new name for <i>Ps.
haematogaster</i> Gould, a name which Gould first applied to the
yellow-vented Bluebonnet in 1838 and then to the red-vented Bluenbonnet in
1848 (or earlier part) in The Birds of Australia.  The trouble is,
Bonaparte's text does not make it clear to which of those two taxa his
<i>nomen novum</i> applies. One could assume that he means the red-vented
form, both from the meaning of <i>haematorrhous</i> and the fact that he
described the yellow-vented form as <i>xanthorrhous</i> in 1850. But this
is not specified, a lack made more significant by the fact that Bonaparte
says in the CR reference that <i>haematogaster</i> Gould is a
misidentification for <i>Platycercus flaveolus</i> Gould instead.

Because of this, it would be reasonable if not natural to interpret
<i>haematorrhous</i> Bpte, May 1856 in the CR as a new name for
<i>haematogaster</i> Gould 1838 (= yellow-vented form), with the same
type, in which case <i>haematorrhous</i> Bpte, August 1856 in Naumannia 
(where it is based by reference on the red-vented form in Gould's Birds of
Australia 1848 - as I recall checking?) would be a junior homonym.  This
means that a later synonym of <i>haematorrhous</i> Bpte, August 1856 would
be needed as the valid name for the red-vented form!   <i>N. h. zanda</i>
Mathews, 1913, would be that name - yuk.

I still have to check again that the reference for <i>haematorrhous</i> in
Naumannia is specific for the form in Gould's Birds of Australia.  But in
the interim, I think the wisest course to maintain stability is to
treat <i>Psephotus haematorrhous</i> Bpte in the CR as a <i>nomen
dubium</i> and, like names for hybrids, not valid for any
taxon.</pre></li>

	I've just received an e-mail from Mirna Casagrande, current editor
	of Revista Brasileira de Zoologia. She says that the issue from 1989
	was indeed release in that year, in the week between Christmas and
	New Year. The date presented in the cover is the last day of the
	trimester. She also says that since the editor in that time was Dr.
	Albino, a taxonomist and professor of the ICNZ, he would not let the
	journal be printed with a date prior to its release.
 
    There is some evidence to show that some copies were received
    surprisingly late but in the face of the above e-mail (and I gather
    the testimony of Jacques Vielliard) I believe that the official date

Megalaima lineata hodgsoni <strong>Nomenclature</strong> <ul> 
<li>Originally described in <b>Megalaimus</b></li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>6</b>:33 puts
the author's name in parentheses, interpreting <b>Megalaimus</b> to be
different from <b>Megalaima</b>.  This is followed by HBW <b>7</b>:200 and
H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:305, and in neither case does this appear to warrant
discussion.</li> 

<li>ICZN 1999 51.3.1 states:<pre> 51.3.1 Parentheses are not
used when the species-group name was originally combined with an incorrect
spelling or an emendation of the generic name (this applies even though an
unjustified emendation is an available name with its own authorship and date
[Art. 33.2.3]).</pre></li> 

<li>Thus it appears that at least HBW and H&amp;M
consider <b>Megalaimus</b> to be something other than an emendation or
incorrect spelling.</li> 

<li>To date, I am unable to find any indication that
<b>Megalaimus</b> was proposed as a distinct generic entity. Thus I
interpret it to be an emendation and do not use parentheses around the author's
name. If <b>Megalaimus</b> was proposed distinctly as a genus, and is not a
misspelling or emendation I would be very eager to know of the facts supporting
that case. I do not find <b>Magalaimus</b> in Sherborn, Naeve, Richmond, or
Shulze.</li>

  The varied colouring of this bird, and particularly the uniform
slivery bluish grey of its under surface, afford a ready distinction
of it from all the other <i>Toucans</i>.  Its upper mandible is edged on
its basal aspect by a narrow line of yellow, succeeded by a tri-
angular spot of black; the follows an irregular mark of yellow
edged by a narrow irregular black line; the rest of the upper
mandible throughout the whole of its <i>culmen</i> and sides is deep blood
red : the lower mandible, for the basal half of its length, has the 
yellow and black colouring of the upper, but instead of terminating
in red, this colour is exchanged for deep black.</pre></li>

<li>The listing in the front of vol. 55 gives the date:<br>
"[Hefte] 4 ([side] 177-243 &amp; I-VIII): 10. jan. 1962."</li>
<li>Thanks to the useful and diligent efforts of Edward Dickinson and Jon
Fjelds&aring; the story here becomes more complex.</li><ul>
	<li>Edward Dickinson has a copy of a separate of this article. The
	presence of a separate raises the possibility that it was issued prior
	to the completed number of the journal, and in support of this the
	cover of the separate has listed below the title:<pre>
	Dansk Ornithologisk Forenings Tidsskrift, <b>55</b>, 1961, p.219</pre>
	</li>
	<li>The "1961" could be interpreted as a publication date, or as a
	"volume date".</li>
	<li>Jon Fjelds&aring; has determined several facts of importance:
	Evidently at this time it was common to delay the mailing of these
	journal materials so that all the Christmas mail could be processed.
	This would appear to account for the delay (until 10 Jan. 1962) for the
	final number of this volume. However, in addition there was significant
	urgency attached to distributing the first reports of these
	expeditions, and this urgency would have been particularly strong in
	this instance. Jon writes (2005.11.23)<pre>
	I spoke with Dr. Torben Wolff (editor of  papers from the two "large"
	Danish collecting efforts in the Indo-Malayan area, Galathea in 1950-52
	and Noona Dan 1961-62). He does not have any record of when reprints
	were sent out and he doubts very much that Finn would have kept a
	record of this. But he does remember that high priority was given to
	rapidly produce reprints with the first results of the expedition. As
	is apparent from the front page of the reprint, this was the first
	"Noona Dan paper". This paper may have been particularly urgent since
	the collector, taxidermist Erik Pedersen, died during the field work on
	Palawan. Collected material was sent home together with the coffin, and
	Finn was eager that EP's new bird was rapidly published, before Finn
	had to leave DK himself to join the Melanesian part of the expedition
	in 1962.  
	It is therefore likely that reprints were produced and mailed
	out before the issue of Dansk Orn.Foren.Tidsskr. was mailed out.
	However, it is not possible to provide documentation for this.</pre>
	</li>
	<li>Subsequently, Dickinson has found a preprint with a wrapper dated
	1961, and while it is possible that it may not have been issued
	until 1962, I agree that this dated wrapper makes it most reasonable
	to date the taxon to 1961.</li>

the Latin word <i>hybrida</i> is a masculine noun, not a feminine adjective. The fact that

nomenclature is irrelevant here because modern scientific Latin is not included in the

<p>
Podiceps holboellii <strong>systematics  </strong>
<p>
Thanks to Normand David for bringing this to my attention. His note reads:<p>
"A case has been made for placing <i> Colymbus major</i> Boddaert, 1783 
(= <i>Podiceps major</i>) in the newly established monotypic genus 
<b>Podicephorus</b> Bochenski, 1994.<p>

<cite>Bochenski, Z. B. 1994. The comparative osteology of grebes (Aves:
Podicipediformes) and its systematic implications. Acta zool. cracov. 37
(1): 191-346.</cite><p>

The summary reads: "...a revision of the genus <b>Podiceps</b> is proposed, 
to the effect that 1) the species "Podiceps" major is placed in a new 
monotypic genus <b>Podicephorus</b>, and 2) <i>Podiceps grisegena grisegena</i> 
and <i>P. g. holboellii</i> are restored to their species status".<p>
So it appears on the basis of osteological evidence this is elevated to 
full species status.<p>
Note however, that the AOU CL 7<sup>th</sup> ed. notes (p.8) that Storer 1996 Auk 113: 974-975 
in a review	argues against this split.

<li>It seems unlikely that the figure pertains to the Genus, and not the species as the opposite
is usually the case.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index and Sherborn both give Birds of W. Africa as the
source, and are thus not helpful in resolving this detail.</li>
<li>Based on likelihood and similar reversal errors in Traylor and Mayr's

Trichoglossus haematodus <strong>Concept / name </strong>
<ul>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:148-9  gives "haematod".</li>

Hemprich <strong>Standing as author</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zimmer (1926) argues that due to Hemprich's death in the field 
in 1825 no taxa should be attributed to him. I (and others) followed
 this convention, while others listed him as an author.</li>
<li>Prompted by Edward Dickinson's queries I reconsidered Article 50
 of the ICZN (1999). I have not had the opportunity to examine
 the work in question (Symb.Phys.Aves), but absent any compelling
 evidence to the contrary feel it is appropriate to include
 Hemprich. The Code would appear to require clear evidence <b>in the
 text of the article</b> that <b>only</b> Ehrenberg was involved in
 publishing the names. Zimmer does not present any such evidence, or
 even imply that it exists. His standing would appear to be based on
 the long time between Hemprich's death and the publishing of the
 work.</li>
