Cyclopsitta diophthalma inseparabilis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

Coeligena iris <strong>Citation</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The citation is often (<i>e.g.</i> H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:271; HBW <b>5</b>:631,684
	      	given as "1854", implying the citation as here:<ul>

			
	<li>Coeligena iris (<a href="../../bio/biog.html#Gould"

	target="ref_fr">PZS</a>["1853"]</i> Pt21 no.251 p.61</li></ul>

		However, this was published July 25, 1854.</li>
			<li>The name was published April 16, 1853 in No. 1329 of the Athenaeum.
		This fact was discussed several decades ago and the description there
		reproduced (Bruce &amp; McAllen 1990 p.463) though this literature apparently has been
		ignored by current workers. I believe that description, having priority, is correct. I find no discussion of this

	2. <i>Columba larvata hypoleuca</i> (Salvadori) 1903.  H&amp;M uses this subspecific 
	epithet because they say that when moving <i>C. larvata</i> to <b>Columba</b> from 
	<b>Aplopelia</b>, that <i>C. larvata inornata</i> was preoccupied by <i>Columba inornata</i>.

Passer domesticus indicus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:11 (= Greenway 1962) cites this to 1835, and this appears
	to be followed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:716. The basis for this
	dating by Greenway is not made clear.</li>
	<li>Dating taxa from Jardine and Selby's Ill.Orn. is problematic; the CBBM <b>12</b>:309,
	for example, dates this name to "(c. 1848)". However Sherborn worked on this problem
	and his findings are published in the Ibis, and in his Index Animalium.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index also shows the date as 1831.</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:320 dates <i>Dendrocopos himalayensis</i> from
		pl.116 to 1831 (rather than 1835, as shown in Peters CL) and cites
		Sherborn 1894 for this. <i>Passer domesticus indicus</i> appears to have 
		been missed in this regard.</li>

Copsychus albospecularis inexspectatus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Originally as <i>Copsychus inexspectatus</i>.</li>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:69 (= Ripley 1964) mispells this as <i>inexpectatus</i>
       	both for the original combination and as the subspecific entry.</li>
	<li>Ripley, or the editor(s) perhaps did not bother the check the original publication
	and may have been following Shelley, Birds of Africa II, pt2 p.344 (1900) where the
	incorrect emedation to <i>inexpectatus</i> may have occured first.</li> 
	<li>W.L. Sclater Systema Avium Aethiopicarum II p.489 (1930) also perpetuates this error,
	as does HBW <b>10</b>:763 (= Collar 2005)</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:87 (= Ripley 1964) cites this to volume 1909.</li>
	<li>Of interest on the preceeding page (p.86) he cites the taxon from the following page
	of this work (p.761) (<i>Microchichla scouleri fortis</i>) correctly to 1910!</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:683 initially followed the error in the Peters
	Checklist, but corrected this in Corrigenda 5, when apparenly Mary LeCroy pointed out
	the error.</li>
	<li>It appears that Ripley did not take advantage of the Richmond Index in this instance
	which shows the correct date of 1910. The Richmond Index would have been available to 
	Ripley when he was working on this section of the Peters Checklist, and then
       	was generally available when it was published in 1992 in microfiche.</li>

	<li>The 1846 date would be correct if this was in volume <b>15</b>, but the Richmond Index
	shows that this was in volume <b>XVI</b> for Feb. 1847.</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:660 appears to follow the Peters Checklist in dating this

Gracula religiosa intermedia <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:118 (= Amadon 1962) has difficulty with this citation,
	giving the volume wrong as "8" when in fact it is 13. Probably Amadon misread "XIII" as 
	"VIII". Therefore he dates it to 1844, though even this makes no sense, as
	volume 8 of this serial would have been published in 1838. Amadon also gets the
	original binomen wrong, listing it as "Gracula intermedia" where 
	"Gracula intermedius" is correct.</li>
	<li>This was the "December" issue for 1844, and was not published until 1845. As
	the Richmond Index notes, it contains reference to a Madras paper of Aug. 9, 1845 (!).</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:654 has the date correct, but appears
	to base this on the date given in Tweeddale's Collected Ornithological works.
	Tweeddale (= Arthur Hay) is indeed the author of the taxon, but his Collected Ornithological
	Works is <b>not</b> a reliable source for dating his publications.</li>

Aegithalos caudatus italiae <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Both Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:54 (= Snow 1967) and H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:538
	list the authority in parentheses, though no explanation is given for this in either case.
	Snow, remarkably, lists the original combination (incorrectly) as <i>Aegithalos caudatus italiae</i>.
	The original orthography of the name was <i>&AElig;<small>GITHALUS CAUDATUS ITALIAE</small></i>
	(note: "us" not "os").</li>
	<li>The use of parentheses by these authors, would suggest that they interpret <b>Aegithalus</b> to be not
	only a genus distinctly proposed from <b>Aegithalos</b> but to be the one Rev. Jourdain had in mind
	when describing this bird, though in Snow's case this argument seems weakened by the fact that he was
	not able to get the actual orthography of the original description correct.</li>
	<li><b>Aegithalus</b> was a genus group name proposed by Boie in 1822, and he included both <i>pendulinus</i> and
	<i>caudatus</i> in it. Vigors also used <b>Aegithalus</b> in 1825 (Zool.J. 2 no.7 p.397 footnote) as a 
	monotypic genus containing <i>pendulinus</i>. In 1828, Billberg used the name <b>Aegithalus</b> for 
	<i>Parus biarmicus</i> Linnaeus. Certainly there is confusion here, and it is not clear to me
	what Jourdain knew, or understood when he was proposing this name. Certainly Snow and his editors were
	not able to convey the facts of the case correctly.</li>
	<li>Given the real possibility that Jourdain <b>might</b> have had <b>Aegithalus</b> Boie in mind, I will leave the 
	authority in parentheses.</li>

Corvus macrorhynchos intermedius <strong>Citation</strong>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:274 (= Blake &amp; Vaurie 1962) cite this to <pre>
	1859 Proc. Zool. Soc. London, p.471</pre>
	and this would appear to be nonsense. "p.471" of the "1859" volume would appear in
	Pt.27 pt.IV (pp.353-521) which was published in Feb. of 1860 so either the page, or the year
	supplied by these authors is incorrect.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index shows this to have been published on "p.171" which would place it in
	Pt.27 p.II (pp.129-352) of the 1859 volume.</li>
	<li>Not having seen the original, I chose to follow the more reliable source and cite this to
	1859, and p.171.</li>
	<li>Sharpe CBBM <b>3</b>:20 (1877) cites this name to "p.297" of the 1859 PZS, which also makes
	no sense that I can understand. It appears to be a copying error from the page in Jerdon's B.Ind. <b>2</b>
	where the name apparently is found on p.297.</li>
	<li>After completion of this note, I find that Dickinson, Dekker, Eck, &amp; Somadikarta (Systematic
	notes on Asian Birds. 45. Types of the Corvidae. 2004.) on p.124 note the error on the Peters author's part,
	and correctly cite the bird to p.171.</li>

<ul>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:381 dates this to 1869,
though this was published in 1868. This error results from lack of understanding of the (changing,
confusing and inconsistent) orthography used in the Peters Checklist volumes. Other examples of
this erroneous interpretation are corrected (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Frederickena unduligera unduligera</i>

Cymbilaimus lineatus intermedius <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:154 lists the
authority in parentheses, and this is followed without comment by H&amp;M
3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:379, though HBW <b>8</b>533 (Zimmer &amp; Isler, 2003)
lists the authority without parentheses.</li> 
<li>The Richmond Index shows (in agreement with the Peters Checklist) that the bird
was described as <i>Cymbilanius lineatus intermedius</i> so the question about the
use of parentheses turns on the name <b>Cymbilanius</b>. The Richmond Index indicates
that this name is an emendation of Gray's name <b>Cymbilaimus</b> and explicitly
stating that it is an emendation on three separate cards, and even noting on one
that: <pre>
Sclater actually seems to have thought Gray wrote it <u>Cymbilanius</u> as he quotes
Gray that way!</pre> (this entry for the PZS 1858 pt.26 no.359 p.206 entry).</li>
<li>It seems quite clear that the authority should not be listed in
parentheses, as Hartert and Goodson were using an emendation.</li>

There is no disucssion of the spelling, nor support given for their interpretation

"<i>sic</i>" does <b>not</b> indicates something is an error, but rather means "thus", in

<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:101 also mirrors the Peters Checklist.</li>
<li>HBW <b>2</b>:122, also spells it <b>Ichthyophaga</b> without dicussion or comment.</li>

Richmond 1917 (Proc. US. Nat. Mus., vol. <b>53</b> p. 570, footnote)

Ptilinopus insolitus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<li>Cited by Peters Checklist (multiple locations) to
"Izvestia Imp. Obschestva Liubitelei Estest. Antrop. Etnogr., Moscow, <b>8</b>
pt.2 (1872)"</li>

<li>This work is also frequently cited by a transliteration of the title of the
article, seen as variants of "Vertik. Horiz. Turk."</li>

<li>A copy of the title page of this work (kindly provided by EC Dickinson
2005.01.01) shows that "1872" appears nowhere on the page; "1873" is at foot of
page].</li>

<li>The "1872" may refer to the fact that Severtsov indicated (in Stray Feathers
<b>III</b>:420) that this material was published in Dec. 1872. In 1872, Russia
had not yet adopted the Gregorian Calender (they did so in 1918), so a work would
have to be published on or before Dec. 12, 1872 (o.s.) to be published in 1872
(n.s.). Anything later would have appeared in 1873 (n.s.). I do not believe
Severtsov specifies a particular <b>day</b> in December of "1872"; the ICZN rules
might be interpreted to require the consideration of that (o.s.) date to be "Dec.
31, 1872 (o.s.) which is Jan. 13, 1873.</li>
<li>This logic (if I may glorify it with that term) in addition to the imprint
date of 1873 would suggest that 1873 be regarded as the date of publication. As
to whether it should be considered Jan. 31, 1873, <b>or</b> Dec. 31, 1873 is
another matter. The <b>historical</b> likelihood would strongly favor Jan. 31,
1873; the formal interpretation of the Code might require Dec. 31, 1873.</li>

<pre>
  XL. <i>Iridosornis rufivertex</i>, Lesson, genre
nouveau.
  Le type de ce genre, bien distinct dans
la tribu des tangaras, a ete descrit par M.
Florent Prevost sous l'nom d'<i>arremon ru-
fivertex</i> (<i>Zool. de la Venus</i>, et <i>Revue zool.</i>,
1842, p.335).
  Cet oiseau n'a rien des <i>arremons</i>, ni la
coloration du plumage, ni les charact&eacute;res
du bec, des ailes et de la queue. C'est un 
type net et tranch&eacute;, voison des agl&iuml;a et
conduisont des tangaras aux pie-gri&egrave;ches;
son bec est m&eacute;me exclusivement celui
d'une pie-gr&egrave;che.
 Les charact&eacute;rs de cet petit geure [APP: ?genre] seront:
un bec comprim&eacute; sur les c&ocirc;t&eacute;s convexe, &agrave;
a mandibule sup&eacute;rieure recourb&eacute;e. tr&egrave;s cro-
chure &agrave; la pointe, masqu&eacute; d'une dent forte,
&agrave; bords lisses. La manible inferieure
tr&eacute;s aigue au somment et &eacute;chancr&eacute;e sur les
c&ocirc;t&eacute;s; des soics [APP: ? soies] &agrave; la commissure; narines
enti&eacute;ement cach&eacute;es par des plumes fron-
tales retombantes; ailes atteignant le mi-
lieu de la queue, &agrave; premi&eacute;re penne courte,
les troisi&egrave;me, quatri&egrave;me, cinqui&egrave;me et
sixi&egrave;me &eacute;gales et les plus longues; queue
m&eacute;diocre, arrondie, a pennes l&eacute;g&egrave;rement
acumine&eacute;es aubout; tarses m&eacute;diocres, &agrave;
scutelles peu apparentes; ongles recour-
b&eacute;s, tr&egrave; comprim&eacute;s. Nidification? &oelig;ufs?
M&oelig;urs? plumage &agrave; vive coloration et &agrave; re-
flets m&acute;tallis&eacute;s.
  L'iridosorne &agrave; nuque mordor&eacute;e, mesure
14 centim&egrave;tres. Il a la taille d'un tangara
septicolor. Son bec est noriatre et ses tar-
sis brun-carn&eacute;. Un noir-velours teint le
front, les joues et le con deans son entier.
Ce noir est coup&eacute; par une large plaque
mordor&eacute;e, &agrave; &eacute;clat vif et lustr&eacute;, qui r&egrave;gne
depuis le rebord noir du front jusqu au
haut de cou. Une large ceinture bleue &agrave;
reflets d'indigo traverse le thorax, et ce 
blue s'&eacute;tend sur les c&ocirc;t&eacute;s du corps en se
m&eacute;lant au noir du ventre. Les couvertures
inf&eacute;rieures de la queue sont d'dun rouge
ferruginaux intense. Le manteau et les
&eacute;paules sont de ce m&ecirc;me blue luisant du
thorax. Le bas du dos est noir glac&acute; de
blue. Les ailes et la queue sont noires avec 
du bleu sur les couvertures moyennes et
du bleu sur le bord externe des r&eacute;miges et
des rectrices externes.
  Cet oiseau est de la Bolivie.

the case of plate 434 it seems appropriate to presume that an original text on one side was suppressed and
replaced by a text on two sides showing the earlier livraison number. Now <i>Zoothera 
interpres</i> (Temminck, 1828). <small>[fn: Wrongly dated 1826 by Ripley (1964); here in the context of 1828,

<li>The units of measurement here are of interest.<ul>
	<li>Pouce is a unit of length used in 14<sup>th</sup> to
	18<sup>th</sup> century France.
	Replaced by the metric system during the Revolution.  France,
	however, fairly quickly abandoned the metric system under Napolean,
	reverting (as we see here) to old systems of measurement.
	<b>Pouce</b> is derived from the word for "thumb".</li>
	<li><b>ligne</b> means line and is a watchmaker's measure for the
	thickness of a watch movement.</li>
<li>Pouce = 1.0657 inches, 27.07 mm. 12 pouces = 1 pied-de-roi.</li>
<li>ligne = 2.256 mm; 12 douziemes; that is 12 ligne to a pouce.</li>
	</ul>
<li>S.F. Baird on p.XVI of vol.IX of the Pac.RRReports has a note
reading:<pre>
"The English inch is about equal to 11.26 French lines, .9389 French inches, 
or to 25.40 Millimetres."</pre>
<li>This matches the conversion I found as it indicates 2.256
mm/ligne</li>

<i>Phylloscopus ibericus</i> Ticehurst 1937, its identification and new
evidence of its winter grounds." BBOC <b>121</b>:281-296.</cite></li>
<li>Svensson argues that <i>P. brehmii</i> is a synonym of <i>P. collybita collybita</i>,
and that the correct name for the Iberian Chiffchaff is <i>P. ibericus</i> Ticehurst.
<li>The type for <i>P. ibericus</i> Ticehurst (BM(NH) 1934.1.5045) was
collected near Coimbra, Portugal, 23 May 1920.</li>
<li>Reaching the same conclusion regarding <i>brehmii</i> vs.
<i>iberica</i>, and with more detailed specimen analysis is:
