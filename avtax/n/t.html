<A name="C.torquatusNomenclature" id="C.torquatusNomenclature"></a>
Corvus torquatus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Currently there is disagreement regarding the name for this taxon. 
	Some maintain that Bechstein's use of "<i>Corvus monedula torquata</i>" 
	in 1791 (more probably 1792) makes Lesson's name unavailable.</li>
	<li>This appears to be the position taken by number of authors, including 
	Dickinson, Ek, and Martens (2004) SNAB #44, as well as HBW, but this position appears
	to both oversimplify the situation as well as departing from the requirements of the
	Code.</li>
	<li>Rainer Massmann notes that Bechstein used these names in an infrasubspecific sense
	(describing a number of "Ab&auml;nderungen" (abberations)).
	If this is correct and the Code is to be followed then Article 45.6.1 would hold this
	name to be unavailable.<li>
	<li>Of interest, in the Index Animalium does <b>not</b> list any "<i>torquata</i>" names to 
	Bechstein, as he (Sherborn) may well have regarded this name as infrasubspecific.</li>

Tinamus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<hr>
<A name="A.o.tuftsiCite" id="A.o.tuftsiCite"></a>
Asio otus tuftsi <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This description appears in no.6 of Vol.61, and this is the
	"Nov.-Dec. 1947" number; so 1947 is the date specified.
	<li>The AOU CL 5<sup><small>th</small></sup>:287 dates this to "(Feb. 13, 1948"),	
	but does not state the basis for that dating.</li>
	<li>The BHL scanned copy of this serial shows an accession date stamp of Feb. 17, 1948
	on p.175 of the no.6 (at the bottom of the page it notes that the 
	Sept.-Oct. number was issued 3 Oct. 1947).</li>
	<li>Page 1 of vol.62 however states that No.6 November-December, 1947 was issued
		February 13, 1948.</li>

Tribonyx and Tribonyx montierii <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>These names appear to have been published in two locations in 1840, and I am not certain
		which has priority.</li>
	<li>The "L'Institut." publication is dated to July 30, 1840; and is cited by Shulze <i>et al.</i> for the
	genus name.</li>
	<li>It was also published in the Bull.Roy.Sci. Bruxelle in the number published from the April meeting,
	but I have not been able to determine the date of that number.</li>
	<li>Based on the selection of L'Institut by Schulze <i>et al.</i> I tentatively have selected that source.</li>

<A name="P.taeniopterusNomen" id="P.taeniopterusNomen"></a>
Ploceus taeniopterus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Most workers (CBBM <b>13</b>:467 (= Sharpe 1890); 
	Syst.Av.Aethiop. <b>2</b>:740 (= Sclater,WL 1930); 
	Peters Checklist <b>XV</b>:43 (= Moreau 1962); and H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:721;
	cite this authority as if Reichenbach descrbed the taxon in <b>Ploceus</b>. The basis for
       	this presumption is not given.</li>
	<li>Published works (Meyer, AB,. 1879 Index, and the Richmond Index) indicate that this was
	described in the genus <b>Ploceolus</b> erected by Reichenbach,
	in which he apparently includes <i>Ploceolus taeniopterus</i> .</li>
	<li>I have not examined Reichenbach's Singvogel regarging this matter, but it
	appears Sharpe, Moreau, and Dickinson <i>et al.</i> also have not. I do not believe that 
	Reichenbach described <b>any</b> new taxa in <b>Ploceus</b>, but I may be wrong.</li>
	<li>I note additionally that Eck,S Quaisser C. 2004. "Verzeichnis der Typen der 
	Vogelsammlung des Museums f&uuml;r Tierkunde inden Staatlichen Naturhistorischen
	Sammlung Dresden" Zool.Abhandlungen(Dresen) <b>54</b>:308 in the type list 
	show the original combination as "<i>Ploceus taeniopterus</i>".</li>

Ploceus bicolor tephronotus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:43 (= Moreau 1962) gives the citation as<pre>

	<i>Symplectes tephronotus</i> Reichenow, 1892 Journ.f.Orn. 40 no.198 p.184</pre></li>
	<li>I believe this is incorrect, as the J.Orn. description is in the "Apr" number
	of the J.Orn., and was certainly not likely to have been published before April
		(in fact the likelihood that it was published as early as April is extremely 
		low).
	<li>This name was published in the February number of the 
	Sitz.Allg.Deutsch.Orn.Ges.Berlin. and to date I have no indication that this
      	number was delayed.</li>
	<li>The citation as given by Moreau is the same as given by Sclater,W.L.
	1930 in Systema Avium Aethiopicarum <b>II</b>:730.</li>
	<li>Most probably Moreau's research on this matter consisted of merely copying the 
	citation from Sclater. This possibility is supported by the fact that both Sclater
	and Moreau neglect to include the material on p.219 of the J.Orn. that is relevant.</li>

<A name="C.m.tricolorCite" id="C.m.tricolorCite"></a>
Copsychus malabaricus tricolor <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:70 (= Ripley 1964) gives the citation as<pre>
	<i>Turdus tricolor</i> Vieillot, 1818, Nouv. Dict. Hist. Nat., 
	nouv. &eacute;d., <b>30</b>, p. 291</pre> which on casual inspection apparently
	must be a typographic for <b>20</b> rather than <b>30</b> (which was published in 1819).</li>
	<li>All other generally available, standard sources 
	(<i>e.g.</i> CBBM <b>7</b>:85, Sherborn's Index Animalium p.6590)
	show this as being found in volume <b>XX</b>.</li>
	<li>HBW <b>10</b>:819 replicates the error from Peters Checklist, showing this
		as from volume <b>30</b>.</li>
	<li>It is not clear what sources Ripley checked (the "30" may be merely a typographic error)
	but it seems that in this instance the HBW author's did not look further than Peters 
	Checklist.</li>
	<li>Compounding and extending the problem, H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> Corrigenda 
	4 "corrects" this date to 1819, though offering only "[error in Peters]" as an explanation. 
	Apparently it was not understood exactly <b>what</b> the error was! 
	A date of 1819 would be correct for volume <b>30</b>
	of this work, but I find no evidence that volume <b>30</b> is correct.</li> 
	<li>The Richmond Index also shows this as from vol. <b>XX</b> in 1818.</li>

Turdus grayi tamaulipensis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:220 (= Ripley 1964) gives the year as "1899"
	which makes absolutely no sense for volume 14, of the Auk.</li>
	<li>The correct year for Auk <b>XIV</b>, where this taxon is described is 1897.</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:671, HBW <b>10</b>:668 (2005), 
	Deignan p.439 (1961), and Hellmayr's BirdsAmericas <b>7</b>:377 (1934) have the

<A name="TrogonSystematics" id="TrogonSystematics"></a>
Trogon <strong>Systematics</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A confused and confusing situation here. Recently the AOU CL Committee 
		issued a revision of the Trogons. As is often the case this revision
		is difficult to use as no discussion or treatment of taxa outside the
		AOU CL area is offered. Thus while there is considerable change, 
		many interleaved issues are left undiscussed and uresolved.</li>
		<li>The listing here is a combination of the IOC World Birds list,
		and the AOU CL, as revised in July 2009. It is impossible to fully 
		resolve these two lists.</li>

Gampsorhynchus torquatus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>

	<li>The citation I give differs from that given by the Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:390 (= Deignan 1964).</li>
	<li>Deignan cites  "1874 Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal no.5 p.107", and 
	that may be correct.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index notes both citations, and with regards the Proceedings notes that
	it was "Read May 18th" (I am pretty sure that is what it reads). The Stray Feathers no.4 is the June 1874 number.</li>
	<li>Of course the date when the description was read has no nomenclatural standing, it
	only matters when it was available as a published work.</li>
	<li>It is not clear Deignan's position on this matter (he does not tell us what he knew or what the basis, if any, for his decision was). It is unclear if he took the date "read" as the date of the publication, or if he really worked out the dates of publication of the two works.</li>
	<li>I do not know the date specified for the Proceedings number that contains this and
	find no discussion of this problem in Dickinson &amp; Pittie "Systematic notes on Asian birds. 51 Dates of avian names introduced in early volumes of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal." 2006.</li>

	<li>Mary LeCroy in her Type Specimens of Birds of the American Museum of Natural History Part 5. (2003), published

Corvinella corvina togoensis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>9</b>:341 gives the original combination as
<i>Corvinella corvina togoensis</i> which is incorrect.</li>
<li>Examination of the first and only use of the name on the page of J.Orn.
which Mayr and Greenway cite shows that it is given as <i>Corvinella
affinis togoensis</i>.<li>
<li>It appears unlikely that Mayr (or more probably Greenway) troubled
themselves to actually check the first use of this name. Presumably they
simply copied the error from other authors, whom they did not attribute, and
whom I have not yet identified.</li>
<li>As my own website demonstrates, errors are frequent in nomenclatural
work, but one is motivated to hope that the quality of the systematic
work in volume 9 of the Peters Checklist is different from the quality
of the nomenclatural work found there.</li>

Phasianus colchicus talischensis <strong>Citation</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Conventionally cited to 1888 (<i>e.g.</i> Peters Checklist
<b>2</b>:122 (1934) ; H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:60; HBW <b>2</b>:543 (1994)).</li>
<li>The actual dates of publication of the J.Orn. during this
period are extremely problematic. Delays of between 3 and 9 or more months between the "imprint
date" and the actual date of publication being one of the problems.</li> 
<li>However in this instance there is very good <b>published</b> evidence to support the
interpretation that this name was not published until 1888. The Richmond Index, as well as the
unpublished notes on Dates of Publication point repeatedly to a note in the Ibis 1891:616 where
evidence is published concerning the actual apparent dates of availability for the J.Orn. during
this period. The 1888 Oct. number (184) containing this description was not received at the 
London Zoological Society until Feb. 23, 1889 (virtually a 4 month delay).</li> 
<li>Edward Dickinson (<i>in litt.</i> maintains that the imprint date is the appropriate date to use
according to <b>his</b> interpretation of the Code. (He
relies on the <b>French</b> text of Art. 21.2 French text "est &agrave; adopter comme correcte en
l'absence de preuve du contraire"). The corresponding English text is "is adopted to be correct in
the absence of evidence to the contrary.", so the difference hinges on the distinction between
"evidence" and "preuve" (proof), a difference which encompasses the minor and the profound.</li>
<li>The publishing history of the J.Orn. is vastly rich in <b>evidence</b> of delays and
irregularities, and some of the evidences can be regarded as tantamount to proofs, but most, so far,
are not.</li>

Lichtenstein MS name, and an 1854 use by L. Brehm in Naumannia!. [APP: 2009.10.27 Not correct!!

In summary, at this point it appeared that the Schlegel Abhand. citation was the most frequently cited. Peters
holds this to be 1843, though with no supporting data. 1841 seemed "a good guess" to me for <i>Falco biarmicu
feldeggii</i>, and Hartert's note for that taxon suggests (but does not prove) that those <i>feldeggii</i> plates
<b>followed</b> at least plates 9 and 10. Therefure 1841 may be a reasonable guess for this taxon.</li>
<li>After all that work, I remembered to look in Browning &amp; Monroe (1991):390 where this matter is dealt with
in detail. The conclusion there is that <i>Falco tanypterus</i> was in Heft 2 of the <i>Abhandlungen</i> and that
was published in 1843. The plates (12, 13) were actually issued in 1850.</li>

<li>Quaisser,C and Nicolai,B 2006. "Typusexemplare der Vogelsammlung im Museum Heineanum

	"Heft III:(2), 8, pl.12 (ad.) &amp; pl.13 (fem. juv.)</pre> they do
not appear to discuss the interpretation by Browning &amp; Monroe.</li>

<li>[2009.10.27 Edward Dickenson has examined at least two copies of this work, in London and
in Washington, DC. and feels (as Browning and Monroe did) that the name is cited in 
Heft 2, which appears to be appropriate to date to 1843.</li>

Fringilla teydea <strong>Citation</strong>

evidence in support of that date.</li>
<li>This date is followed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:746 without comment.</li>
<li>The Richmond index dates this to 1836, noting that it occurs in livr.4 (a fact
unrecognized or uncommented on by Mayr) and that livr.1-9 were reviewed in Isis,
1837 where the date is given as 1835.</li>
<li>Zimmer dates this portion of the work to 1841, indicating that references are
made in the work to "publications dated 1840". Zimmer, however makes no mention of
the review in Isis in 1837, so there is much mystery here.</li>
<li>Sherborn in Index Animalium  p.6476 dates this to 1841, with the phrase "(<i>me
judice 1841</i>) -- certainly suggesting there was some uncertainty in his
mind.</li>
<li>In my mind a contest between Richmond and Mayr is trivial, and I would vote with
Richmond without hesitation in such a matter. However, a conflict between Richmond
and Zimmer is much more of a problem. Each presents evidence and data suggesting
they carefully considered the matter. For the moment I follow Richmond. <!-- For the
moment I adopt Richmond's approach, and expect that some energetic worker will
research this issue, find Richmond to be correct and claim the understanding to be

Sporophila telasco <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>13</b>:148 (Paynter) cites this as :<pre>
<i>Pyrrhula telasco</i> Lesson, 1828, Voy. Coquille, Zool., <b>1</b>, livr. 8, pl.15, fig.3;
	<i>idem., op. cit.</i>, 1830, livr.15, p.663</pre></li>
<li>This citation presents a host of errors, confusions, and infelicities: <ol>
	<li>If the taxon is <b>actually</b> on pl.15 the date, and livraison would be correct. However the
	table of plates for this work (kindly provided by Edward Dickinson, 2006.01.22) lists the following
	taxa for pl.15:
	<ol>
	<li><i>Muscicapa chalybeocephalus</i> Garnot</li>
	<li><i>Muscicapa enado</i> Less.</li> 
	<li><i>Muscicapa toi-toi</i> Garn.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>No</b> <i>Pyrrhula telasco</i>! <i>Pyrrhula telasco</i> is listed as the third figure
	on pl.16.</li>

<li>Pl.16 (according to Zimmer p.188) is in livr.9, which was not published until Feb. 28 of 1829.</li>

<li>The Tabular listing of plates and contents for the Voy.Coq. has quite a few irregularities, so perhaps
it is wrong and other sources must be consulted.</li>
<li>CBBM <b>12</b>:102 (Sharpe) suggests that if this <b>is</b> an error, it may have started with him. The
listing there is:<pre>
Pyrrhula telasco <i>Less. Voy. Coquille</i> i p.663, pl.15 fig.3 (1826)</pre>
</li>
<li>As usual, checking the Richmond Index finally produces some clarity. Richmond's card
indicates that this name is first published in Man.Orn. I June, 1828 on p.340. with additional notes that
the Man.Orn. entry 'quotes Zool. Coq. "pl.15,f.3"'. Richmond additionally notes that the bird appears on
"pl.16 fig.3, livr.9 Feb. 1829" as well as on p.663 of the Zoologie published in 1830.</li>
<li>So Lesson (or his editor) appears to have made an error in Man.Orn. listing the bird on the wrong
plate, and this error has been reproduced without question or comment by everyone except Richmond.</li>
<li>On an extremely minor note, I can not help but observe Paynter's use of "<i>idem.</i>" (sic);
<i>idem</i> is a Latin word not an abbreviation. Period-at-end is incorrect, unless it is the final
word in a sentace -- an impossibility here as the period is followed by a comma.</li>
<li>It is of interest that with some other citations in this volume (e.g. <i>Fringilla iliaca</i> p.42) the
text string "[reference not verified]" is included, which would imply that the others <b>have</b> been.  I
don't wish to be ungenerous, but I frankly doubt that very much.</li>
<li>It is fortunate, however that even though the citation is wrong and the understanding of the matter
was flawed, at least the author and the year are correct, nonetheless.</li>
<li>Daria Wingreen of the Cullman Memorial Library confirms (2006.01.26)
that the bird is pictured on pl.16 fig.3 of the Voy.Coq. So, once
again, Peters Checklist, CBBM, and their many followers are wrong,
but Richmond's published data are correct.</li>

by Bonaparte in 1854.</li>
<li>Listed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:158 as "<b><i>Columba torringtoni</i></b>
(Bonaparte, 1854)"</li>
<li>Bonaparte's 1854 description roughly translated says:<pre>
	5. The last species, finally, <i>Col. torringtoni</i>, Layard, is properly
	said, only a race of <i>Pal. elphinstoni</i>, particular to Ceylon ...</pre>

	 <a href="./pic/Col_torr.pdf" target="ref_fr">Bonaparte's Comptes Rendu
	 Description</a></li>

<li>Edward Dickinson brought to my attention the fact that Warren in the 1966
Type Catalogue List for the British Museum notes that Kelaart's initial
description (not seen) appears to have been wrongly ignored.</li>
<li>Kelaart evidently listed this name first on p.107 where the name is a <i>nomen
nudum</i>, and on this basis the name was ignored by many workers. That portion
of the work was published in 1852. However the name was later published
(in ?1853?) with a valid description in <b>Palumbus</b> and with a
terminal <i>-ii</i> ending. That publication occured either in Appendix "C" to
the Prodromus, or in the Jour. Roy. Asiatic Soc., Ceylon Branch <b>11</b> pt.1,
(?or in both?).</li>
<li>The presence of a valid description with the name
<i>Palumbus torringtonii</i> is supported by the Richmond Index, which dates it
to 1853, and lists the valid name as occuring on p.35 of the Appendix.</li>
<li>Of importance in this matter is the work by Pittie and Dickinson 2006. "The
correct name of the Sri Lankan Woodpigeon and the citation for its original
description." BBOC <b>126</b>(3):196-199.
In that paper several points are advanced. In my view the most important and
correct one is the assertion (p.196) that regarding the confusing details of
publication there is "no certainty to be presented".</li>

<li>Pittie and Dickinson maintain that the specific epithet must be
corrected to <i>torringtoniae</i> based on the fact that the name honors Lady
Torrington. Article 31.1.2 states:<pre>
31.1.2. A species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case (see Article
11.9.1.3) formed directly from a modern personal name, is to be formed by adding
to the stem of that name -i if the personal name is that of a man, -orum if of
men or of man (men) and woman (women) together, -ae if of a woman, and -arum if
of women; the stem of such a name is determined by the action of the original
author when forming the genitive.</pre> 
I agree with the interpretation that the name must be rendered
<i>torringtoniae</i>.</li>
<li>They state:<pre>
	The acceptance of 1853, rather than 1854 relies on the minutes of a
committee meeting held on 21 December 1853 (Lamprey, 1855), which record that 'A
letter from Dr. Kelaart was read and laid on the table, stating that he had been
at great expense in publishing, and requesting that the Society would accept
copies of his work in lieu of subscriptions due. It was then moved and agreed
to, that two copies of his publication be recieved, in lieu of all past arrears
of subscriptions due by him to the Society, and that a recommendation be made by
the Committee at teh next General Meeting, that he be made a Corresponding
member of the Society.'</pre>
It must be noted:<ol>
	<li>The 21 December minutes explicitly refer to a <b>letter</b> from Dr.
	Kelaart being read and laid upon the table, and <b>NOT</b> to any copies of
	the work being present (or laid upon the table).</li>
	<li>These minutes reflect the <b>intention</b> of accepting the copies, but
	most emphatically do not indicate physical acceptance of the copies
	themselves. I feel that these minutes:<ul>
		<li>Are <b>not</b> proof of the existence of the work at the time of the
		meeting.</li>
		<li>Actually suggest that it is more probable that the work did
		<b>not</b> exist for distribution at the time the meeting was held.
		Certainly Kelaart's case would have been stronger if he provided
		copies (or a copy) of the work which he proposed be accepted in
		lieu of his "subscriptions due".</li>
		<li>Dating this work and its appendices is a very great challenge. It
		seems that "1852" can not be accpeted as the date for this appendix, so
		the question is should 1853 be accepted. I think the data presented by
		Pittie and Dickonson actually argue more for 1854 than for 1853. I
		employ 1853, swayed by the apparent inclusion of that date on the title
		page (i.e. the "date specified"), but would not be surprised if evidence
		came to light that would establish 1854 as the year in which the
		publication (or the Appendix "C" at least) was first available.</li>
		</ol>

<li> Additionally, Pittie and Dickinson assert that the authority should be to Blyth and Kelaart.
This opinion apparently turns on the wording employed in the original
description:
<pre>"Remarks -- This beautiful pigeon we have named after Lady Torrington..."</pre>
Pittie and Dickinson state in their footnote (#6, p.198)
<pre>"There seems to be no reason to suggest that the 'we' was a 'Royal plural.'"</pre> They
give no support for this assertion, and tell us nothing of the patterns of use of
"I" or "we" in the rest of the work; patterns of use which might make one position or the other
clear.</li>

<li>Further information has become available thanks to D Priyantha Wijesinghe, PhD. who brings forward
several facts that result from his familiarity with this work.
<ul>
<li>Kelaart habitually and frequently used the so-called 'Royal plural. Wijensinghe includes these
examples:<ol> 
<li>In the Prodromus in the latter part of the chapter on 'The Natural History of
Newera-Ellia' (esp. pp. xxiv-xxxiii). On p.xxxii Kelaart writes:
<pre>"But we regret exceedingly that since we left Newera Ellia, we have not been able to gain further
information on the subject. It is to be hoped that some Zoologist will soon visit that interesting
locality and complete the work which we have only begun."</pre></li>
<li>Kelaart ends the chapter (p.xxxiii)
<pre>"Our own labours would, like those of too many collectors, have been a chaotic mess, but for the
assistance of the cabinet investigations of such eminent men as the Grays and Blyths. Would that we had
more opportunities of consulting their works and extending under such auspices, our researches in the
natural history of our native land."</pre></li>
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Thus, I can not agree with the statement of Pittie and Dickinson that
<pre>"There seems to be no reason to suggest that the 'we' was a 'Royal plural.'"</pre>
The use of "we" neither demonstrates nor excludes the possibility of Blyth's inclusion in the
authority, and should, it seems to me, be ignored.</li>
<li>The Code article 50.1.1 reads:
<pre><b>50.1.1.</b> However, if it is clear from the contents that some person other than an author of
the work is alone responsible both for the name or act and for satisfying the criteria of availability
other than actual publication, then that other person is the author of the name or act. If the identity
of that other person is not explicit in the work itself, then the author is deemed to be the person who
publishes the work.</pre>
So is there any indication from the contents of the work that speaks to the responsibility for the
nomenclatural act?
As noted by Wijesinghe the title of Appendix C is as follows:

<pre>Appendix C. Notes and Descriptions of some new or little known species of Ceylon birds: by Ed.
Blyth, Esq. Curator of the Bengal Asiatic Society's Museum. From the Journals of the Asiatic
Society.</pre> [The footnote to this title says: <b>'The "remarks" are mine.-E. F. K.'</b>].
and we have:
<pre>"Remarks -- This beautiful pigeon we have named after Lady Torrington..."</pre>
and this act of naming thus appears to be attributable to "E. F. K." = Kelaart, based on the
contents of the work.</li>


<li>Wijesinghe also notes (<i>in litt.</i> 2007.08.28)
<pre>Regarding the year of publication of Kelaart's Prodromus (including the Appendix pages 1-50), I
think we can fix it at 1853, since Pethiyagoda & Manamendra-Arachchi (1998) refer to a "flyer" issued by
Kelaart in 1853 advertising his book as "just published in one Vol. 8vo cloth; price 10s. 6d."</pre></li>

Tachuris <strong>Nomenclature</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>The gender of this genus group name was in question, and this
prompted a (difficult) search for the text of the original description
of the genus. The results of efforts of many people were summarized in
an email from Normand David (2004.10.14) who writes:<pre>

In &Eacute;cho du monde savant 2, 2<sup>nd</sup> divis., no. 24, Sci. Nat.
et G&eacute;ogr., p.107 (1836),
Lafresnaye wrote (thank you Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois for the transcription):

"...je me crois en droit, non pas de donner un quatri&egrave;me nom
nouveau au Roitelet omnicolor (Dieu me garde de cette manie si fatale
&agrave; la Science !), mais de lui rendre le nom g&eacute;n&eacute;rique
de Tachuris que d'Azzara lui avait impos&eacute;, il y a plus de
trente-cinq ans dans son excellente description, et
de lui laisser le nom d'esp&egrave;ce d'omnicolor de Vieillot, et sous
lequel il est connu si g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement. D&egrave;s lors, le
Tachuris omnicolor devient le type d'un genre dans le groupe assez
nombreux des Fluvicolinae de Swainson, ou
Gobe-mouches riverains, et suivra imm&eacute;diatement les Gobe-mouches
petit coq et Guira yetata..."

Here, Lafresnaye established genus <b>Tachuris</b>, with <i>Regulus
omnicolor</i> Vieillot, 1823 (not <i>Muscicapa regia</i> Lafresnaye ...)
as type species.

All this because I wanted to know the grammatical gender of
<b>Tachuris</b>. It is masculine, and the names now combined with it
(<i>libertatis, alticola, loaensis, rubrigastra</i>) do not change.</pre></li>

divis., no.24, Sci. Nat. et G&eacute;ogr., p. 107</pre></li>
<li>The Richmond Index gives a similar, but slightly different listing as <pre>
L &Eacute;cho du Monde Savant, <b>3<sup><small>e</small></sup> ann&eacute;e,</b>
	{138,
no.	{24		June 12, 1836. p.107 (in text).</pre>
With an additonal handwritten note saying:<pre>
<u>First</u> publ. in Mem. Soc. Acad. de Falaise, at least so Lafr. says in the 
present paper!</pre>.
June 12, 1836 would be a Sunday, which fits the indicated schedule of publication
for this serial.
</li>
<li>Somewhat laborious investigations of this Mem.Soc.Acad.deFalaise indicates that
only one volume was published (for 1835) but this appears to have been published in
1836. So with the results of efforts from Normand David, Steven Gregory, Edward
Dickinson, and Jean Francois Voisin it appears we have established this as a
"red-herring".</li>
<li>Turning to the discrepancies (though minor) between the Peters Citation, and the
listing in the Richmond Index, much confusion results from using "ann&eacute;e" and
volume, and I expect that Traylor used the 3<sup>e</sup> ann&eacute; for the volume
number.</li>

Porzana tabuensis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<li>This name and the identity of this bird is discussed in detail
	by Lysaght. <cite>Lysaght A. 1956. "A note on the Polynesian Black
	or Sooty Rail <i>Prozana nigra</i> (Miller) 1784." BBOC
	<b>76</b>(6):97-98.</cite> Briefly summarized here:
	<ul>
		<li>This bird was discovered at Tahiti and painted by Georg
		Forster on Cook's 1772-1775 voyage. (<cite>Icon. ined.,
		<b>1</b>, pl.130</cite>)</li>
		<li>As Sherborn and Iredale point out (<cite>Sherborn CD,
		Iredale T. 1921 " J.F. Miller's Icones." Ibis.
		<b>3</b>:302-309.</cite>) Forster's plate was copied by J.F.
		Miller and published as no.50 in the 1776-1792 series
		<cite>"Various subjects of Natural History"</cite>, and the
		interleaved text gives the name as <i>Rallus nigra</i> and the
		locality as "Otaheite".</li>
		<li>Latham in 1785 separated the Tabuan from the Tahitian Rail,
		and his accounts were the basis for Gmelin's Latin descriptions
		of <i>Rallus tabuensis</i> and <i>Rallus tahitiensis</i>. </li>
		<li>The second edition of Miller's plates was issued as
		<i>Cimelia Physica</i> and is much more widely known and
		available than the rare first edition. In it the plates are
		accompanyed by descriptions by George Shaw. In this second
		edition the Polynesian Black Rail appeared under the Gmelin
		name <i>Rallus tabuensis</i>. Shaw remarks that the rail was
		discovered when Banks was in the Pacific, a statement almost
		certainly false, but probably arising from the fact that
		Forster's plates were in Bank's possession.</li>
		<li>Miller's name <i>Rallus nigra</i> was ignored until 1921
		when Sherborn and Iredale published their findings regarding the
		dates of Millers plates.</li>
		<li>Sherborn and Iredale determined that Miller's name antedated
		Gmelin's <i>Rallus tabuensis</i>, but were uncertain how
		Miller's bird related to the Henderson Island rail <i>Porzana
		atra</i> North 1908.</li>
		<li>Mathews <cite>Systema Avium Australasianarum 1927.
		p.92</cite> accepted Miller's name as correct for the Polynesian
		Black Rail from Tahiti, Tonga, and Fiji, but treated the birds
		from the last two islands as races.</li>
		<li>Peters Checklist <b>2</b>:188 discusses Miller's plate but
		as Lysaght points out makes some errors:<ol>
			<li>Peters says "No locality", while the locality of
			"Otaheite" is in fact given.</li>
			<li>Peters' representation of the the size "somewhat larger
			than <i>tabuensis</i>" does not correlate with the fact that
			these dimensions are not greater than those given by
			Amadon in the series of skins from the Whitney
			expedition."
			</ol>
		<li>Lysaght concludes: "the very widely distributed species
		about which Amadon has given so many interesting details should
		be known as <i>Porzana nigra</i> (Miller) 1784."</li>

	<li>HBW <b>3</b>:140 (Taylor), increases at least <b>my</b>
	confusion, by referring to a bird "The Tahiti Crake <i>Porzana
	nigra</i>" as being exctinct "post-1784(?)".<br> It is not clear to
	me what bird is referred to here, and the basis for it's being
	considered extinct. The "post-1784" date certainly suggests the
	possibility that they are referring to a Miller taxon. <br>
	Taylor does not reference Lysaght's 1956 work on this name.</li>
	<li>Edward Dickinson, as usual, provides the essential understanding.
	When the Code was adopted, five years after Lysaght's article, the decision was
	taken to limit all forgotten names discovered before 1960 to require 
	referral to the Commission for determination as to whether it should be
	placed in the Official List of accepted names, or in the Official Index of 
	Rejected Names. Thus it appears that Lysaght's excellent and correct work
	was made null and void by an arbitrary date decision of the Commission.</li>

Touit <strong>Nomenclature Gender</strong>
<ul>
<li>Normand David writes (2002.10.25), illuminating the issue of the gender of
<b>Touit</b>.</li>

<li>"<b>Touit</b> Gray, 1855, formed from the Tupi Indian word "tuiete", has the noun
<i>hueti</i> as its only originally included nominal species. When the gender of a name was
neither expressly specified by its author, nor indicated by a combination with adjectival names
of the originally included nominal species, the name is to be treated as masculine, except that,
if it ends in <i>-a</i> the gender is feminine, and if it ends in <i>-um, -on,</i> or <i>-u</i>,
the gender is neuter (ICZN 1999: Art. 30.2.4).</li>

<li>Therefore <b>Touit</b> is masculine and the adjective <i>melanonotus</i> [black-backed]
must agree in gender."</li>

<li>The further implications in the genus as I [APP] see it are:</li>
<ol>
<li><i>Touit batavica</i> (<i>batavica</i> an "Erroneous toponym after Batavia" (Jobling), and
I interpret this to be a latinized word, that must agree in gender) =<i>batavicus</i>.</li>
<li><i>Touit hueti</i> (clearly stands as is).</li>
<li><i>Touit costaricensis</i> (<i>costaricensis</i> would appear to be a latinized
geographical name in masculine form, and should remain as is).</li>
<li><i>Touit dilectissima</i> (orig.<i>Urochroma dilectissima</i>) <i>dilectissimus</i> is a

<strong>description</strong> 
<ul>
<li>The original description reads:
<pre>
86. Motacilla tractrac, the African Whinchat. This
species inhabits the Auteniquis country, perching on
bushes. It is about the size of the European whinchat,
but extremely wild and shy, rarely approaching the haunts
of men; sometimes it may be seen in the cattle-inclo-
sures; but, if a man approach, flies off directly; then you
may discover that the rump is white, as are also the four
lateral tail-feathers, which it spreads much as it flies. It
is called <i>trac-trac</i> becuase it seems to express that syllable
repeatedly in its cry.  In flapping its wing, and shaking
its tail, it resembles the rest of the species.  There is
nothing striking in the plumage. It is cinereous grey on
the head and mantle, lighter on the lower part of the
back, and entirely white on the tail-coverts; the front
of the neck and breast are lightsh grey; the rest of the
under part white. The twelve tail-feathers are black
tipped with white, and of equal length; the first on
each side are edged outwardly with white, the fourth and
third have it only toward the origin; the third, how-
ever, rather more than the fourth; the two last, i.e. the
outermost of all, are white all along. The wing-feathers
are brwon, edged, the first of them with light brown, the
last with white. The bill, legs and feet, are black; the
eye, which is very large, nut-brown; a row of white fea-
thers encircles the eyelids. The bird digs a hole for its
nest at the foot of a dwarf-tree or bush; the eggs are four
in number, greyish, with an infinite number of brown
dots. Though this species be very difficult of approach,
M. Vaillant succeded in killing eight males and five fe-
males. The latter were rather smaller, and the white over 
the vent not so extensive. In the young bird the features
of the mantle are bordered with rufous.

<a id="S.taverni" name="S.taverni"></a> 
<p>Spizella taverni <b>Species or subspecies?</b></p>

<p>The debate here is sharply drawn, and strongly presented on both
sides.</p>

<ul class="noindent">
<li>Mayr E and Johnson N. 2001. The Condor 103(2):418-419. "Is
<i>Spizella taverni</i> a species of a subspecies?"</li>

<li>Klicka J, Zink RM, Barlow JC, McGillivray WB and Doyle TJ.
2001. The Condor 103(2):420-422. "The taxonomic rank of <i>Spizella
taverni</i>: a response to Mayr and Johnson.</li>
</ul>

<p>The debate and its implications are fascinating. The
enthusiastic pursuit of the "species concept" is not over, despite
numerous announcements of its resolution. My own personal view is
unimportant. I think the "phylogenetic species concept" has more
appearance of utility and testability than the "biological species
concept" but I think it suffers from a difficulty that will be not
less problematic than that bedeviling the biological species
concept. Collection of enough data to resolve the full extent of
variability of the population in question will be often
impracticle.</p>

<p>The idea of a species as a "narrative predictor" (which I
believe is due to Robert O'Hara) is a good one to keep in mind.
Both BSC and PSC discussions of <i>S. taverni</i> seem to me to
include consideration of what <b>will</b> happen to the isolated
allopatric population. While I tend to generally favor the
Biological Species Concept, I think the attempt to acheive
"taxonomic balance" is impossible on practical grounds. I also
think that definition of population limits and what degrees and
character of differences are sufficient to constitute a species
will be a challenge for the Phylogenetic Species Concept. Some of
the early characterizations of the Phylogenetic Species Concept
seemed to me poorly thought out, and the defense predominantly by
<i>ad hominem</i> attacks made it seem more religous than
scientific.</p>

<p>I leave <i>Spizella taverni</i> in at full species rank which
would appear to suggest I more swayed by the PSC than the BSC
position here. If this continues I am confidant it will be hard to
keep up with the number (doubling at least) of species that will
soon constitute the AVES.</p>

<p>The PSC approach does seem more appropriate and tractable for
addressing phylogeographic issues.</p>

<a id="B.thoracicusNomenclature"
name="B.thoracicusNomenclature"></a> Bambusicola thoracicus
<strong>Nomenclature</strong> 
<ul class="noindent">
<li>Usually as <i>Bambusicola thoracica</i> (e.g. Peters Checklist
<b>2</b>:106; Sibley &amp; Monroe 17; HBW <b>2</b>:523
(McGowan)).</li>

<li>The gender of <b>Bambusicola</b> (Bamboo dweller) would appear
clearly masculine, due to the masculine suffix <i>-cola</i>.</li>

<li>However, when Gould erected the genus, he used it in
combination with the name <i>sonorivox</i> and <i>vox</i> is a
feminine Latin noun.</li>

<li>Thus, it appeared to me that ICZN 30.1.1 (1999) required the
feminine Latin Medieval <i>thoracica</i>.</li>

<li>Normand David discussed this (<i>in litt.</i> 2002.05.29). He
writes:"A genus-group name that is or ends in a Latin or Greek word
of common or variable gender (masculine or feminine) is to be
treated as masculine unless its author, when establishing the name,
stated that it is feminine or treated it as feminine in combination
with an adjectival species-group name (ICZN 1999: Art. 30.1,
30.1.4.2).</li>
</ul>

<p>Most classical Latin nouns that end in the substantival suffix
<i>-cola</i> [dweller] are masculine, but a few are feminine as
well as masculine [e.g. <i>monticola</i>, <i>limicola</i> (Glare
1982)]. Thus, generic names that end in <i>-cola</i> and that
happen to be classical Latin words of common or variable gender, or
happen to be newly derived words, are not all mandatorily masculine
contrary to what Clancey (1992: 221), Dowsett &amp; Dowsett-Lemaire
(1993: 359), and Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990: 592) have concluded;
they are feminine if originally established in combination with a
feminine adjectival name (Godfrey 1965: Auk 82: 273). For example,
<b>Arundinicola</b> d'Orbigny, 1840, originally established in
combination with the latinized adjective <i>leucocephala</i>, is
feminine and currently treated as such. Therefore:</p>

<p><b>Bambusicola</b> Gould, 1863, was first established in
combination with the noun phrase <i>sonorivox</i>, and is thus
masculine. [The name sonorivox, although ending in a feminine noun,
is not an adjective; it is an invariable noun phrase like
<i>ruficauda</i>]. And the correct combination is <i>Bambusicola
thoracicus</i>. </p>

<a id="TodirhamphusType" name="TodirhamphusType"></a> Todirhamphus
<strong>Type</strong> 
<ul class="noindent">
<li>Peter <b>5</b>:193 lists <b>Todirhamphus</b> in a footnote to
the the synonomy of <b>Halcyon</b> not listing any type species for
it. [He attributes this name (correctly) to Lesson 1827, but Lesson's 1827 name
was spelled <b>Todiramphus</b> not <b>Todirhamphus</b>.]</li>

<li>HBW does not indicate types.</li>

<li>The Richmond index card for <b>Todiramphus</b> Lesson, 1827.
under "Type" lists two species:
<ol>
	<li>'<u>T</u>. sacer "Lesson" (<u>nec</u> Gmel.!)'</li>

	<li>'<u>T</u>. <u>divinus</u> Less.'</li>
</ol></li>

<li>So the problem becomes determining the synonomy of
<i>Todiramphus sacer</i> Lesson, 1827.</li>

<li>Sherborn lists:

<ul>
<li>"<b>sacer</b> Todiramphus (Gm.), R.P. Lesson in Ferussac, Bull.
Sci. XII. 1827, 269. -Alcedo, 1788."</li>

<li>"<b>sacer</b> Todiramphus (Gm.), R.P. Lesson Mem. Soc. H. N.
Paris, III (3) Oct. 1827, 421."</li>
</ul>

<li>Sherborn seems to interpret Lesson's <i>T. sacer</i> to be
synonomous with Gmelin's <i>Alcedo sacer/sacra</i>
which, if true, would make it synonomous with <i>Todirhamphus chloris</i> 
(Peters holds it as the trinomen <i>Halcyon chloris sacra</i> (Gmelin).</li>

<li>Richmond seems to think Lesson's <i>T. sacer</i> is NOT that of Gmelin.</li>

<li>Regarding the second name (<i>divinus</i>) that Richmond lists as a
type, he has a card for that taxon:</li>

<li>At present I am uncertain what the type of <b>Todiramphus</b>

but Richmond's interpretation that Lesson's <i>T. sacer</i> is not
<i>Alcedo sacra</i> Gmelin (a synonym of <i>T. chloris</i>
(Boddaert)) raises a problem, as well as the uncertainty of the
status of <i>T. divinus</i> Lesson.</li>

<li>To quote Dickinson: 'Mees (1994) reported that an "Avis
accompagnant la 97e livraison" was present in the copy of the
"Planches colori&eacute;es" in Leiden and that this carries the
date April 1836. It follows that the dates for livraisons 98 and 99
must also date from 1836, presumably from after April, and thus
from December 31.'</li>

<li>Has been spelt <i>tut<b>a</b></i>. (e.g. Sibley &amp;

<li><cite>David N &amp; Gosselin M. 2002. "Gender agreement of
avian species names." BBOC. <b>122</b>(1):18</cite> indicate that
the name must be spelt <i>tutus</i>.</li>

<li>I interpret this to be based on the Latin adjective
<i>tutus</i>, <i>-a</i>, <i>-um</i> [protected, safe, out of
danger]. Jobling's definition of "revered, regarded" for
<i>tutus</i> seems based more on the relation with the verb
<i>tueri</i> than on the definition given by the Latin dictionaries
available to me.</li>

<li>During the period of 1978-1992 only the combination <i>Halcyon
