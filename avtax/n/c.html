<A id="ChlorostilbonType"</a>
Chlorostilbon <strong>Type species</strong>
<ul>
	<li>There is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the typification of this Genus.</li>
	<li>The AOU CL 6<sup><small>th</small></sup> 1983 and 7<sup><small>th</small></sup> 1998  give 
	"Type, by monotypy, <i>Chlorostilbon prasinus</i> Gould (not of authors) = 
	<i>Trochilus pucherani</i> Bourcier = <i>Ornismya aureo-ventris</i> d'Orbigny and Lafresnaye."</li>
	<li>Then in 2017 we have "The generic classification of the Trochilini (Aves: Trochilidae):Reconciling
		taxonomy with phylogeny" 2017. Stiles,FG; Remsen,JV; &amp; McGuire, JA. Zootaxa <b>4353</b>:401-424,
		where they list (Appendix 1. p.418) the type as "<i>Ornismya prasinus</i> (sic) Lesson, 1830, 
		<i>Hist.Nat.Ois.Mouch.,</i> 188 (=<i>Trochilus mellisuga</i> Linnaeus, 1758, <i>Syst. Nat.,</i>ed. 10, 121	</li><br> 
	<li>Before proceeding to the disagreement, I address one minor detail. </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Lesson's taxon is <i>Ornismya prasin<b><u>a</u></b></i>, not <i>Ornismya prasin<b><u>us</u></b></i> This can be seen here: <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/194632#page/242/mode/1up" target="new">Hist.Nat.Ois-M. p.188</a>. This fact (commonly confused, and indeed confused by Gould) has no effect on the subsequent considerations.</li><br>
		</ul>

	<li>In addressing the matter of the type, the Stiles group appears (to me) to be following the arguments
		of John Todd Zimmer. They cite two papers by Zimmer in the Am.Mus.Novitates, "Studies of
		Peruvian Birds, nos.58 &amp; 59." In the first of these <i>Am.Mus.Novitates</i> 147<u>4</u> (not
		1473, as they list it), Zimmer has a long argument in which he states 
		that Lesson's bird, can in fact be identified as the bird that Linnaeus called
		<i>Trochilus mellisugus</i>. <ul>
			<li>He states (p.5) "I have no hesitation in placing <i>Ornismya
			prasina</i> of Lesson as a synonym of <i>Trochilus mellisugus</i> of Linnaeus..."</li>
			<li>But in my view, assigning the specimen that Lesson called <i>Ornismya prasina</i> to
				<i>Trochilus mellisugus</i> Linnaeus, based on the Linnaeus and Lesson descriptions
				is important only if Gould erected his genus based on that specimen.</li>
			<li>In fact, Gould apparently based his genus on some specimen, that some collector
				<strong>called</strong> <i>Ornismya prasina</i>, apparently a commonly used name
				with unknown relation to Lesson's concept.</li>
		</ul><br>
	<li> Thus the point, apparently missed by Zimmer (!) and the Stiles group, is that the type of
		<b>Chlorostilbon</b> Gould 1853, <b>while intended to be</b> <i>Ornismya prasina</i> Lesson, 
		may or may not have been that species,  but rather Gould simply applied it to a bird 
		"generally known by that term among collectors..." <b>not</b> a bird necessarily
		so named by Lesson. In such a situation the phrase "not of authors", is appropriate.</li>
		
		<!-- Zimmer (again on p.5) argues that Gould "misapplied the
		name to another species, being uncertain as to the precise application...". It appears to me
		that in that case, whaterver that other "species" is, is the type.  This appears to be
		the interpretation of others.</li> --><br>
		<li>Other presentations of the type for <b>Chlorostilbon</b>.
			<ul>
			<li>Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. 1892 <b>16</b>:44 C. pucherani</li>
			<li>Cat.BirdsAm. Cory &amp; Hellmayr <b>2.1</b>:202 <i>Ornismya prasina</i> Lesson</li>
			<li>BirdsMiddleN.AM. Ridgway <b>5</b>:547 <i>Ornismya prasina</i> Lesson</li>
			<li>Peters CL Birds of the World Peters,JL 1945 <b>5</b>:36 <i>Chlorostilbon prasina</i> Gould, not of authors = <i>Trochilus pucherani</i> Bourcier.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>In Gould's Monograph of the Trochilidae, he discusses this bird (p.cx), 
		indicating it was "impossible to determine to what bird Lesson 
		had given the name <i>prasinus</i> (sic)"<br>
	       	He (Gould) applied it to a bird "generally known by 
		that term among collectors..." "From Dr. Cabanis we learn that it has been named 
		<i>Trochilus nitidissimus</i> by Lichtenstein in the Museum of Berlin, 
		and <i>Trochilus lamprus</i>, Natt. in the Museum of Munich ; but had either of these 
		names been published to the world before Dr. Cabanis included it in 
		his 'Museum Heineanum' under the name of <i>Chlorostilbon nitidissimus</i> ? 
		If not, and <i>prasinus</i> be rejected, that term must certainly give 
		place to M. Bourcier's previously published one of <i>Pucherani</i>, 
		which I find, from the type specimen now before me, was given to a young male 
		of this species. Refer to my account of this species, and of <i>C. Atala</i>."</li><br>

		<li>So from Gould's perspective <i>Pucherani</i> was <u>conditionally</u> the type, if
			two conditions are met: <ul><li>1. <i>prasin[a,us]</i> Lesson not being identifiable
					(Gould says it was <b>not</b> identifiable to him)., and</li>	

				<li>2. <i>Trochilus nitidissimus</i> having not been previously published 
					for the bird.</li></ul> 
			<li>Does it now turn on <u>were</u> met <i>vs.</i> <u>are</u> met, and
			does it make Gould's inability to identify whether or not the
			bird was Lesson's <i>Ornismya prasina</i> unimportant?</li>
			</ul>

<A id="CurrucaNomen"</a>
Curruca <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<ul>

	<li> This previously much used genus group name has been resurrected for use in dealing with the deep and multiple splits in the Sylviidae.</li>
	<li>To date (2020.08.17) I have not found any published discussion of the nomenclature involved, and at least I find
		a number of questions.</li>
	<li>First, the name has been used, it seems in a generic sense, <strong>before</strong> its use by Bechstein 1802, which is proposed (without comment)
		as the authority for the name.</li>
	<li>Some uses, <i>e.g.</i> by Koelreuter in 1767, appear to have been held to be non-binomial. I know of no comments on whether Moehring's 1758 use is binomial.
		Naumann in 1797 I vol.1 Heft.5 pl.33 fig.68 may have used it generically, but again I find no comment on this.</li>
	<li>Additionally questions arise regarding the type. Generally this would (I expect) be assumed to be <i>Sylvia curruca</i> Linnaeus 1758, but
		in 1830, Jardine and Selby provide an illustration of <i>Sylvia atricapilla</i> Latham saying it is "typical of the genus".
		Is this typification by subsequent designation?  Probably not, but did anyone ask, or look into it?"</li>	
	<li>If all this has been investigated I am possibly just kicking up dust because I don't find the relevant literature.</li>
	<li>Sherborn's Index Animalium has 85 taxa employing the name <b>Carruca</b> before 1850. A name that has been used in lots of ways by many different people and in
	      many different contexts.	Lots of opportunity for trouble it seems to me.</li>
	<li>No doubt the authors resurrecting this old, old name have done due diligence and investigated all the possible problems that may lurk in the past, and they
		have spared us from reading of their work.</li>

Cinclodes comechingonus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Usually cited to 1944.</li>
	<li>However, as George Sangster points out (<i>Zoological Bibliography</i> <b>6</b> no.11 p.133-134))
		the type was collected in 1945, and the journal documents that this part was published in August 1945.</li>
	<li>Sangster also states that due to this fact, the name "Porphyrula georgica Pereyra" which if found in this
		number should date to 1945. This seems less certain to me.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>I have not seen this volume and number of El Hornero, but wonder if Sangster is referring to Porphyrula georgica (Pereyra)?</li>
		<li>The Richmond Index indicates that Pereyra described  "<i>Ionornis georgica</i>" in the newspaper "Tribuna" in 1943,
			and this was "redescribed as Porphyrula georgica in El Hornero viii, Dec. 1944[sic]"</li>

		<li>It is established, however that Gould's PZS publication (8 April 1836) has priority
			over Temminck's, which occurred in 1836, but with somewhat uncertain date and
			thus dated to 31 Jan. 1836.</li>

Carellina <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Usually cited to Bonaparte 1850.</li>
	<li>Bonaparte in Consp.Gen.Avium p.312 refers to Du Bus de Gisignies work Equiss.Orn. t.34 (and gives a
		date of 1850).</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index has a card indicating that Sclater in 1855 in PZS p.66 says that this plate "unless
	I am very much mistaken, is still unpublished".</li>
	Both the Richmond Index and Sherborn's Index Animalium credit the name to the plate (name and figure alone) with the
	indication that it was published in 1849.</li>
	<li>The work "Equiss.Orn" is dated to 1845-1848 (not 1849). Supporting the possibility that the plate alone
	was subsequently produced (1849), and not surprisingly many, most, or possibly all of the volumes may not
	now have the associated plate.</li>
	<li>It is, of course, possible, that the production of the plate did not meet the criteria for "publication". We know, 
	however, that Bonaparte saw, or was aware of the plate, and Sherborn seems to have found a copy. It further seems unlikely
	(at least to me) that only a single copy of the plate would have been produced.</li>
	<li>My interpretation favors following Sherborn and Richmond with regards to the authority for the name and for its date.</li>.

<li>The ICZN apparently tried to deal with this name in Opinion 784 (Bull. <b>23</b>:201-201 (Dec 20 1966) (not seen 2011.03.15).<br>
There they suppress Jarocki's 1821 use of the name, and hold Bonaparte as the author.
However, in the ICZN listing, they do not cite the earliest generic use of this name by Bonaparte.</li>
<li>The ICZN cites the name to PZS["1837"] 1838 Pt5 no.59 p.111. 
That work was published in 14 June, 1838,
and Bonaparte used the name in combination with a specific epithet in his Geograph.Comp. on p.32.
That work was published 14 April, 1838, and can be seen here:<br>

The description of the species figured on the plates was afterwards undertaken by Audoin (sic),
who, in 1826, published his "Explication Sommaire des Planches d'Oiseaux de l'&Eacute;gypte et
de la Syrie" in Part 4 of Vol. I of the Hist. Nat. of the Description de l'&Eacute;gypte."</pre></li>

<li>A nomenclatural act in the 1826 publication would have priority over the subsequent 1828 
publication cited by Peters and followed by many authors.</li>
<li>It does seem quite clear that Zimmer, Richmond, and Sherborn all understood the situation
better than White, or Sharpe. While uncertainty remains, I follow the use of the presumptively 
1826 citation until that is shown to be wrong.</li>

<li>[2010.03.28] Michael Rieser points out that the Willughby reprint includes an index that
shows this taxon as present on p.281 in the folio edition, and p.380 in the 8vo. edition.</li>
<li>The folio edition is evidently undated (Willughby reprint p.vii), but Newton states (p.vii) that <pre>
it may be presumed to have appeared not earlier than 1826.</pre></li>
<li>These facts support "1826" and certainly indicate that the octavo edition (as cited by Peters)
is not likely to be the publication with priority.</li>

Then in Corrigenda 2.1 changes the date to 1861 (sic), citing Duncan 1937.</li>
<li>This appears to me to be an error. This name was published in Part <b>XVII</b> Part <b>III</b>
(which is comprised of sheets 406-416, pp.353-521). The initial portions of Part <b>XVII</b> were 
published in 1859, and part <b>III</b> was published in February of 1860.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> (including the Corrigenda) cite many taxa from Part <b>XVII</b> Part <b>III</b> to 1860 (<i>e.g.</i> <i>Crypturellus boucardi</i>) so an explanation would

<li>Penhallurick &amp; Robson. 2009 
("The generic taxonomy of parrotbills (Aves, Timalidae)"
Forktail <b>25</b>:137-141) Date this genus name and the included species to 1842, as <pre>
<i>Conostoma</i> Hodgson, 1842 ['1841'],<i>Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal</i> 10:856</pre></li>

<li>Deignan 1964 (Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:431) gives:<pre>
<i>Conostoma</i> Hodgson, 1841 or 1842, Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal <b>10</b>, p. 856</pre></li>
<li>The dating of this volume (<b>X</b> of the J.Asiat.Soc.Bengal) has long 
been a question. Sherborn, in Index Animalium for example, questioned whether 
it may have been published in Jan. 1842. But it is not clear what convinced Penhallurick and Robson that 1842 was correct -- that is, whether evidence of delay for this number (no.119) was found. 
[Note: that Penhallurick and Robson do not indicate the number (no.119) in which this 
genus is erected, though in this particular instance this fact could be important.]</li>
<li>Vaurie 1954 Am.Mus.Novitates 1669 p.10 also dates this to 1841.</li>
<li>Most recently Dickinson &amp; Pittie 2006 "Systematic notes on Asian birds. 51.
Dates of avian names introduced in early volumes of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal" 
discussed this, and explicitly considered the problem of dating the name <b>Conostoma</b> (see p.118).
They present evidence and arguments against this number (no.119) of volume <b>X</b> 
being delayed until 1842.</li>
<li>Past speculation of the <i>possibility</i> of delay into 1842 
is not, in my opinion, sufficient under the Code to accept 1842 as the date.</li>
<li>As the Richmond Index notes this was not published before December, as it
contains a report of the December meeting.

<li>The original combination is <i>Ath[ene] castanotus</i>.</li>
<li>Undoubtedly these errors result from Sharpe's 1875 CBBM <b>2</b>:215 treatment where he gives

<li>This taxon is referred to by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:629 as <i>Z. l. westernensis</i> (Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1930) ["1930" is an error corrected to 1830 in Corrigenda 7].</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:316 (= Mayr 1967) holds this taxon (<i>Dacnis westernensis</i>) 
to be a synonym of <i>Sylvia lateralis</i> Latham.</li>
<li>This basis for holding <i>westernensis</i> to be a valid subspecies of <i>Z. lateralis</i> 
is not clear to me, but may well be in the many notes on <b>Zosterops</b> species in 
H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>.</li>
<li>However, the seniority of the Quoy and Gaimard name appears to be a question, 
and one not addressed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>. The Richmond Index indicates that 
Quoy and Gaimard's name is a synonym of Latham's 1801 [=1802] <i>Certhia caerulescens</i>, 
collected in New South Wales, and
with a type which is "Watling drawing no.110, now in the B.M.".</li>
<li>Thus it appears to me that the Quoy &amp; Gaimard name is a junior subjective synonym
of Latham's name.</li>

<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:92 (=Snow 1967) to Dresser in PZS 1888 ["1887"] p.563, 
and this is followed by HBW <b>12</b>:754.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index indicates that this name was published by Guillemard in Jan. 1888 in Ibis, 
while Dresser's PZS publication of part 4 was almost certainly not until April of 1888. 
Therefore the Ibis publication by Guillemard has priority.</li>
<li>Initially it was my interpretation that Guillemard, thus became the author of the name.</li>
<li>
The Code (1999) states: 50.1.1 "However if it is clear from the contents that some person other 
than an author of the work is alone responsible both for the name or act and for satisfying 
the criteria of availability other then the actual publication, then that other person is 
the author of the name or act."<p> 
Therefore, I interpret Dresser to be the author of the name, 
which clearly was the intention of Guillimard, though such "intent" has no force under the Code.

<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:509 cites this to 1850 (presumably following Peters) but in the
Corrigenda (2.1) says "date 1851 not 1850" with no rationale, justification, or supporting data given. We
are left to speculate on the basis for this assertion, and my best guess is that a determination was made 
that the relevant portion of the PZS was actually published in 1851, but that is entirely speculative.</li>
<li>I try to present a rationale and supporting data for the positions I take. 
In this instance the Richmond Index notes that this name is used by Bonparte on p.382 of the Consp.Gen.Av. volume 1.
So I believe the date of 1850 is correct for this taxon, and it should be cited to the Conspectus, not the PZS.</li>

Dicrurus bracteatus carbonarius <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Those of us who struggle with the twin challenges of getting nomenclature correct and 
editing nomenclatural texts should take heart from the fact that the most renowned published
authors were challenged as well. Volume <b>15</b> of the Peters Checklist has many instructive
examples of editorial lapses and nomenclaturial inconsistencies. Familiarity with the fact that
error and inconsistency in this volume should be expected suggests that the most appropriate
response to these infelicities is silence, never forgetting the difficulty of the task and the
great advances provided by these authors.</li>
<li>The character of the errors prompts one to speculate on how the work flow, and editing
responsibilities were actually carried out.</li>
<li>One example that catches my attention, from a nomenclatural point of view relates to the
treatments of <i>Dicrurus hottentotus carbonarius</i> and <i>Dicrurus hottentotus
densus</i>. In the Peters Checklist these taxa are found on pp.149,150, and both names are from
Bonapartes Consp.Gen.Av. <b>1</b>. A slightly slippery nomeclatureal point is at play here (I
ignore the question as to whether the work should be dated to 1850 or 1851). For both names in
Bonaparte's work, the orthography is the directly comparable. This is a scan of the section in
question:<p>
<img src="./image/cga352.jpg"><p>
As you can see they are <b>printed</b> as <pre>
Edolius <b><i>carbonarius</i></b>
Edolius <b><i>densus</i></b></pre>
Both of these names actually occur in a section (that starts on p.351) headed <b>Dicrourus</b>
and Bonaparte (we interpret) holds all these taxa to be <b>in Dicrourus</b> (the name is simply
a variant of <b>Dicrurus</b>).</li>
<li>Vaurie's treatment leaves one scratching one's head. In the case of <i>Dicrourus
hottentotus carbonarius</i> (p.149) he lists the original combination as "<i>Dicrourus
carbonarius</i>" and does not employ parentheses for the authority. [I believe this treatment
is currently the correct one]. For the <i>densus</i> name he lists (p.150) the original
combination as <i>Edolius densus</i> and puts the authority in parentheses <b><big>!</big></b>.
<li>Two sequential names in what appear to be identical states, one treated one way, the other
in another. Nomenclature is confusing enough without examples such as this.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index indicates that the original is <i>Vireosylva josephae

	target="ref_fr">J.Orn.</a></i> 2 no.7 p.25</li></ul>
<li>However, I learn from Dr Frank Stenheimer (<i>in litt.</i> 2008.01.14)
<pre>The title page of "Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete..." shows that BOTH
"Beitraege" were published in 1852, bound together in one volume including 11
plates. No information is found that they would have been published with a
two year gap inbetween.

However, the first part was also published separately in the tiny and unknown
journal "Verzeichnis der &ouml;ffentlichen und Privat-Vorlesungen, welche am
Hamburgischen Akademischen Gymnasium von Ostern [year] bis Ostern [year]
gehalten werden".

Complete citation: Hartlaub, Gustav (1850): Beitrag zur Ornithologie
Westafrica's. Verzeichniss der &ouml;ffentlichen und Privat-Vorlesungen,
welche am Hamburgischen Akademischen Gymnasium von Ostern ...[probably 1849]
bis Ostern ... [probably 1850]gehalten werden. Schulprogramm, Akademisches
Gymnasium, Hamburg. Pp. 1-56.

Thus, in the year 1850 Gustav Hartlaub had already published there his first
part of the "Beitrag zur Ornithologie Westafrica's". Unfortunately this rare
journal is also not available in the Zoological Institute of Hamburg so that
I have now to trace a copy of this journal.</pre></li>
So this name may well date from 1850 and from this rare source.</li>

<li>A peculiar bibliographic situation exists here. The latter portion of Lawrence's paper
(with the initial segment on pp.359-361) was continued following the "General Index that occurs
at the end of the volume. A footnote at the bottom of the initial page
of the continuation states, "This portion of the paper was inadvertantly left out by the
editor." The pagination is peculiar in that the final page of the "General Index" has page
numbers "428", "429" at the top of the two columns (all other "General Index" pages have only
one page number for the two columns). The  next page (on which the bird description occurs has
no page number imprinted (!), but clearly it should be regarded as the equivalent of "429" as
the following page is numbered "430".</li> 
<li>The note at the top of the "continuation" says: "[Continued from p.359]", though it appears
to me that it would be more correct to say "[Continued from p.361]", as p.359 at bottom is

Psittacula calthropae <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Orignially published as <i>Palaeornis Calthrapae</i> but the
bird was named for Layard's first wife, whose maiden name was Calthrop.
It appears the name was a manuscript name due to Layard, but was published by Blyth.</li>
<li>Sharpe's Hand-List 1900 <b>2</b>:32 has the following note:<pre>
<b>calthorp&aelig;</b> *
...
...
* This is the correct rendering of the name. It was dedicated by Mr. E.L. Layard
to his first wife, who was a Miss Calthorp.  He told me this himself, remarking that
he had himself inadvertantly perpetuated the error, through a misprint in his 'Birds
of South Africa,' where he intended to call a Pipit <i>Anthus calthorp&aelig;</i>, but for the
second time his printer failed him, and it appeared as <i>calthrop&aelig;</i>.</pre>

	I find no evidence of this pipit name.</li>

<li>Sherborn Index Animalium 1924 p.1006 has an entry for<pre>
<b>calthropae</b> Psittacus, E. L. Layard, Journ. Ceylon Br. R. Asiat. Soc. [II (5) 1849-50]
	1850, 75  ; ed. 2, 1890, 200.</pre>
	which appears to be junior to the Blyth publication, in a different publication, and with a different
	spelling!!.</li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:246 errs in the belief that the bird was named for
a Miss Calthorp. In this, he cites, and is following the error in Sharpe's Hand-List 1900 <b>2</b>:32</li>

<li>Dickinson <i>et al.</i> write (H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:[828]):<pre>
The <i>lapsus</i> by Blyth was emended in or before Salvadori (1891); this taxon was named for a Miss
Calthrop and not as Peters (1937) wrote a Miss Calthorp. Use of this accurate emendation from 1891 
to 1937, has been succeeded by over 50 years of use of <i>calthorpae</i>. Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990)
resurrected <i>calthropae</i>, but we judge that <i>calthorpae</i> must benefit from the rules on 
prevailing usage.</pre>
</li>

<li>The definition of "prevailing usage" from the glossary of the ICZN 1999 is as follows:<pre>
<b>usage</b>, <b>prevailing</b>, <i>n.</i>
    Of a name: that usage of the name which is adopted by at least a substantial majority of
    the most recent authors concerned with the relevant taxon, irrespective of how long ago
    their work was published.</pre>

<li>So, in my view, a demonstration of "prevailing usage" must publish the results of a study showing what
universe of data was examined, why that universe of data is sufficient and appropriate to answer
the question of frequency of use by different authors, and show that the
data demonstrate a <b>substantial</b> majority (<i>i.e.</i> number) of authors used a particular
rendering of a name. The argument must include logic in support of the fact that the "majority"
is a <b>substantial</b> majority, and not just a simple majority.<br>
The discussion by Dickinson <i>et al.</i> does not indicte the range of publications and authors
consisdered, it does not demonstrate (or even
<b>mention</b>) a majority, let alone a "substantial majority" of authors, nor does it indicate criteria
for deciding which authors were "concerned with the taxon" (whatever <b>that</b> means). The
argument in support of "prevailing usage" appears to be based upon the recent <b>duration</b> of
use, while the definition requires establishing a <b>frequency</b> of use (substantial majority
of authors concerned with the taxon). It may well <b>be</b> that the proposed prevailing
usage can be demonstrated, but in my view, it must be published and the component criteria
must be presented with supporting logic and arguments. Until such a time I interpret it to
be incompatible with the Code 1999 to use <i>calthorpae</i>.</li>

<li>The representations in the Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. <b>20</b>:461-462 are of some interest. We have:
<pre>15. <b>Pal&aelig;ornis calthrop&aelig;</b> [main heading]
	Pal&aelig;ornis calthrap&aelig; <i>Blyth</i> 1849
		[with 9 additional entries from 6 authors following]
	Pal&aelig;ornis calthrop&aelig; <i>Kelaart</i> 1852
		[with approx. 26 additional entries from 18 authors following]
	Pal&aelig;ornis calthrapa <i>Bp.</i> 1857
	Pal&aelig;ornis calthropi&aelig; <i>Schlegel</i> 1864</pre>
Obviously, this sketch must not be interpreted to be any evalution of the "most recent authors
concerned with this taxon", but I include it here for interest.

Lophornis chalybeus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>A very complicated situation here. At issue are the following:<ol> 
	<li>the spelling of the specific epithet</li> 
	<li>the author of the name</li> 
	<li>the place where the name first occurs</li>
	<li>the date of publication.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Conventionally (e.g. Peters Checklist <b>5</b>:32) cited as <ul>
	<li>Trochilus chalybeus <a href="../../bio/biov.html#Vieillot" target="ref_fr">Vieillot</a> 1822 <i><a
	href="../../cit/jourt.html#Tabl.Encyc.Meth.Orn." target="ref_fr">Tabl.Encyc.Meth.Orn.</a></i> 2 p.574</li>
	</ul>
	I say "conventionally", however it must be noted that it is common to misread the Peters Citation and to
	wrongly interpret his date as 1823. In fact he has 1823 as the imprint date with a <b>published</b> date
	of 1822.</li>
	<li>The Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. <b>16</b>:426 begins the citation thus:<pre>
	Trochilus chalyb&aelig;us, <i>Vieill. Enc. M&eacute;th.</i> p.574; <i>Temm. Pl. Col.</i> 66.
		f.2; <i>Gray Hand-l. B.</i> i. p.147</pre>
		Salvin thus appears to believe the name is due to Vieillot and that it is spelled with a ligature
		(-&aelig;-).</li>
	<li>The evidence (which is moderately complex) initially suggested that the spelling
	<i>chalyb&aelig;us</i> may have been used on the wrappers to livr.11, though the name on the plate is
	rendered <i>chalybeus</i>.</li>
	<li>There does seem to be an exellent structure of data and arguments that the Pl.Col. livr. 11 (June
	1821) publication, in whatever form, antedates the Tabl.Meth. publication where Vieillot is often held to
	be the author. Examples of the wrapper for livr. 11 have been actively sought for over a century but
	it is not clear if they can be found, or will resolve all of the uncertainties.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index lists the name as <i>Trochilus chalybeus</i> and gives the authority to Temminck
	(with "Vieill." -- suggeting that it is a manuscript name of Vieillot's), and dates it to June of
	1821.</li>
	<li>Edward Dickinson provides more details on this matter (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.10.21); relevant portions
	of his communication are:<pre>
	Contrary to what I wrote before Temminck did NOT use <i>chalyb&aelig;us</i> on the wrapper. Froriep
	gave <i>chalybeus</i> and so did the Belgian reviewer in the Annales G&eacute;n&eacute;rales des Sci.
	Phys.  
	
	So <i>chalyb&aelig;us</i> is only in the Tableau M&eacute;thodique, which as you recall is an
	    index, binding plan and link between the Buffon plates and the T&amp;L plates.
 
    ... you remind[] me about the Swiss reports on Temminck &amp; Laugier. I do have the set of
	these and I attach a PDF showing the list of the 6 notes that appeared in vols. 4 and 5. These take us up
	to the end of Pl. 120 and thus to the end of the livraisons that appeared before their text did. And thus
	yes, it is possible to cross check Froriep against this source, which I seem to have done but do not seem
	to have entered into a comparative spreadsheet. I have also copied for you the page that deals with
	livraison 11 and you will see that the Swiss review also gives the spelling as <i>chalybeus</i>. So we
	have 3/3 votes for that.
 
    For the record, ... the details that I have for these sources -- not quite complete as to dates -- are as
    follows:
 
    Froriep in <u>Notizen aus dem Gebiete der Natur- unf Heilkunde</u>:
 
    	a) 1821 in an issue dated Julius 1821 and numbered PRO 2: 
    		cols 19-22 include an overview and the details of livraisons I to VIII all of which can only be
    		from the wrappers
 
    	b) 1822 in an issue dated Oktober 1822 and numbered Pro 53 as well as (Nr. 9 des III Bandes): 
    		cols 129-132 include the details of Livraisons IX to XXIII and certainly for the last three (at
    		least) Froreip must have been able to see text as well as plates. In the Introductory paragraph of
    		text Froreip wrote "Dies Werk geht uunterbrochen fort. Auch ist der Bunsch nach einem
    		beschreibenden Texte; den wir den wir Notizen Nr. 2 pag. 21 ausserten, ets f&uuml;llt worden, uns
    		seit dem 20sten Heft jedesmal der Text beigef&uuml;gt; der zu denfr&uuml;hern Heften
    		geh&ouml;rige wird nachgeholt." <!--[By copy of this to Christiane I would ask her to kindly
	translate this for us] -->.
 
    Anon. in the <u>Annales G&eacute;n&eacute;rales des Sci. Phys.</u> (<u>Bruxelles</u>)
 
    a) In Vol.7 pp.361-371: an extensive review which includes the details of the first 6 livraisons. The
	details most probably came from the wrappers (comparison with Froriep might reveal differences but I have

<li>The actual dates of publication of the J.Orn. during this period are extremely problematic. 
Delays of between 3 and 9 or more months between the "imprint date" and the actual date of
publication being one of the problems.</li>
<li>However in this instance there is very good <b>published</b> evidence to support the
interpretation that this name was not published until 1888. The Richmond Index, as well as the
unpublished notes on Dates of Publication point repeatedly to a note in the Ibis 1891:616 where
evidence is published concerning the actual apparent dates of availability for the J.Orn. during
this period. The 1887 July. number (179) containing this description was not recieved at the
London Zoological Society until March 5, 1888 (virtually a 5 month delay).</li>
<li>Edward Dickinson (<i>in litt.</i> maintains that 1887 remains the appropriate date to use
according to <b>his</b> interpretation of the Code. (He relies on the French text of Art. 21.2
French text "est &agrave; adopter comme correcte en l'absence de preuve du contraire"). The
corresponding English text is "is adopted to be correct in the absence of evidence to the
contrary.", so the difference hinges on the distinction between "evidence" and "preuve" (proof), a
difference which encompasses the minor and the profound.</li>
<li>The publishing history of the J.Orn. is vastly rich in <b>evidence</b> of delays and
irregularities, and some of the evidences can be regarded as tantamount to proofs, but most, so far,
are not.</li>

<li>Spelled by Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):416 "<i>Falco Cuvieri</i>" (note -i).</li>
<li>I expect that this follows (without additional examination) Sharpe. Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus.
1874 <b>1</b>:400 where the name is listed with an "-i" ending.</li>
<li>Sharpe in CBBM <b>1</b> may well have been following Gray's Hand-List of Birds <b>I</b>:20 where it is

<li>My facsimile collection of Smith's works (Willoughby Society, 1880) shows the name clearly as<pre>

<li>The listing in the Richmond Index spells the name with the <i>-ii</i> ending.</li>
<li>The single -i spelling seems to be commonly, but not universally, met with. Wolters (1975) in Die
Vogelarten der Erde p.78 spells the name <i>Falco cuvierii</i>.</li>
<li>Similarly, Sherborn in Index Animalium p.1712 (a work that was certainly readily available to the authors
of the Peters Checklist) spells the name <i>cuvierii</i>.</li>
<li>HBW <b>2</b>:268 lists the name correctly as <i>Falco cuvierii</i>.</li>
<li>Edward Dickinson informs me (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.08.03) that the first edition of Peters Checklist (1931)

Phaethon lepturus catesbyi <strong>Citation date</strong>
<ul>
<li>Usually cited to 1838 (<i>e.g.</i> Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):159), and this appears to be conventionally
followed.</li>
<li>The entry in the Richmond Index clearly and strongly shows a 9 overwriting the final "8" in 1838. So Richmond
dates this to 1839, not 1838.</li>
<li>Dates for this early Russian Serial are problematic. Sherborn in his listing for this name, includes the
<b>M&eacute;m</b>.Acad.Imp.Sci. St. Petersburg which Peters shows as an 1840 version of the description published earlier
in the Bulletin.</li>
<li>Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. <b>26</b>:450-459 has a number of entries of interest. For <i>Pha&euml;thon catesbyi</i> (p.457) only
the 1840 M&eacute;m. of the St. Petersb. Academy is listed.	Yet the listing for  <i>Pha&euml;thon flavirostris</i> (p.454)
cites "<i>Bull.Acad. St. P&eacute;tersb.</i> ii p.349 (1837)" so some study of the Bulletin occured in developing these
names.</li>
<li>The AOU CL 5<sup>th</sup> (1957):27 lists the Bulletin and dates it to 1838.</li>
<li>HBW <b>1</b>(1992):289 (J. Orta) dates this taxon to 1840 Bulletin with a citation that appears to be a strange
combination of data from various sources. I am confused enough by this early Russian periodical that I can not say
<b>anything</b> is necessarily wrong, but the HBW citaion (p.[631]) doesn't fit easily with any of the other
citations I have examined.</li>
<li>For this taxon, 1838 certainly appears possible. The collation of data for the Bulletin suggests a good measure of
confusion simply regarding the orderly nomenclature of the publication (even ignoring the problem of establishing the
exact date). See the entry for <i><a href="../../../cit/jourb.html#Bull.Sci.Acad.Imp.Sci.St.Petersb."
target="ref_fr">Bull.Sci.Acad.Imp.Sci.St.Petersb.</a></i> for some details in this regard.</li>
<li>From my perspective, in the abscence of very little in the way of definite data, the choice is between the
convention , or reliablity. I choose the latter (<i>i.e.</i> CWR).</li>
<li>It must also be noted that Mathews has written on the matter of this name (Mathews. 1915. Auk <b>32</b>(2):195-197).
Mathews takes what seems to me to be a high-handed, and imperious attitude in his article. Consistent with much of his
work, his data are incomplete, there is at least one typographic problem (perhaps not his fault), and the clarity of his
position is not what it might be. The citation he gives for Brandt's use of the name does not appear to be the earliest
one available.</li>

Jardine's correspondence she determines that this work was published in Dec. 1842.</li>
<li>I am unaware of any reason not to believe her interpretation, which appears to have been
universally ignored by the ornithological community.</li>
<li>Iredale also published on this work (Iredale. 1951. "'<i>The Naturalist's Library</i>: an Essay in Bibliography.'
Australian Zoologist <b>11</b>:322-332.) and Edward Dickinson kindly provided me a copy to study. It is clear that
uncertainty remains as to whether this volume was published in Dec. 1842, or in 1843. Possible explanations can be
provided for either case. The appearance (but not the certainty) is that Sheets-Pyenson may have dated this based on
information in the Jardine correspondence (which was material unknown to Iredale), and Sheets-Pyenson was fully aware of
and relied partly Iredale's work when she published her paper. For the present time I am employing the dating she
published on p.72 of her work.</li>

Accipiter cirrocephalus <strong>Nomenclature Spelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>It appears that this was originally spelled <i>Sparvius cirrocephalus</i>
 based on The Richmond Index, Sherborn's Index Animalium (p.1327), and
Strickland's 1855 Onrithological Synonyms (p.111).</li>

<li>It further appears (based on Sherborn) that GR Gray emended the name to
<i>cirrhocephalus</i> in 1848 in his List. Birds Coll. B.M. p.???</li>

<li>Sharpe used the spelling <i>cirrhocephalus</i> in Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus.
<b>I</b>:141 (without comment), and this then appears to have been followed by many
modern workers (e.g. Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):339 (Amadon) and H&amp;M
3<sup>rd</sup>:107).</li>
<li>However, it must be noted that HBW <b>2</b>(1994):157 employs the original
spelling <i>cirrocephalus</i>.</li>
<li>Without having examined Gray's 1848 work (which I presume is the original
emendation) I can not be certain exactly what he has done there and why. It is
my confidant guess that it is an unjustified emendation. If this is so, then the
question becomes whether <i>cirrhocephalus</i> is in "prevailing usage". Unless and
until either the emendation is demonstrated to be justified or there is
<b>published</b> evidence that the spelling <i>cirrhocephalus</i> entirely satisfies
all the requirements of "prevaling usage" I will employ the original spelling.</li>

		</li>
<li>Of interest, of a number of taxa from this source checked in the Richmond Index,
one (<b>Neophema</b>) is dated "1891?".</li>
<li>Based on the data Zimmer quotes from Ibis, I dated all taxa from this source to
1891. Other interpretations are, however possible. If multiple copies not
"accessible" to the public were distributed (say at the Museum) during 1891,
then the publication date would be 1891 so this date is based on <b>speculation</b>.
Arguments can be made for either date.
"Completion" is not the same as publication, and this approach argues for using 1892.
My general approach has been in controversial issues to default to following the
Richmond Index, which here would also appear to favor 1891. However <b>published</b>
material including <b>specific</b> details (<i>i.e.</i> The Ibis note) appeared to
support 1892.</li>
<li>Additional reflection prompted me to change back to 1891, based on the
distinction between "accessibil[ity] to the public" and "publication". That is 
material may be published, yet not "accesible to the public".</li>
<li>Who knows, I may change my mind again.</li>

Chionis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>An unusual situation here, where the genus group name is published
prior to the scientific description of any of the component species.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>2</b>:308 comments that J.R. Forster has <pre>
Diagnosis only, no species included.</pre></li>
<li>The first species described, and subsequently included in the genus is
<i>Vaginalis alba</i> Gmelin 1789. A name based on Latham's work.
Essentially all that Gmelin did was assign binomina and Latin descriptions
to birds that were described (without Latin binomina) by Latham. Thus it
is my speculation that Forster was able to write a diagnosis for
<b>Chionis</b> based on Latham's description and illustration and lacking
only a Latin binomen. The binomen was subsequently supplied by
Gmelin.</li>

an additional clue. no.LXVIII for this volume is listed by Duncan as including
pp.93-110, and being published in November. Page 140 is listed as occuring in

Coragyps <strong>Author</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Cat.B.Br.Mus. <b>1</b>:23 gives Bonaparte 1854 as the author of
this name.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):275 gives Isadore Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire in Le Maout 1853 as the author.</li>
<li>HBW <b>2</b>:39 gives the author as Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.</li>
<li>In a series of letters from CWR to Witmer Stone in 1914 Richmond
indicates his finding with regard to the authority and citation for
this name. This appears to have been in response to a request from Stone
to clarify this situation.  CWR after initially tracking down the
later uses of the name by Gray finally recognizes the use by Le
Maout of a Isadore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire manuscript name.
Undoubtedly Richmond's finding was therefore responsible for the
correct citation given in the 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. of the AOU
Checklist (1931). Despite Richmond's satisfactory resolution of the
problem, the subsequent quality and correctness of the citation
progressively degraded at the hands of Wetmore, Friedmann, Amadon,
and Peters. It remains incorrect in the most recent (1999)
7<sup>th</sup> edition of the AOU CL.</li>
<li>It must be recognized that this progressive decline continued until
1998 when Steven Gregory <cite>"The correct citation of <i>Coragyps</i>
(Cathartinae) and <i>Ardeotis</i> (Otididae)." BBOC
<b>118</b>(2):126-127.</cite> re-established the correct citation as
determined by Richmond. Gregory was able to sort this out, without the
advantage of knowing of Richmond's work on this problem, and must be
congratulated for recognizing a truth that escaped others, despite
<b>their</b> ready access to the work Richmond had done.</li>

<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup> Corrigenda 3.1 takes the position that the authority is
Swainson in Vigors, and dates it to 1825. The basis for this assertion is given as
ICZN decision <b>67</b>.</li>

<li>The Official Lists and Indexes of Names and Works in Zoology. 1987. p.71
lists: <pre>
<b>Colaptes</b> Swainson, 1825, <i>in</i> Vigors, <i>Trans. linn. Soc. London</i>
<b>14</b>(3): 457 (gender: masculine) (type species, by monotypy
:<b>Cuclus auratus</b> Linnaeus, 1758, <i>Syst. Nat.</i> (ed. 10) <b>1</b>:
112) (Aves) 0.67</pre></li>

<li>This Official 1987 act by the ICZN seems to be largely ignored, and see below for
excellent reasons to do this. The AOU CL 7<sup>th</sup>Ed. (1998) p.343 lists Vigors
as the author, as does HBW <b>7</b>:510 (2002).</li> 

<li>The 1825 Vigors citation, which the ICZN chose as the basis for this
genus is of interest. The Richmond Index card for this includes the
following notes (quotes are Richmond's).<pre>
"This group forms the genus <u>Colaptes</u> of Mr. Swainson."
(this is the only "orig. diag." given by Vigors</pre>
(The parentheses are unclosed in the original.)</li>

<li>The type is apparently indicated as <i>Cuclus auratus</i> Linn. by
monotypy, so what constitutes the "group" is not clear, not having seen
the paper.</li>

<li>Swainson's role in this nomenclatural act appears to me, at least, to
be minimal and well below that which should afford him status as the
author of the genus. Richmond lists the name Colaptes as a "[Swainson
MS.]" name.</li>

<li>Roy McDiarmid kindly provided a copy of text of Opinion 67 (Smith.Ins.
Publ. no.2409. April, 1916). This constitutes 102 bird names placed in the
Official List of Generic names. In this list, the name <b>Colaptes</b> is
listed as follows.<pre>
<i>Colaptes</i> (Swainson MS.) Vigors, Trans. Linn. Soc. Lond., 14, iii, 1825, 457.
	Mt., <i>Cuculus auratus</i> Linn.</pre>
The author of this taxon is clearly held by Opinion 67 to be Vigors, and not
Swainson, and while it may be interesting, it is useless to speculate on the basis
for this error. However, error it is, and one now enshrined in the "Official
Lists...". From my point of view the intention of this part of Opinion 67, while
extremely clear to me, escaped the understanding of the authors of the 1987 "Official
List....". I follow the original intention and action of Opinion 67 and list the
author as Vigors.</li>

Pseudelaenia leucopodia cinereifrons <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul> 
<li>The Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:26 (Traylor) lists the volume number as
"<b>15</b> no.362" this is inconsistent with his orthographic representation of
this work, which he represents as <b>15</b>(362) on p.70 of the same volume of
the Checklist.</li>
<li>A comparison of other citations to this
serial makes the combination of no.362 and vol.15 appear unlikely, and this
peculiarity would appear to be explained by the note in the Richmond Index for this
taxon. That note has "XV" scratched out and "XIV" written in above it. The note (in
CWR's hand) says <pre> misprinted vol. "XV" on this no.!</pre></li> 
<li>Another taxon from this same volume and number is <i>Sclerurus salvini</i>,
which Jim Peters
lists (<b>7</b>:152) as from vol.<b>14</b> no.362. The Richmond Index for this taxon
has the same note concering the misprinted volume number for this number. It appears
to me that Traylor was unwilling, unable, or disinclined to make his citation
consistent with others either of his own or elsewhere in the Peters Checklist
Series. I fight my own battles with unwillingness, inability, and disinclination, and know
that it is not an easy fight.</li>

	target="ref_fr">PZS</a>(1849)</i> Pt17 no.198 p.143 pl.11</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:231 includes a note that says:<pre>
"The description may have first appeared in Compt. Rend. Acad. Sci. 
Paris, <b>30</b>, Feb., 1850, p.135."</pre>
<li>The dates of publication of the PZS number are uncertain -- listed by
Duncan and CWR as "Ja-Je" for 1850. This number (6) of the Compt.Rend. is
for the S&eacute;ance du Lundi 11 F&eacute;vrier 1850.</li>
<li>It is my guess that this number of the Compt.Rend. was published
before the no.198 of the PZS. My logic here is that no.198 of the PZS is
the fifth number of this volume of the PZS that is designated as occuring
in the "Jan. - June" period. Thus, it appears likely that it may have been
later than the middle of Feb. It is not impossible that the PZS
publication appeared earlier.</li>
<li>I do not know what (if any) imprint dates may be on this number of the
PZS, or on the wrappers in which it was delivered.</li>
<li>It also is of interest that Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:231 lists the
plate in the PZS as "pl.11". The Richmond Index lists the plate in the PZS
as <pre>Aves, pl."X".</pre> The implication of the quotation marks around
the plate number are not immediately clear to me, but suggest the
possibility that it is incorrectly numbered.</li>
<li>HBW <b>4</b>:[611] lists the PZS citation, including the page number
but not the plate.</li>

<li>Most workers are apparently unaware of and thus do not reference Bonaparte's use
of <i>Eclectus cornalia</i> in Athenaeum no.1155, Dec. 15, 1849 p.1277, but according
to the Richmond Index the name there is a <i>nomen nudum</i>.</li>

<li>The exact correct citation is still a bit of a mystery. The citation I give
here is from the Richmond Index, though Richmond has a note that the Lesson 1847

<li>AOU 7th ed. CL uses <strong> chrysomelaena</strong>, referencing Deignan, 1961.
<li>Normand David gives an excellent discussion of nomenclature here (<i>in litt.</i>), and I quote him:<pre>
"Note that AOU 1998 uses <i>chrysomel<b>as</b></i> (p. xlviii), and <i>chrysomel<b>aena</b></i> (p. 571).

Remember that the original name is <i>Tachyphonus chrysomelas</i> Sclater & Salvin, 1869.

[I (APP) had previously included this comment]
<i>Chrysothlypis chrysomelaena</i> spelling:

Usually given as <i>chrysomelas</i>. AOU 7th ed. CL uses <i>chrysomelaena</i>,
referencing Deignan, 1961. In that work, <cite>Type Specimens of Birds In the
United States National Museum p.588</cite>, Deignan makes this argument. 'Since
Hellmayr (loc. cit.) has listed this form as <i>Chrysothlypis chrysomelas
chrysomelas</i>, it follows that he must have considered the generic name
<b>Chrysothlypis</b> masculine. All other names ending with <i>-thlypis</i>, however have
been consistently treated, by himself and others, as feminine (cf.
<b>Geothlypis</b>, <b>Chamaethlypis</b>, and <b>Euthlypis</b>), and <b>Chrysothlypis</b> must therefore
also be feminine.'

[N David continues]
Names ending in <i>-thlypis</i> are not feminine because they are combined with
feminine adjectival name; they are feminine because they end in a
transliterated Greek feminine word [ICZN 1960 30 (a) (ii)]. The rule still
prevails in ICZN (1999, Art. 30.1.2). This means that an original name such
as "<i>Chrysothlypis albus</i>" would need a mandatory correction (= <i>C. alba</i>). In
this case, an author's belief is ignored by the Code.

[Deignan's note continues]
'If this be granted, we must use a latinized form of the feminine ending of
the Greek adjective meaning "black." A comparable case is <i>Turdus protomelas</i>
Cabanis, 1867, which, placed by Seebohm in the genus <b>Merula</b> became <i>Merula
protomelaena</i> (see Catalogue of the birds in the British Museum 5: 265,
1881).'

[N. David's final comment]
In 1960, the rule governing gender agreement of species-group names was not
explicit; in fact, it held in two lines: "an adjective must agree in gender
with the generic name with which it is at any time combined". The 1985 and
1999 Codes, however, are very explicit: an original species-group that is
or ends in a word that is not Latin or latinized must be treated as
indeclinable. Thus, all original names ending in <i>-melas</i> [from melas (black)
in Greek) are invariable, even if <i>melas</i> is an adjective. The rationale
behind this rule is that Latin is the language of scientific nomenclature;
species-group names that are or end in foreign words (neither Latin nor
latinized) cannot have their ending changed as Latin or latinized adjectives."

Ara <strong>chloropterus spelling </strong>
<ul>
<li>In Handbook of Birds of the World, Vol. 4, N.J. Collar argues that the
specific epithet here should be spelt <i> chloroptera</i> stating:<pre>
Original spelling has been taken as evidence that the name was created as 
a masculine noun: however, [it is] at least as likely to be a <i>lapsus
calumi</i> (sic), and long-standing feminine ending should thus be
retained.</pre>

(I have yet to decide if the self-reflexive <i>lapsus calamis</i>
strengthens or weakens this argument.)</li>

<li>Use in various recent works <ol>

	<li>Peters Checklist Vol.3 (1936) p.182 list the bird as <i>Ara
	chloropter<b>a</b></i> and lists the citation to Grey's name <i>Ara
	chloropter<b>us</b></i>. No comment on spelling is made.</li>

	<li>Wolter's Die Vogelarten Die Erde (1975-82) lists <i>Ara
	chrloroptera</i> with no comment on spelling.</li>

	<li>The 6th AOU checklist (1983) is the first AOU CL to list the bird
	and gives the name as <i>Ara chloropter<b>a</b></i>, and erroneously
	lists the name as being <i>Ara chloropter<b>a</b></i> in Gray's
	original description.</li>

	<li>Sibley and Monroe (1990) indicate a belief that the name was formed
	as "a noun in apposition and thus should retain the
	masculine ending." (p. 123). </li>

	<li>The 7th AOU checklist (1998) lists the bird as <i>Ara
	chloropter<b>us</b></i> in its main listing, and (correctly) in the
	citation. No comment is made on spelling.</li>
	</ol>

<li><i>chloropter<b>us</b></i> is ,without question, the original
<b>spelling</b>, in Gray's description.</li>

<li><b>Ara</b> is a Lacepede genus and the name is formed from a Tupi
(Brazilian) word.  <i>chloropterus</i> comes from the Greek <i>khloros</i>,
green or yellow, and <i>-pteros</i>, winged. This appears to me to be an
adjectival construction, so I have trouble seeing the "noun in apposition"
argument as having much force.</li>

<li>I prefer to retain the original (and remain consistent with the AOU
checklist) and thus I adopt <i>chloropterus</i>.</li>
<li>In my view, more evidence than speculative supposition would increase
my enthusiasm for altering the original.</li>
<li>And I must also comment that what we presume is the quest for
"stability" of nomenclature, in this instance seems to result in unending
change.</li>

</ul>
Thanks to Norbert Bahr for bringing this to my attention.<p>
More thanks yet to Normand David for pointing out the problem here.<br>	
His comments (slightly edited) are:<br>

All mannikins are treated in <b>Lonchura</b> Sykes 1832, which has
priority over all other genera.<br>

Except that <i>nana</i> is maintained in <b>Lemuresthes</b> Wolters, 1949, a replacement
name for <b>Lepidopygia</b> (see Peters XIV: 369-370).<p>

But now <b>Spermestes</b> is lumped into <b>Lonchura</b>, and <i>cucullata</i> is the type
species of <b>Spermestes</b>, now called <i>Lonchura cucullata</i>.<p>

Then I think that it is not possible to use <b>Spermestes</b> as a distinct genus
from <b>Lonchura</b> for only <i>caniceps</i> Reichenow, 1879, when <i>cucullata</i> -the type
species- is not included.<p>

If <i>caniceps</i> alone is not placed in <b>Lonchura</b>, then the correct name would be
<i>Odontospiza caniceps</i> (Reichenow, 1879) because <i>caniceps</i> is the type species
of <b>Odontospiza</b>  -see Peters XIV: 368.<p>
[End of N. David's comment]<p>
All this makes sense to me, suggesting <b>Spermestes</b> can not stand as the genus 
group name.<p>

transliterated Greek noun <i>Xen</i> (goose), which is masculine as well as feminine. 

A genus-group name that is or ends in a word of common or variable gender

when establishing the name, stated that it is feminine or treated it as 
feminine in combination with an adjectival species group name (ICZN 1999, Art. 30.1.4.2).

Because all four names were established in combination with a feminine
adjectival name (<i>Chen hyperborea</i>, <i>Neochen jubata</i>, <i>Alopochen aegyptiaca</i>,
<i>Cyanochen cyanoptera</i>), they are all feminine.

Comparisons of Mitochondrial DNA Differentiation in Birds." The Condor. 97(3):650-662.
</cite></li>
<li>The relevant paragraph states.<p>

"Our<i> Larus canus </i>sample represented the subspecies <i>kamtschatschensis</i>
(Russia) and<i> brachyrhyncus</i> (U.S.), which are separated only by the Bering
Sea.
<i>Larus c. kamtschatschensis</i> is a larger and heavier-billed form than
North American <i>brachyrhynchus </i>, and slightly darker dorsally, especially in
juvenile plumage; tail patterns differ in first basic plumages
(Cramp and Simmons, 1983).  The mtDNA data suggest that two species are
represented, a possibility also raised by Sibley and Monroe (1990).
previous molecular studies revealed little differentiation over a large area
in a gull species (e.g. Bell 1992). Although gulls tend to wander, there
are no North American records of <i>L. c. kamtschatschensis</i>. The species
level mtDNA differentiation of p=0.02 was consistent with the morphological
differentiation of the east Siberian form."</li>

<li>They did <b>NOT</b> look at the nominate subspecies <i>Larus canus
canus</i>, and did
not address the issue of intergradation as raised by Sibley and Monroe.

<li>To date I do not find the argument totally convincing for a separation
of species. I expect the argument will be made convincing with more
data.</li>

<li>Vigors originally published it as <i>I. chyanaogast<b>ra</b></i>.<p>
Normand David writes (2001.03.10):<br>
The genus name <b>Irena</b> is feminine, being the latinized Greek word
<i>Eirene</i> with a feminine Latin ending (ICZN 1999, Art. 30.1.3). The
original name <i>Irena cyanogastra</i> Vigors, 1831, must remain as is, and
should not be changed to "<i>I. cyanogaster</i>". The full explication is
very complicated; it is part of a long paper now submitted to the BBOC, and
accepted. Will be published in late 2001 or early 2002. In short:
<i>cyanogastra</i> is the feminine form of the latinized Greek adjectival
word <i>kuanogastros</i> [blue-bellied].

Malaconotus cruentus <strong>Citation </strong>

href="../../../cit/jourc.html#Cent.Zool." target="ref_fr">Cent.Zool.</a></i>
p.198 pl.65</li></ul>

As is typical for the Peters Checklist, it is not clear if there was any
knowledge of the questions and uncertainties surrounding the various
possibilities here. This postion by Rand, which is either an "illusion of
certainty" or simple ignorance, is followed without
comment by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:457.</li>
<li>This citation by Rand may be simply following the citation given by
W.L.Sclater in Systema Avium Aethiopicarum <b>II</b>:637.</li>

<li>It seems that 1830, as proposed by Rand, can't be right based on other
entries from Cent.Zool. which suggest it is 1831, or 1832. This in turn
raises the question of which publication has priority.</li> 

<li>Both the Richmond Index, and Sherborn give:<ul>
<li><i>Vanga cruenta</i> R.P. Lesson <u>in</u> C.Belanger, Voy. Indes
Orient. (4) Zoologie Aug. 1832 p.256.</li></ul>
<li>CW Richmond published an article on the dates of publication of
Belanger demonstrating that livr.4 must have appeared in 1831. The dates of
appearance of the Cent.Zool. are somewhat uncertain, but Sherborn dates
pp.196-200 to May of 1832, which appears to suggest that the Belanger
publication has priority, and probably appeared in 1831.</li>
<li>The listing as given by Rand would appear to me to need published
justification, as would the date as presented by H&amp;M
3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:457.</li>

based on the work of Vous 1977. Ibis 119:376-406. The separation was based on its being the largest
bunting, with the least distinct plumage. It differs from other <b>Emberiza</b> in a having a 
curved tomia to the bill, having a complete post-juvenile molt, and being sexually dimorphic
in size, but not color. <p>
However,
<li>skeletal analysis failed to support a separation from <b>Emberiza</b> (Webster &amp; Webster. 1999. Auk 116: 1054-1074).
<li>Studies of the mitochondrial control region DNA-sequences also fail to support separation from

Corn Bunting <i>Milaria calandra</i> based on mitochondrial control-region DNA sequences." Ibis. 143 p.299-303).<p>
Therefore, until further work is available, I place <i>calandra</i> back in <b>Emberiza</b>. Though it must
be noted that <b>Emberiza</b> is characterized by Webster &amp; Webster as "amorphous and unwieldy". More 
revisions can be expected.

	In this state of virtuous zeal the name that had been explicitly intended by Temminck is swept aside

Cisticola gender <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<li>Many specific names were formed, or used with the understandable expectation that the gender of <b>Cisticola</b> was feminine.
<li>The ICZN rules are clear: ( ICZN, 1999 p.34)<br />
<li>"30.1.1 a genus-group name that is or ends in a Latin word takes the gender
given for that word in standard Latin dictionaries; if it is a compound word
fromed from two or more components, the gender is given by the final component
(in the case of a noun, the gender of that noun; in the case of any other component, sucha as
a Latin suffix, the gender appropriate to that component);"
<li>In this case the component in question is <i>-cola</i>.
<li> The Oxford Latin Dictionary (Glare, ed.) 1982 p.349 gives:<br />
	"<b>-cola</b> ~ae, <i>m. suff.</i> From COLO + A; denotes one who inhabits, tills, or worships."
