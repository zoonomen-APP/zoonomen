Tephrodornis virgatus verneyi <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The collector of this specimen was Arthur S. Vernay (note the ..ay ending).</li>
	<li>The subspecific epithet is misspelt, which should allow correction <strong>however</strong>
		the collector's name is also misspelt in the text. So it seems we are stuck with 
		the incorrect spelling.</li>

Cinnyricinclus leucogaster verreauxi <strong>Authority</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Usually attributed to Barboza du Bocage. This undoubtedly started with
		CBBM <b>XIII</b>:123 (1890), and has been followed since (<i>e.g.</i> Peters <b>XV</b>:99 (1962) [= Amadon].</li>
	<li>The original description by Hartlaub and Finsch was based on a 
		specimen that Bocage sent them, Following the name the article
		has the string "(<i>in litt.</i>).</li>
	<li>The description and measurements provided show no indication of being
		Bocage's, and presumably he only proposed the name "verreauxi"
		in the text of his letter.</li>
	<li>We cannot be certain what else Bocage's letter contained though it
		seems extremely unlikely that the descriptive text (in German, and
		<b>not</b> surrounded by quotation marks) is due to Bocage.</li>
	<li>Laurent Raty's interpretation (as provided by Martin Schneider) is as follows:<p>
		"So far as I understand from the OD, the bird was found in Benguela by Anchieta, who sent specimen(s) to the Lisbon Museum; from there, Bocage then forwarded 'a nice male' to Finsch and/or Hartlaub for comparison with their own material.
		Presumably the name travelled to Germany with this specimen, in an accompanying letter (and/or possibly written on the specimen label). If the Germans had a specimen, they certainly had the necessary material to write their own description; the published description is not in quotes, or attributed explicitly to Bocage; this description does not appear to differ significantly in style from the other descriptions of the work; it is written in German; it describes only the male and gives a single set of measurements (in German units), which are presumably those of the bird sent to Germany. In all likelihood, this description was authored by F&amp;H."</p>
	<li>My interpretation fully agrees with this, and I believe that the name suggested by Bocage is a manuscript
		name, and the description is due to Finsch and Hartlaub giving 
		them the authority for the name.</li>

	<li>Thanks to Laurent Raty and Martin Schneider for recognizing this point which had been overlooked for
		so long by so many workers.</li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:198,199 (= Ripley 1964) incorrectly lists the

<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:666 (Corrigenda 2.1) (presumably from 2002) changes
this date to 1870, citing "[RJD in prep.]".</li>
<li>The dates of this serial are a problem. My work to date continues to support 1869,
and in my communications with Bob Dowsett (RJD) on this matter (2003 thru 2005) 
he has not referred to any publication that resolves the uncertainty.</li>
<li>Absent a published and convincing demonstration that 1870 is correct, I
consider no.8 (the December 1869 number) to have actually been published in 1869.</li>

date taxa from later in this work (<i>Cyanerpes caeruleus longirostris</i> Mus.Hein. 1 p.96; 
H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:814) to 1850 without comment.</li>
<li>Uncertainties exist regarding the date of publication of the first portions of this work,
but I currently follow the Browning &amp; Monroe recommendation to date vol.1, through p.106

<li>Whatever dating approach is used, it seems to me that some attempt should be made
to apply it consistently, and some rationale or support should be given.</li>

Mellisuga minima vielloti <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the Richmond Index, Shaw consistently misspells Vieillot's
name as "Viellot" throughout the volume.</li>
<li>Understandably, the specific epithet is often emended to "vieilloti", and
the justification of that emandation is the subject of dispute.</li>
<li>In my view, special judgments and divination of "original intent" are
avoided by simply employing the spelling used by the author of the name.</li>

<hr><A name="P.c.vanikorensisCite"> Pachycephala caledonica vanikorensis
<strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li> The Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:29 (= Mayr 1967) dating of this taxon is
problematic. The citation is given as:<pre>
<i>P.(achycephala) vanikorensis</i> Oustalet, 1877, Bull. Soc.
Philom. Paris, ser. 6, <b>11</b> (1875), p. 95</pre>
This is reasonably interpreted as meaning that the imprint date is "1875" but
the material was not published until 1877.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):334 subsequently (= Stresemann & Amadon
1979) dates <i>Astur Sharpei</i> from a <strong>later</strong> number
(Bull.Socl.Philomath.  Paris s&eacute;r. 6, <b>12</b> p.25) to 1875!!!</li>

<li>Mayr, presents no evidence for delay of the this publication, but it
seems reasonable to infer that "1875" is the imprint date.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index lists this taxon with 1875 in the citation line (but
does not place "1875" in the line with the taxon name, as he usually does
when he appears to be confident of the date).</li>

<li>Most workers give the date for this taxon as "1878" without note, comment
or evidence in support of delayed publication.</li>
<li>Unless and until evidence for delay of this publication is brought
forward (though it may indeed very well be the case) I will use 1875.</li>
<li>It appears that s&eacute;r 6 was published in 13 volumes from 1864-1876
(presumably the imprint dates?) so a delay until 1878 for volume 11 seems
most unlikely (but not impossible).</li>
<li>In addtion I note that this Society did not maintain consistency
with regards to its name, which was<ol>
<li>"Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philomatique de Paris" from 1788-1796</li>
<li>"Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philomathique de Paris" from 1796-1808</li>
<li>"Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philomatique de Paris" from 1808-1852, and</li>

Emberiza affinis vulpecula <strong>Citation</strong>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>13</b>:24 (Paynter) cites the authority to Grote.</li>
<li>Most probably the Peters Checklist authors are here following Sclater Syst.Aeth. 2 p.829, and

<li>Other authors (e.g.  H&M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:779) no doubt felt no motivation to
question the Peters Checklist.</li>
<li>However, other citations from nearby portions of this work are all cited to Stresemann, and

<li>The Richmond Index (a more reliabel than the Peters Checklist) cites the
authority for this taxon to Stresemann.</li>
<li>Edward Dickinson examined the article an question, he felt that within the description of <i>vulpecula</i> itself 
that no reference was made to Grote. However, the section in which this description is included appears
to be take from a Grote manuscript, so the authority may well be "Grote <i>in</i> Stresemann".</li>

<li>The Richmond Index includes that citation (noting it was published in Apr. 1830) but lists the

<li>Apparently this point was understood by the authors and editors of H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup> as the

<li>Of interest, Richmond's note for this name in the Richmond Index indicates that
he felt the name was a <i>nomen nudum</i> in the PZS location that I cite. Whether this

description of this bird.</li>
<li>The date given by H&M 3<sup>rd</sup>:426, and thus presumably
by extension Schodde &amp; Mason 1999, is "1865". This raises the
possibility that they are citing a source other than the PZS 1862 citation
which Richmond interpreted to be a <i>nomen nudum</i>. Someone with access
to the Schodde &amp; Mason material might be able to answer what, if any,
citation they refer to; it is not material available to me.</li>

<ul>
<li>The situation on the taxon-name and concept here appears to me to be a bit sketchy.</li>
<li>The citation as given here follows that in the AOU CL 5<sup>th</sup>Ed. p.348, as well as
that given by the type record from the U.S.Natl.Museum.</li>
<li>The card in the Richmond Index gives the same citation, but with some interesting features.
following the citation it says:<pre>
[no descr.; mentioned in text under <u>C. richardsonii</u>.] [=<u>C. richardsonii</u>.]

"Prof. Baird has always, to me, <u>verbis et literis</u>, indicated his decided 
conviction that there are two species in the collection; and we have been 
in the habit of designating these gray specimens as <u>Contopus Veliei</u>, after 
Dr. Velie, who sent the first example from the mountains of Colorado 
Territory."</pre><ul>
(quotes in original).</li><p>
<li>Who was being quoted here was not initially clear to me,
but I suspected that it is Coues. (based on
the fancy phrasing "<u>verbis et literis</u>" and the unusual
Coues-like syntax.) Roy McDiarmid copied the original
description for me, confirming that it is Coues. (see below).
<li>Note also, that the borders of the Colorado Territory 
(established in 1861 from portions of the Nebraska, Kansas,
Utah, and New Mexico Territories) had the same boundaries
as the current state of Colorado. Coues (or whoever is
being quoted) may have been referring to a general region,
rather than to the specifically defined geopolitical entity
-- The Colorado Territory.</li>
</ul>
<li>Deignan. 1961. Type Specimens of the U.S. National Museum. p.282 notes:<pre>
The number of cotypes is unknown, and most of them are probably no
longer in the collection; even Dr. Velie's "first example from the mountains
of Colorado Territory" is not now to be found in Washington.  No. 36938 
is a lectotype, chosen by Coues, at Richmond's prompting, long after publication
of the name. It should be mentioned that Phillips and Parkes (<i>op. cit</i>., p.245) 
consider Dr. Velie's lost specimen to be the only possible type.</pre></li>
<li>So it was not clear (to me at least) if an adequate description has been
published.</li>
<li><i>Tyrannula richardsonii</i> Swainson is held by Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:130
to be a synonym of <i>Sayornis phoebe</i>. In this Traylor is following Phillips and Parkes
1955, Condor, <b>57</b>:244.</li>
<li>Phillips and Parkes article argues that Swainson's <i>Tyrannula richardsoni</i> taken in June at
Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, is in fact a <b>Sayornis</b> rather than a <b>Contopus</b>, and that
Baird's and Coues' interpretation that Swainson's bird was a juvenile is unsupportable given the
measurements, state of moult, and location.</li>
<li>They state: <pre>
The availability of the name <i>veliei</i> Coues has been another moot point in <b>Contopus</b>
nomenclature. The name was rejected by its author, but he described its basis; thus it is 
not a <i>nomen nudum</i>, and we consider it to be available under the International Rules 
and Opinion 4.  We do not concur, however, in Fort Whipple, Arizona, as the type locality. 
Coues characteristically ranged far afield in his paper on birds of Fort Whipple and Arizona, 
as has already been noted at one point by Swarth (Pac. Coast Avif., <b>10</b>, 1914:28). 
From Coues's account, one can not be sure that he had <i>any</i> Arizona specimen 
that he would have considered to be <i>veliei</i>.</pre>

<li>Coues' original description (p.61) is as follows<pre> 
64. <big>C</big>ONTOPUS <big>R</big>ICHARDSONII (Swains.) Baird.
...
...
In examining the very large series of skins I have collected on the Rio
Grande in New Mexico, and in Arizona, together with specimens from Colorado
Territory and other parts of the west, there has been made upon me an im-
pression that there are two species.  By far the majority of specimens are of
the regulation <i>Richardsonii</i> type.  A few others in the series and from very
various and diverse localities, differ in being all over of a more decided and
uniform grayish brown; with less of olive above and with no trace below of 
any sulphury olive on the abdomen; this part with the throat being more
decidedly dull whitish than the rest of the series; and the breast more purely
gray, in contrast to the lighter colored throat and abdomen.  The bird may be
well described as a miniature of <i>C. borealis</i>  Prof. Baird has always, to me
<i>verbis et literis</i> indicated his decided conviction that there are two species in
the collection; and we have been in the habit of designating these gray speci-
mens as <i>Contopus Veliei</i>, after Dr. Velie, who sent the first examples from the
mountains of Colorado Territory.  But the proportions of the birds appear the
same in every specimen; and I have noticed, too, that all these gray ones are
late summer or fall birds, and I must candidly confess my inability to 
satisfactorily discern in the series a second species.</pre></li>

<li>So it seems to me we have the peculiar situation of a taxon described by an
author who did not believe the entity was identifiable. Additionally it is not 
clear to me that the name is in fact associated with a designated type specimen,
Richmond's admonition to Coues notwithstanding. Overall a very peculiar situation.</li>

<pre> The authority for the name of this form has been given variously by different authors.  The
paper comprising the original description was undoubtedly written by Jules and Edouard Verreaux,
although they cite Bourcier as authority fo the name, probaby from the label of the type. They
appear as authors of the paper also in the list of contents as the end of the number of the Revue
in which it appeared, but in the index to the entire volume, Bourcier is given as the author of
the paper and the name. In Mulsant and Verreaux's &#147;Histoire naturelle des oiseaux-mouches&#148;
(vol. 3 p.221) Bourcier is cited as authority for the name, but on page 229, in a bibliography 
of papers by J. and E. Verreaux, the title of the original article again appears. Although there 
is no doubt that Bourcier planned to honor Edouard Verreaux by naming this bird for him, I see 
no way he can be credited even as part author since he had no connection with the original
publication.</pre>

This was reviewed in "Ibis" 1882: 602, where the 8 new taxa are
named. All these taxa are from suitable localities, visited by Emin, in
Uganda and Sudan. No volume number is given in "Ibis".

Of the above, those marked &sect; are repeated in Hartlaub G. 1882.

??-?? [not seen critically by me] -- according to the review in "Ibis"
1883: 103 (where date given as July 1882). According to that review, the
J. Orn. paper describes just one bird as new:
<i>Francolinus sephaena ochrogaster</i> Hartlaub 1882, J. Orn. <b>30</b>: 327.

Hartlaub also published:
Hartlaub G. 1882. Zweiter Beitrag zur Ornithologie der
&ouml;stlich aequatorialen Gebiete Afrikas. Abh. Naturw. Ver. Bremen <b>8</b>(1882):184-232. 
It is clear from the "Ibis" review (1883: 214-5) that this is a summary of the previous
publications, with just one new taxon:
<i>Cisticola chiniana ladoensis</i> Hartlaub 1882, Abh. Naturw. Ver. Bremen <b>8</b>:189.
I have also seen quoted for 
<i>Francolinus sephaena ochrogaster</i> Hartlaub, Beitr. Abh. Naturw. Ver. Bremen <b>8</b>:218
-- another example of the Bremen publication being a later summary.
Whether this last is 1882 or 1883, I think we can assume it is
<i>post</i> the other two publications (for which the dates of June and
July 1882 respectively given by CWR would suit me fine!)

My interpretation of the Data presented in Dickinson 2004 suggests that the date of 1849 (as shown

This name is published in the "Supplemental Note" (which is in JASB <b>18</b>:805) which Dickinson 
correctly interprets as having been published <b>before</b> the Catalogue. Dating the publication 
of the Catalogue is problematic, with "proofs" in circulation prior to 1852. But it appears to me

I address here [the] issue: <i>v-nigrum</i> (-<i>nigram</i>, -<i>nigra</i>). 
In short: I think that a Bonaparte's name (<i>v-nigrum</i>) has priority over Gray&acute;s names. 
Most of the information comes from Murray Bruce.

Last fall, I  wrote what follows to Dick Banks:

_____________________________ N. David to RCBAnks, 11/14/02

Dick

AOU 1998 Check-list (p. 78) gives in Notes under <i>Somateria mollissima</i>: "<i>S. v-nigrum</i> Gray, 1856".

Please note that Bruce and McAllan 1990 (<cite>Some problems in vertebrate
nomenclature. II. Birds. Part 1.
Bull. Mus.  reg.  Sci. nat. Torino 8 (2): 453-485</cite>) list the following original combinations:

a) <i>Somateria V-nigrum</i> Bonaparte, C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris 41: 655, 22 October 1855 
b) <i>S[omateria] V. nigram</i> Gray, The Athenaeum, 1 December 1855 
c) <i>Somateria V. nigrum</i> Gray, The Literary Gazette, 22 December 1855 
d) <i>Somateria V-nigra</i> Gray, PZSL, 5 February 1856

It is apparent that Gray's communication at a meeting of the Zool. Soc. of London on 27 November 1855 
was reported in three different British journals or newpapers (with three different spellings). 
However Bonaparte had obtained details of the new taxon from Gray during a visit at the British 
Museum and published the name before Gray. Cramp (1977) Vol I (p. 595) lists the taxon as 
"<i>v-nigrum</i> Bonaparte 1855".

I have not seen Bonaparte's original text, I don't know if his name is available or valid, 
I have not checked synonymies, and I don't know if somebody ever commented on the case. 
I merely want to bring it to your attention. But the use of Bonaparte's name solves the problem 
of Gray's spellings!

The 1999 Code Examples under Art. 31.2.1 gives "<i>m-nigrum</i>" as an invariable noun 
in apposition with the understanding that <i>nigrum</i> agrees in gender with the neuter letter <i>m</i> 
(not with the genus). 
Art. 32.5.2.4.3 prescribes that an hyphen is conserved between a letter and a second element
(when the letter denotes descriptively a character).

Now must Gray's original "<i>v-nigra</i>" or "<i>v-nigram</i>" be corrected to <i>v-nigrum</i>? 
I am not absolutely sure because I do not see in the Code an article that says so clearly and 
explicitely. This is why Bonaparte's name solves the problem.

Yours ____________________________________


Additional comments: 
1) I suspect (and this is only a guess) that Bonaparte hastened to find a type specimen 
(see below) that matched what Gray showed to him. 
2) Can we use the Glossary of the Code (under "noun phrase, p.112) to correct an original 
"<i>femurrubra</i>" to <i>femurrubrum</i>, or an original "<i>v-nigra</i>" to <i>v-nigrum</i>? 
In this case, the question becomes irrelevant if Bonaparte's <i>v-nigrum</i>, which is correctly 
formed according to the Examples under Art. 31.2.1 and the Glossary, has priority. 
Remember that Examples are <b>not</b> part of the Code rules, but that the Glossary <b>is</b>. 
3) The only avian name constructed like <i>femurrubrum</i> that I am aware of is <i>respublica</i> 
(where <i>publica</i> agrees in gender with <i>res</i>).

Dick Banks replied as follows:

___________________________ Date: Fri, 15 Nov 2002 09:44:55 -0500 
From: "Richard Banks"
To: Normand David  Cc: Alan Peterson
Subject: Re: v-nigram /v-nigra /v-nigrum Mime-Version: 1.0

Normand--Thank you for the information on <i>Somateria v-nigrum</i>. 
I have not yet found that particular paper by Bonaparte but I suspect that the name is available. 
The card in the Richmond file lists a type locality and a type, "immature, in collection of 
M. Hardy of Dieppe." It gives the date of the publication as "not earlier than Oct. 22." 
Type locality is "propre aux contrees les plus boreales de l'Amerique."

There is also a card for <i>Somateria v. nigram</i> Gray, with the date Dec. 1, 1855 (Athenaeum), 
and one for <i>v-nigra</i> Gray, Proceedings, 5 Feb. 1856. 
Gray's type locality is Kotzebue Sound, and the second card mentions a specimen in the BM collection.

It looks as though <i>V-nigrum</i> Bonaparte 1855 has priority, and if <i>v</i> is neuter, it is a noun.

I think I will not make a change for the check-list right away. 
There must be some reason that Gray has been cited so consistently. I'll have to try to find out.

But the 5th edition of the Check-list gives <i>v-nigra</i> Bonaparte 1855, with his type locality 
equated to Kotzebue Sound.
So, between 1957 and 1998, Gray gained the advantage over Bonaparte. 
Perhaps following the revised part 1 of Peters, but who knows?

I am copying this to Alan Peterson and to Dan Gibson.

Regards--Dick

<li>David and Gosselin. "<i>Gender agreement of avian species
names.</i>" BBOC 2002. <b>122</b>(1):40 discuss this.</li>

<li>"The final component <i>cyanus</i> is the latinized Greek noun
<big>&kappa;&upsilon;&alpha;&lambda;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</big>
[kuanos: a blue substance, a blue stone, a blue bird]. The
adjectival form would have been <i>viridicyaneus</i> (Latin) or
<i>chlorocyaneus</i> (latinized from Greek)."</li>

<li>They indicate the spelling should be <i>Cyanolyca
viridicyanus</i>.</li>
