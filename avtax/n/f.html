Phalacrocorax auritus floridanus <strong>Citation</strong>

<A name="R.flammigerusNomenclature"  id="R.flammigerusNomenclature"></a>
Ramphocelus flammigerus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The original protonym is spelled with a single -m (<i>flamigerus</i>). 
	This fact is recognized by few including Bonaparte (Consp.Gen.Av. p.242) and 
	Richmond in his Index. Even Sherborn is in error on this name, spelling it <i>flammigerus</i>.</li>
	<li>Understandably most authors appear to have been simply following the Cat.Birds.Br.Mus. <b>11</b>:170,177 (Sclater), and Gray,GR.  Sclater spelled the name with two -m's in his PZS papers 1855, 1856, and Gray apparently spelled it with two -m's in his Genera of Birds.</li>
	<li>It is unclear, and unimportant, if this change was "justified" in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, but we must ask what we are to do now?</li>
	<li>The ICZN Code currently maintains (Art. 32.5) that if the word is a 
		misspelled Latin word, it must be corrected; however, if the word
		is incorrectly Latinized or incorrectly transliterated it must remain
		as original composed.</li>
	<li>In this instance, then, I interpret the original "<i>flamigerus</i>" to be
		an incorrectly spelled Latin word, and correction to "<i>flammigerus</i>"
		is mandated.</li>
	<li>Howard &amp; Moore 4<sup>th</sup> Ed. has an extensive discussion of 
		this matter ("Appenix 8" on the included DVD) and includes all 
		the relevant examples they found. Interestingly, they seem to have missed
		this one, perhaps because the standard references (Peters, CBBM, 
		Sherborn) all misspell the protonym.</li>
	<li>Thus, the conventional spelling is "correct", but not for the reason
		that would seem obvious.</li>
	<li>While the Commission loudly trumpets their enthusiasm for "stability" of nomenclature, their actions demonstrate that
		they consider grammar to be <b>more</b> important.</li>

<ul>
	<li>The AOU CL 5th ed. gives the page number as p.273, though the name <i>fortuitus</i> appears
	on p.274.</li>
	<li>The type specimen was collected by Capt. Ch. Bendire, who sent it to Wm Brewster.</li>
	<li>The page error is replicated in Peters CL <b>XII</b>:81.</li>
	<li>The location of the type specimen is, at the moment unclear.  It does not seem to be in the MCZ collection.</li>

Macronyx fuelleborni <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>9</b>:142 (= White 1960) spells the
       	specific epithet with a double -ii ending.</li>
	<li>It was originally spelled with a single -i ending.</li>
	<li>In the same volume of Peters Checklist, on p.332, Austin Rand
	is able to get the spelling correct for <i>Dryoscopus feuelleborni</i> also
	named by Reichenow in the same volume and number of Orn.Monatsb.
	One would have thought that the juxtapositions of the two different 
	spellings as listed in the Index would have prompted a closer examination 
	of the original descriptions, or even Sclaters <i>Systema Avium Aethiopicarum</i>, 
	where the names are correctly spelled.</li>
	<li>Thanks to Colin Jones for bringing this to my attention.

		<li>The name was published April 16, 1853 in No. 1329 of the Athenaeum.
		This fact was discussed several decades ago and the description there

Lonchura malacca ferruginosa <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The Richmond Index has two cards for this taxon, one gives the
	citation as conventionally given (pll.90 &amp; 91), and the other
	gives pl.89! (which is usually cited for <i>Loxia javanensis</i>).</li>
	<li>I presume the card citing pl.89 is an error. [I suspect that it is
		not written in Richmond's hand, but of this I can not be sure].</li>
	<li>The two cards can be seen here:<ol>

	<li>The Richmond Index card for <i>Loxia javanensis</i> cites pl.89 (as

Hemixos flavala <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

	<li>A number of names (<i>Hemixos flavala hildebrandi</i>, <i>Hemixos flavala davisoni</i>,

	for these names, but gives the wrong reason for this. The Corrigenda states these names were "[described in Hemixos]".</li>
	<li>These names were <b>not</b> described in <b>Hemixos</b> but rather in <b>Hemixus</b> which is an emendation
	of <b>Hemixos</b>. In such instances the Code (1999 Art. 51.3.1) indicates that that the parentheses should be not be used.</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:110 (= Snow 1967) cites this name to

	That issue of Orn.Monatsb. was volume <b>XX</b> no.5, and is the May 1912 issue.
	The name was certainly published in Mess.Orn <b>III</b> no.2 on April 21 (o.s.) which

inconsistencies in this matter without comment. However starting with Corrigenda 6,

Finsch / Meyer <strong>Authority</strong>
<ul>
<li>With regard to names published in the 1885
Zeitschrift F&uuml;r Die Gesammte Ornithologie there is inconsistency with regards
the attribution of authority. The taxa are attributed to Finsch alone or to Finsch
and Meyer.</li>
<li>Progress towards understanding the correct approach will require examination of
the full article containing the original descriptions. The Richmond Index indicates
for these names that they are due to:<pre>"Fischer in lit. in Fischer &amp;
Meyer</pre></li>
<li>I speculate, and it is only speculation, that Fischer may have written a letter
to Meyer including descriptions and possibly names, and that this material is either
included in or refered to in the article.</li>
<li>Given the current uncertainty, I feel it best to attribute the names to both
authors, as the ICZN Art. 50.1.1 states:<pre>

50.1.1. However, if it is clear from the contents that some person other than an
	author of the work is alone responsible both for the name or act and for
	satisfying the criteria of availability other than actual publication, then that
	other person is the author of the name or act. If the identity of that other
	person is not explicit in the work itself, then the author is deemed to be the
	person who publishes the work.</pre>

It is a little uncertain if this applies in this instance as both persons are the
"person(s) who publish[.] the work. but so far that is my best consideration.</li>

<li>A peculiar bibliographic situation exists here. The latter portion of Lawrence's

occurs at the end of the volume. A footnote at the bottom of the initial page of the continuation
states, "This portion of the paper was inadvertantly left out by the editor." The pagination is peculiar
in that the final page of the "General Index" has page numbers "428", "429" at the top of the
two columns (all other "General Index" pages have only one page number for the two columns). The 
next page (on which the bird description occurs has no page number imprinted (!), but clearly
it should be regarded as the equivalent of "429" as the following page is numbered "430".</li>
<li>The note at the top of the "continuation" says: "[Continued from p.359]", though it appears to me

Himatione sanguinea fraithii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>In Rothschild's original description in the Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist. ser.6
<b>X</b> no.55 July 1892 p.109 the name is spelled <i>Himatione Fraithii</i>
(note the <b>ai</b> and the <b>-ii</b> ending).
Normand David has examined this, and tells me (<i>in litt.</i> 2007.02.24) that
in that work there is no mention made of the man who is being honored by the
name.</li>

<li>In the next year (1893) Rothschild's Avifauna of Laysans was published; in
that work Rothschild refers to his 1892 work with the spelling <i>Himatione
fraithii</i> but at the heading of this entry the name is spelled "HIMATIONE
FREETHI" (note now the <b>ee</b> and the single <b>-i</b> ending). Reference is
made on within this section to Mr. Freeth, who is the governor of the island

introduction on p.x).</li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>14</b>:94 (Greenway, 1968) further muddies the water,
he lists "<i>Himatione fraithii</i> (lapsus)" for the Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist. name
but then lists the name as: "<b>Himatione sanguinea freethii</b> Rothschild,
thereby creating a combination of the two names ("ee" from one rendering and
"ii" from the other) and a text string never employed by Rothschild.</li>

<li>We can <b>infer</b> that Rothschild intended to honor Mr Freeth, but he
does not state this explicitly, and in fact Mr Freeth apparantly is never
mentioned when the name is coined.</li>

<li>My interpretation is that the "<i>freethii</i>" form usually employed (by
followers of Peters/Greenway) constitutes <b>an</b> unjustified emendation:
changing the original "ai" to "ee".</li>

<li>Many will disagree but I feel the original spelling must stand.</li>

Cymbilaimus lineatus fasciatus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several nomenclatural points arise here:<ol>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:154 lists the authority in parentheses, and this is
	followed without comment by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:379, though HBW
	<b>8</b>533 (Zimmer &amp; Isler, 2003) lists the authority without
	parentheses.</li>
	<li>The author of the article in question (not seen) is by Nutting, though it was
	"edited" by Ridgway.</li>
	</ol>
<li>So the questions are: who is the author of the taxon, and should it be in
	parentheses.</li>
<li>The author of the taxon is conventionally given as Ridgway, for this and other
taxa described as new in this article, and without seeing the article I am not in a
position to say whether there is merit to the convention.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index shows (in agreement with the Peters Checklist) that the bird
was described as <i>Cymbilanius lineatus fasciatus</i> so the question about the use
of parentheses turns on the name <b>Cymbilanius</b>. The Richmond Index indicates
that this name is an emendation of Gray's name <b>Cymbilaimus</b> and explicitly
stating that it is an emendation on three separate cards, and even noting on one
that: <pre>
Sclater actually seems to have thought Gray wrote it <u>Cymbilanius</u> as he quotes
Gray that way!</pre>
(this entry for the PZS 1858 pt.26 no.359 p.206 entry).</li>
<li>There is still question in my mind as to whether Nutting should be included in
the authority, but it seems quite clear that the authority should not be listed in
parentheses, as Ridgway was using an emendation.</li>

&amp; Susem. V&ouml;g. Eur.</i> Taf.8a(1841);</pre></li>
<li>Bonaparte. Conspectus Generum Avium <b>1</b>:24 (1850) has a complex rendering listing the name in the
synonomy of <i>Falco lanarius</i> as follows:<pre>
15.<b><i>Falco lanarius</b>, Schleg. <sup><small>ex Belon.</small></sup> vix L! (fel-
 deggi, Schlegel). Pl. enl. 470. </i>jun. -<i>Naum. t. </i>14.<i> f.</i> 22.<i>

(single "-i" again). </li></ol><br></li>

<li>Browning &amp; Monroe. 1991. Arch.Nat.Hist. <b>18</b>(3):390 discuss this situation in detail. They conclude
that <i> Falco feldeggii</i> was first published in 1843, in Heft 2 of the <i>Abhandlungen</i>, though accomodating
all
the evidence requires some speculative scenarios. At issue is the fact that Schlegel in Heft 2 of the
<i>Abhandlungen</i> refers to the <i>&Uuml;bersicht</i> (held to be published in 1844). The <i>&Uuml;bersicht</i>
would thus appear to have priority and be the cited source for  this name (as some workers actually do). Browning
&amp; Monroe speculate that Schlegel's reference to the <i>&Uuml;bersicht</i> results from it's being in press or
based on his having the manuscript.</li>

In summary, at this point we have a mixture of dates, sources, Hefte, plates, and taxon spellings.</li><br>

<li>The date would be the nicest to sort out first. If priority could be
determined, much of the rest might follow. For the <b>Abh.Geb.Zool.</b> we have 1841 (Sharpe, Sherborn) and
1843 (Peters, Richmond, HBW); for the <b>Susem.Eur.Vog.</b> we have 1841 (Sharpe); which leads us to a very
interesting second card in the Richmond Index. (I do not further pursue the 1844 <b>Krit.
&Uuml;bers.</b>).</li>

<li>A second card in the Richmond index quotes Hartert. 1915, Novit.Zool. <b>22</b>:181 as follows:<pre>
"under plate 8a in <u>V&ouml;gel</u> <u>Europas</u> <u>von</u> <u>Susemihl</u> <u>mit</u> <u>Text</u> <u>von</u>
<u>Schlegel</u> (about 1843 or 1844. The plates appeared doubtless 
later than the plates 8 and 9, as it is printed on different 
paper, and is not mentioned in the text to the first 
forty-six plates. it must, however, have appeared before the 
description in the <u>Abhandlungen</u> [ Geb. Zool. etc. Heft III. 1843
p.2,3. pl.10 + 11], because it is there quoted on p.3)."</li>
<li>This would appear to suggest that the citation given by Peters (and followed by most workers) may thus not be
correct. Additionaly, mystery and complexity surrounds the publishing history of the
Vog.Europas[Susemihl]. It appears it was issued from 1839 to 1851, and as of yet I have not determined if it is
possible to determine the limits of the various Lieferung (Hefte), or their dates of issue.</li>
<li>[2010.05.31]This card also notes that the original spelling on the plate is <i>felddeggii</I>(!), and
presumably the plate does not otherwise refer to Baron von Feldegg himself.</li>

<li>It appears that Schlegel himself was confused here, Sharpe's footnote CBBM <b>1</b>:389 reads thus:<pre>
<center> 8. Falco feldeggii*</center>
	...
	...
 *Professor Schlegel named this bird as above, but afterwards reverted to the
name of <i>Falco lanarius</i>, because he became convinced that it was the Lanner of
old falconers.  We have, however, to deal with the question of the proper title
of this species according to the recognized rules of nomenclature.  <i>Falco
lanarius</i> is Gmelin's title, taken directly from Linn&aelig;us's bird of the same name
(Faun. Suec. p.33 no.62). This is irrecognizable, but looks like a young
Peregrine; it certainly is not the Falcon now known as the true Lanner. It is 
likewise mixed up with the Lanier of Buffon (Hist.Nat.Ois. i. p.243), and the 
Lanneret of Albin (Nat. Hist. of Birds, ii p.7 pl.7). Considering the confu-
sion in which the specific name is involved, it seems better to adopt the term of
<i>Falco feldeggii</i>, which undoubtedly belongs to the species.</pre></li>

<li>Hartert's argument that the relevant plate in Susemihl was published prior to Abh.Geb.Zool. seems worth
heeding, and until additional information becomes available I will regard that as the citational source with
priority. The problem then devolves to deciding what year should obtain. The <b>published</b> dates for this taxon
in the Susemihl work are 1841, and 1843. I adopt 1841, following Sharpe and Sherborn.</li>

Accipiter superciliosus fontainieri <strong>Spelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>This specific epithet was originally spelled "<i>Fontainieri</i>",
and in the text of the original description, Bonaparte refers to <pre>
M.  Fontainier</pre> <strong>not</strong> M. Fontanier.
The original text reads:<pre>
&raquo; Avant de quitter les Falconides, disons que M. Fontainier vient
d'en rapporter une esp&egrave;ce qui devra porter son nom (<i>Accipiter
Fontainieri</i>) si elle est nouvelle. ....</pre>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):335 lists this as <i>fontanieri</i>. As
is typical for the Peters Checklist, no rationale or justification is
given; <i>fontainieri</i> I presume, is interpreted to be an error that
justifies emendation. What, if any, understanding of the nature of this
problem the authors had will remain uknown to us. The Peters Checkist, of
course, is followed without comment or other consideration by most other
workers.</li>

<li>The gentleman in question is listed as "M. Fontanier"
as the collector of the specimen in the Richmond Index.</li>

<li>I sought Normand David's input on this question, who indicates (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.03.12) his
interpretation that the Code would require the specific epithet to be
<i>fontainieri</i>, consistent with the reference made in the original
description.</li>
<li>This further suggestst that determination of the proper spelling may
(regrettably) devolve to the question of "prevailing usage".</li>
<li>Normand David provided me with a copy of <cite>Voisin C, Voisin J-F.

I interpret <i>socle</i> to refer to the base or plinth on which
the specimen was displayed.	And I think the <i>&eacute;tiquette</i> refers to the
inscription on the pedistal.</li>
<li>The work by the Voisin's suggests to me that the previous certainty regarding the correct spelling
of the gentleman's name may have been more apparent than real.</li>
<li>Much of the confusion may result from Sharpe's entry in Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. 1874 <b>1</b>:139 where in the

<ul>
<li>Listed by Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:181 (Traylor) as published in
1861. This is followed by HBW <b>9</b>:405 (J.A. Mobely).</li>
<li>This 1861 date was initially followed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:373,
however it was corrected in the Corrigenda 2.1 to 1862.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index shows that this part of this volume was published
Feb. 1, 1862; Duncan also was able to determine that 1862 was the correct
year, though he felt that April was the month of publication. Duncan did
extremely good work, so good that he often agrees with Richmond's dates.
It is my bet that Richmond is correct here.</li>
<li>No matter how good Richmond's work, or Duncan's work, it seems that in
some instances Traylor consulted one (or both) of them, but in other
instances, such as this, didn't.</li>

<li>This is followed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:296, and HBW

<li>The Richmond Index indicates that 1879, the actual publication date,
was indicated in a Corrigenda.</li>
<li>Further support for this interpretation comes from by way of Edward
Dickinson, who communicates that Saunders in Zool.Rec. <b>16</b> Aves
p.2 "reports that the Preface is dated 'Calcutta 21st. Dec. 1878' and
that as publication was in London this cannot have been before 1879 and
he says that 'as a fact [it] was not.'"</li>
<li>Edward Dickinson further communicates (2004.12.03) that he examined the copy at
Tring, which has the Corrigenda bound in. The Corrigenda refers to delay until 1879.
In the Tring copy, the Corrigenda was bound into the volume of plates.</li>

<li>Regarding Lafresnaye's specimen (which evidently is in the collection of the  M.C.Z.) the Richmond Cardex makes the
 following remarks:<pre>
<i>Remarks.</i>--The large size of Lafresnaye's specimen, the dark back,
heavily streaked pileum, hindneck and sides, without any olivaceous shade,
the orange-ochraceous rump and sides, the grayish throat and chest, very
distinctly streaked -- all agree with only the northern form named <i>salvini</i> by
Ridgway and certainly not with <i>A. citreopygus</i> (Bonaparte), the recorded 
range of which has recently been extended to western Colombia, by  Chap-
man (Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., XXXVI, 1917, p.495).</pre>

Otus flammeolus <strong>Date</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>4</b>:95 as "1852, 1853".</li>
<li>HBW <b>5</b>:164 lists the year as 1853.</li>
<li>Murray Bruce determined, by using Hartlaub's series of yearly
literature reviews, that only the articles on pp.141-162 in this work
were published in 1853. Therefore, this name is referable to 1852.</li>
<li>I still have some uncertainties regarding this citation. The name <i>Scops
flammeola</i> in the Richmond Index is only listed to Sclater's 1858 use in PZS. It 
is noted there that it is a <i>nomen nudum</i> with a note also indicating it is in
"Jardine's Contrib.Orn., 1852, p. 111" without further details, or even mentioning
Kaup.</li>
<li>It is my guess, that in Contrib.Orn. this occurs in "no.6" for 1852.
<li>Confusingly, the CBBM <b>2</b>:105 refers to a "<i>Megascops flammeola</i> Kaup,
Trans.Z.S. iv p.226" The Transactions of the Zoological Society were published
irregularly, and at the moment I don't know the year date for Vol.4 in the series.
Vol. 1 was published in 1833/34, so it is not impossible that Kaup's use of the name
there antedates the use of <i>Scops flammeola</i> in Contrib.Orn. (!).</li>

<li><cite>Pacheco and Whitney. 1998. BBOC  <b>118</b>:259-261</cite> show that this taxon,
originally described by Nitzsch [Nitsch], was synonymized to <i>Hydorpsalis</i> 
(= <i>Macropsalis</i>) <i>creagra</i> by Bonaparte in 1850.</li>
<li>This name <i>Macropsalis creagra</i> was reintroduced by Peters <b>4</b>:219.</li>
<li>Peters designates the type for the Genus "<i> Caprimulgus forcipatus</i>
Nitzsch = <i> Hydropsalis creagra </i> Bonaparte 
(Hartert, Cat. Bds. Brit. Mus., <b> 16 </b>, 1892, p.601)." </li>
<li>Hartert's treatment of the genus is on p.601, however Nitzsch's name is
used on p.603, where Hartert clearly recognizes:<ol>
	<li>Nitsch [Nitzsch] as the author,</li> 
	<li>the name as <i> forcipata </i>,</li> 
	<li>and Bonaparte's <i> creagra </i> as a synonym.  </li></ol>
<li>The logic of Peters' interpretation is not evident to me.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:245 has a footnote referring to some of these issues. It reads:
<small><pre>
"Cleere (1999:385) used the name <i>forcipata</i> Nitzsch, 1840, but used <i>creagra</i> in Cleere
(1998). This change, about which see Pacheco &amp; Whitney (1998), is associated with unresolved 
issues and, although we accept that <i>forcipata</i> is not a <i>nomen oblitum</i>, we defer
its adoption.</pre></small></li>
<li>I speculate that this reservation regarding the adoption of <i>forcipata</i> may turn on
considerations of whether <i>creagra</i> constitutes a "prevailing usage" as defined by the ICZN.
"Prevailing usage" appears to be applied predominantly to "emendations", and
<i>creagra</i> would hardly seem to be an emendation of <i>forcipata</i>. (Leaving aside
the virtually unusable ICZN definition of prevailing usage):
<pre>Usage, prevailing, <i>n</i>. Of a name: that usage of the name which is adopted by at
least a substantial majority of the most recent authors concerned with the
relevant taxon, irrespective of how long ago their work was published.</pre>
The disagreements over "substantial majority", and who constitutes " most recent authors concerned with the
relevant taxon" are easy to anticipate.
</li>
<li>Without more understanding of Peters' logic, or what issues are "unresolved" I use <i>forcipata</i>.</li>
<li>Pacheco sent me (2003.12.09) a copy of the 2002 Arajuba note further
illuminating the details here <cite>Pacheco JF, Whitney BM, &amp; Pioli
D. 2002. "Additional notes on <i>Caprimulgus forcipatus</i> Nitzsch,
1840 (=<i>Macropsalis forcipata</i>)." Arajuba
10(2):272-273.</cite>.</li>
<li>They argue:<ol>
	<li>The name <i>focipatus</i> Nitzsch is not a <i>nomen
	nudum</i>.</li>
	<li>Nor is it a <i>nomen dubium</i> and is referable to the name
	bearing type specimen held in the Institute of Zoology of the
	Martin-Luther-Universit&auml;t, Halle-Wittenberg.</li>
	<li>In summary: "<i>Macropsalis forcipata</i> (Nitzsch, 1840) is the
	correct name for the Long-trained Nightjar."</li>

Megapodius forsteni <strong> Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This name is found with both single "i" (<i>forsteni</i>) and double "i" 
	(<i>forstenii</i>) endings.</li>
	<li>Recent authors seem to generally use the -ii ending (without comment), while
	I find earlier works seem to use the -i ending (for example Sherborn's Index Animalium).</li>
	<li>Dr David Donsker informs me that on examining his own copy of the work, it shows that
	the name is spelled <i>forsteni</i> in the text and <i>forstenii</i> on the plate. At
	the moment I am not aware of any indication that the plates were published apart from the
	corresponding text, but in this work with a confusing and not-fully-worked-out publishing
	history, it seems almost anything is possible.</li>
	<li>Thanks to Dr David Donsker for bringing this to my attention.</li>
	<li>Dr Donsker also subsequently notes, that Gray spelled the name a third way,
	(<i>forsteri</i>) in the index -- clearly a <i>lapsus</i>. More importantly,
	Gray, in his Handlist (published later in 1869, uses <i>forsteni</i> with one "i".
	If no action prior to the publication of Gray's Handlist satisfied the requirements
	for a first reviser, then Gray's use of the single "i" ending would appear to
	meet that requirement. Article 24.2.4 of the Code (1999) reads:<pre> 
24.2.4. <b>Original authors may be deemed to be First Revisers of spellings.</b> 
When the author, or one of joint authors, of two different original spellings of 
the same name subsequently uses one of them as valid in a work (including the 
author's or publisher's corrigenda), and neither had previously been selected as 
the correct spelling by a First Reviser, the author is deemed to be the First Reviser, 
whether or not the author cites both spellings together (that used as valid 
becomes the correct original spelling).</pre>
<li>[2010.01.08] David, Dickinson, &amp; Gregory. 2009. "Contributons to a List of First Reviser actions: ornithology." Zootaxa 2085:1-24 hold Gray to be the First Reviser (p.6) when he used <i>forsteni</i>.</li>

<hr><A name="A.flavirostraSpell"></a>
Amaurornis flavirostra <strong>spelling  </strong>

<ul>
<li>Often spelled <i>A. flavirostr<b>is</b></i>.</li> For an explanation, 
I quote Normand David's explanation of this issue.<pre>

names ending in <i>-rostra</i> end in the modified Latin noun <i>rostrum</i>, 
and all are <b>INVARIABLE</b>. 
Adjectives formed on <i>rostrum</i> end in <i>-rostris</i>, <i>-rostratus</i>, 
etc., and are <b>variable</b>.

Things get complicated when the gender of a genus is not properly assessed.

<i>Gallinula flavirostra</i> Swainson, 1837, is known as <i>Amaurornis flavirostra</i>
[as per Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990)], not because <b>Amaurornis</b> is feminine, but
because <b>flavirostra</b> is INVARIABLE; this is why, even though 
<b>Limnocorax</b> is masculine, it is also listed correctly as 
<i>Limnocorax flavirostra</i> [as per Peters (1934)].

<b>Amaurornis</b> Reichenbach 1852 (Av. Syst. Nat, p. xxi) ends in the
transliterated Greek noun <i>ornis</i>, which is masculine as well as feminine,
but was established in combination with <i>olivacea</i>, and is thus 
feminine as per ICZN (1999, Art. 30.1.4.2). 
Peters (1934), and Dickinson et al. (1991)] correctly treated <b>Amaurornis</b> as feminine.

The following spellings are incorrect:<ul>
<li><i>Amaurornis flavirostris</i> [of Dowsett &amp; Forbes-Watson (1993), Urban et al. (1986), del Hoyo et al. (1996)], and
<li><i>Limnocorax flavirostris</i> [of Wolters (1982)].
</ul>

To change <i>flavirostr<b>a</b></i> to <i>flavirostr<b>is</b></i> would 
turn an invariable noun-phrase ending in a modified Latin noun into a variable adjective.</pre>

<li>The <b>Zoo. Rec.</b> in the period from 1978-1992 uses only the form
<i>A. flavirostr<b>is</b></i>; it occurs once between 1981 and
1992.</li>
</ul>

<hr><A name="A.francesiaeSpell"></a>
Accipiter francesiae <strong>Spelling </strong>
<ul>
<li>Normand David writes (2001.01.04, 2001.01.09)<pre>

According to <cite> Dowsett, R. J. &amp; Dowsett-Lemaire, F.  (1993.  A contribution
to the distribution and taxonomy of Afrotropical and Malagasy birds.
Tauraco Res. Rep. 5.  Tauraco Press, Li&egrave;ge),</cite> "Accipiter francesiae is the
correct spelling..., and not francesii..., this lapsus on the part of Sir
Andrew Smith being corrected by Benson et al. (1976-77)".
The Benson reference is a series of articles in L'Oiseau &amp; RFO.
Benson et al. 1976 (<cite>Contributiuon  l'ornithologie de Madagascar, Oiseau &amp;
RFO 46: 103-134</cite>) stated (p. 122) that Smith named the bird in honour of a
woman, and "manifestement, francesii est un lapsus pour francesiae".

I don't know if they were right according to the ICZN 1960 Code, but they
are according to the 1999 Code - the only one that prevails today.

The bird was named to honour Lady Frances Cole (Jobling 1991), but the
original name is a masculine genitive (e.g. <i>francesii</i> from Francesius, 
the latinization of Frances).

However, ICZN 1999 Art. 31.1.2 states "A species-group name, if a noun in
the genitive case formed directly from a modern personal name, is to be
formed by adding to the stem of that name -i if the personal name is that
of a man, ..., -ae if of a woman...; the stem of such a name is determined
by the action of the original author when forming the genitive".

In the original <i>francesii</i>, Smith used the stem <i>francesi-</i>; 
therefore the feminine genitive is <i>francesiae</i>. [If Smith had used the 
stem <i>frances-</i>, from Francesus, the latinization of Frances, 
then the genitives would have been <i>francesi</i> (masculine) 
and <i>francesae</i> (feminine)].

I am not familiar with those types of names, but the very clear and
explicit wording of ICZN Art. 31.1.2 leaves hardly any room for another
conclusion.

The prerequisite condition is that Smith indication that he wanted 
to honour a woman in his original description.
