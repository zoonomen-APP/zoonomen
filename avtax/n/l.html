Stephanoxis lalandi loddigesii <strong>Author</strong>
<ul>
	<li> The authority is conventionally attributed to Gould</li>
	<li> The original description can be seen here:<a href="./image/PZS_1831_12.jpg" target="new">PZS 1831 p.12</a>. <br> 
	and it states: <pre> 
	Mr. Vigors exhibited several species of Humming-birds from the collection
	of Mr. John Gould, one of which, previously undescribed, had been dedicated to Mr. George Loddiges, F.L.S., &amp;c.
	It approaches most nearly to the <i>Trochilus Lalandei</i>, Vieill., but may be distinguished
	from that bird... by the following characters: ..."</pre></li>
	<li>The Code states: "...if it is clear from the contents that some person other than an author of the work is alone 
	responsible both for the name or act and for satisfying the criteria of availability other than actual publication, 
	then that other person is the author of the name or act."</li>
	<li>Gould's role here is not "clear": did he attribute the name "<i>loddiges</i>? Clearly he did, given Vigors' attribution.
	Did he recognize the differences in plumage? Probably he did.
	Did he prompt the "nomenclatural act" (the publication of this name and description)? This is not clear.
	In 1831 Gould was emphatically <strong>not</strong> in the habit of publishing his taxa, and particularly not
	in serial literature. (His first publication containing new names was, in fact, in 1831, in the book Cent.HimalayanBirds (with an imprint
	date of 1832). His first publications in PZS were in 1832.</li>
	<li>Thus, my interpretation is that in the abscence of clarity regarding Gould's role, Vigors is the author of the name.</li>

Vanellus crassirostris leucopterus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Conventionally cited to 1889.</li>
	<li>The number in which this appears (no. 187 "Juli") includes a dateline on p.321 of<pre>
	"Hann. M&uuml;nden, October 1889."</pre>
	Also on p.326 is the dateline:<pre>
	"Dresden, den 10  November 1889."</pre>
	So the imprint date of "Juli" is demonstrated to be incorrect.</li>
	<li>The first evidence that I know of for this being in existence as a published work is the
	notice given in the 1891 Ibis p.616 where this number was noted as rec'd at the Zoological Soc. on 
	Jan. 14, 1890.</li>

		<a href="./image/revuezoologiquep05soci_0186.jpg"
	target="new">Rev. Zool. 1842 p.174</a>.</li>
	<li>Many authors spell the epithet <i>lessoni</i> with a single -i ending.
	In this they are probably following CBBM <b>17</b>:324, but not Peters
		<b>5</b>:226, which has the correct -ii spelling.</li>

	<li>We will have to see if those who embrace error because of their personal and parochial
	sense of familiarity will attempt to invoke "prevailing usage" in support of what
	appears to be a casual and understandable blunder. 
	Desperation may invoke calls for nomenclatural "stability" (which is never defined)
	in support of a "pet name", wrong as it may be.</li>

Lamprotornis splendidus lessoni <strong>Citation</strong>

		<i>Judia Lessoni</i> Pucheran, 1859, Rev.Mag.Zool. (1858), p.259</pre></li>
	<li>The basis for Amadon's belief that this portion of Rev.Mag.Zool. was delayed
	until 1859 is not clear. Note that no volume number is given in the citation,
	which suggests the possibility that this citation was taken from CBBM <b>XIII</b>:173,
	though the citation there is given (without volume number) to 1858.</li>
	<li>So far I do not find this citation in the Richmond Index.<li>
	<li>This name occurs in the "<i>Juin</i> 1858" number, and definite evidence 
	that it was delayed into 1859 would be required to accept that date.</li>

<A name="TuckeyLeachAuthor" id="TuckeyLeachAuthor"></a>
Leach <strong>Authority</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The authority for bird names in this work is traditionally attributed 
	to William Elford Leach. Probability suggests that Leach is responsible for the names
	but my reading of the work and of the ICZN Code suggests that attribution solely to
        Leach does not seem to fully comport with the meaning of the Code. More correctly
	the authority might be attributed to Leach &amp; Koenig,KD, or possibly to Leach, 
	Koenig,KD &amp; Brown, or less probably Tuckey, Leach, Koenig,KD &amp; Brown.</li>

	<li>Page lxxxii of Tuckey's Narrative (1818) includes the following (note that the bird names
	are in Appendix 4): <pre>
	The papers, No.2 and 3 in the Appendix, by Doctor
	Leach, and Sir Everard Home, respecting the parasitic
	<i>Vermis</i>....
		The other papers in the Appendix, illustrative of those 
	subjects in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms
	which occurred along the lines of the Zaire, as far, at least,
	as the materials sent home would admit, were obligingly
	drawn up by Doctor Leach and Mr. Koenig of the British
	Museum, and by Mr. Brown, Secretary to the Linnean
	Society, and Librarian to Sir Joseph Banks; ...</pre></li>
	<li>The relevant portion of the Code is: <pre>
	50.1.1. However, if it is clear from the contents that some person other 
	than an author of the work is alone responsible both for the name or act 
	and for satisfying the criteria of availability other than actual publication, 
	then that other person is the author of the name or act. 
	If the identity of that other person is not explicit in the work itself, 
	then the author is deemed to be the person who publishes the work.</pre></li>
	<li>The "author" of this work is largely Tuckey, though he died well before it was published.
	The "Appendix" is essentially a separate work with multiple authors as designated in the
	"Contents" and "Introduction", though responsibility for who did which part is not
	"clear" from the contents.  All in all, attribution of authority is 
	not clear (at least to me) from the wording of the Code.</li>
	<li>Therefore, it seems clear that Leach, Koenig, Home, and Brown are the authors
	of the Appendices; Leach and Home are designated as the authors of the reprinted
	material (App.2&amp;3),  Brown is designated as the author of the Botanical 
	material, and Leach and Koenig are the authors of the rest -- including Appendix 4
	where the new names appear.</li>
	<li>It is reasonable to speculate that Leach is the author of the bird names, but it is
	only a <b>speculation</b>, and is not clear from the contents of the work alone. Therefor
	I attribute the authority for these names to the author(s) of the work (<i>i.e.</i> the 
	Appdeniceal material that is not otherwise specified as to author.</li>

	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:580 fn.7 refer to the <i>lopesi</i> spelling as an "emended" name, without

	<li>Through Corrigenda 8 (2008) no reference it made to published data in support of this judgement,

	<li>I note and ignore this opinion.</li>
	<li>HBW <b>11</b>:600,601 uses <i>lopezi</i> and discusses the spelling. The opinion is rendered there

Anthreptes longuemarei <strong>Citation</strong>

	<i>Cinnyris longuemarei</i> Lesson, 1831, Illustr. Zool., pl. 23.</pre> and the name <b>does</b>
occur in that work in the text to pl.23. It is in livr.8 of Illustr.Zool. which most probably was
published in 1833 -- a fact probably not known to Rand.</li>
	<li>Gadow (1884) in CBBM <b>9</b>:115 cites this as:<pre>
	Cinnyris longuemarii <i>Less.</i>, Bull.Soc.Nat. <small>XXV</small>. p.242 (1831); <i>id</i>
		<i>Ill. Zool.</i> pl. 23 (1831).</pre>. While Gadow gets the spelling of the name wrong,
he does note it's presence in Bull.Soc.Nat. -- which it seems Rand did not investigate.</li>
<li>The name is in Bull.Soc.Nat. <b>25</b> on p.342, and published in June of 1831.</li>
<li>Thus the Peters citation is incorrect, and those who change the date to 1833 (the correct date for Ill.Zool.)

Corvus corax laurencei <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:515 initially follows the incorrect
	spelling <i>laurenci</i> -- apparently following Cramp 1994 (not seen). But this is
	corrected in Corrigenda #3.</li>
	<li>The Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:281 has the spelling correct.</li>
	<li>Of interest, the CBBM <b>3</b>:15 (= Sharpe 1877) spells this <i>lawrencii</i> (!)
	even though it appears that the text of the work indicates that this was named 
	for "Laurence, a late Viceroy of the Panjab" (Richmond Index).</li>
	<li>The only appropriately named fellow I can find, however, is
	John Laird Mair Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, GCB, GCSI, PC (4 March 1811 - 27 June 1879) 
	an Irishman who became a prominent British pro-consul and imperial statesman. He served as 
	Viceroy of India from 1864 to 1869, having earlier earned the sobriquet "Saviour of the Punjab".
	He was raised to the peerage as Baron Lawrence, of the Punjaub and of Grately in the County of Southampton.</li>
2013.09.27
	<li>The Richmond Index suggests that Hume's name is spelled both as <i>laurencei</i> and as </i>lawrencei</i>
	and further that the name is a junior synonym to Severtzov's "1872" name. Severtzov says he suspects
	that Hume's <i>Corvus lawrencei</i> (his spelling) is his own <i>Corvus subcorax</i> "published in Dec. 1827"

<li>As Jan Kaiser noted (<i>in litt.</i> 2007.12.15) volume one of this publication

<img src="./image/Aq_leucor.jpg"></li>
<li>Undoubtedly, the authors of this portion of the Peters Checklist 
(Stresemann and Amadon) merely copied the citation and did not trouble to check it.
The CBBM <b>I</b>:308 may be the source of this erroneous citation. Sharpe gives
the citation there as:<pre>
Aquila leucorypha. <i>Pall. Reis. Russ. Reichs. </i> i p. 454 (1771).</pre>
Sharpe in turn may have attempted (without success) to follow Strickland 1855

<li>This taxon is dated by Peters Checklist <b>13</b>:308 (= Paynter 1970) to 1839 without comment, 
discussion, or presentation of evidence in support of this date. This date is also used by the AOU CL (6<sup><small>th</small></sup> &amp; 7<sup><small>th</small></sup>), similarly without discussion or
comment. Sherborn's Index Animalium lists the date as 1840.</li>
<li>This portion of the Journal (volume <b>8</b> Part I) was Presented to the Academy meeting
on May 5, 1840, which does not explicitly support a date of 1839.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index raises the question of a possible author's separate, which may have
been published in 1839.</li>

Richmond's interpretation, as well as the pattern of publication of the Proceedings,

Diopsittacus nobilist longipennis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Originally described by Neumann as <i>Diopsitta nobilis
longipennis</i> and now held to be in the genus <b>Diopsittaca</b>
Richmond.
This has understandably created confusion as to whether the authority
should be place in parentheses. [HBW <b>4</b>:426 does not place the authority
in parentheses, but H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:196 places the authority in
parentheses.]</li>
<li>However, to date (2004.09.27) there is no evidence that anyone ever
erected a genus <b>Diopsitta</b>. If this is true then Neumann's rendering
can be regarded as a misspelling or an unjustified emendation. The ICZN
Code (1999) states (51.3.1):
<pre> Parentheses are not used when the species-group name was originally
combined with an incorrect spelling or an emendation of the generic name
(this applies even though an unjustified emendation is an available name
with its own authorship and date).</pre></li>

<li>Certainty in this matter would be aided by examining the original
description (not seen).</li>
<li>In consideration of this problem, Steven
Gregory adds useful additional understandings (<i>in litt.</i>2004.09.27):
<pre>
I think I can give another twist to this -- 
the date of Neumann's introduction of the combination "<i>Diopsitta" nobilis
longipennis</i> (1931) is instructive, in that it is too late to introduce a new
generic name by means of a new binomen (or trinomen) alone. In other words there,
presumably, is no 'Intent to differentiate' as defined by Recommendation 13A, nor
(again presumably) is there the express fixation of a type species as required by
Art. 13.3.

I would therefore conclude that "<b>Diopsitta</b>" is an incorrect subsequent
spelling of <b>Diopsittaca</b> and that brackets should not be used.

The caveat is, of course, unless the original paper introducing
<i>longipennis</i> gives a contraindication to this assessment!</pre></li>

<li>David and Gosselin. "<i>The grammatical gender of avian genera.
</i>" BBOC 2002. <b>122</b>(4):258 present compelling evidence that the 
name is feminine. The Latin noun <i>Lagopus</i> is feminine, and Brisson 
himself consistently used feminine adjectives in combination with
<i>Lagopus</i>.</li>
<li>The Oxford Latin Dictionary. Glare. 1982 lists:<pre>
<b>lagopus</b> ~odis, <i>f.</i> [Gk. <i>&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</i>]
	<b>1</b> A ptarmigan.
	<small>praecipus sapore ~us P<small>LIN.</small> <i>Nat.</i>10.133.</small>

<li>In dicussing this matter Normand David (2004.02.04) sends along additional notes of interest

Remember Art. 26: 
	"If the spelling of a scientific name...is the same as a
Greek or Latin word. that name...is deemed to be a word in the relevant
language unless the author states otherwise when making the name
available". 
Brisson did not say that he was using the Greek word
<big>&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</big>, thus he was using the classical
Latin feminine noun <i>lagopus</i> (white grouse, ptarmigan), 
as given by all Latin dictionaries.
	I have checked Pliny's text for the use of <i>lagopus</i>: to refer 
to the beast, Pliny uses the feminine determinative pronoun "<i>eam</i>" 
in the accusative case (from <i>ea</i> = this/that). There is no doubt
whatsoever that <i>lagopus</i> is a feminine Latin noun. </pre>

Leptodon <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li><b>Leptodon</b> vs <b>Odontriorchis</b></li>
<li>A useful note on this question from Dick Banks (2003.05.05) reads:
<pre>
1950 would seem to be the time that the name went back to <b>Leptodon</b>. <ul> 
<li>In the Mexican Check-list (Friedmann, Griscom, and Moore) the species is called
<i>Odontriorchis palliatus</i>.</li>  
<li>In Friedmann's part 11 of Ridgway's Birds of N & M America, it is <i>Leptodon cayanensis</i>.</li></ul>
The first was out in June 1950, the second in Sept. 1950.  
It seems obvious that Friedmann changed his mind while that volume of Ridgway 
was in prep., maybe in press.  There is a paragraph on p.94, at the end of the 
description of the genus <b>Leptodon</b> that uses the name <b>Odontriorchis</b>, 
which apparently he neglected to change. Also, in the list of synonyms and citations 
for the generic name, he uses the wording for the type species 
<i>Falco cayennensis</i> Gmelin = </i>Falco palliatus</i> "Max" Temminck, 
suggesting that the latter is the valid name for the
species. But then he uses <i>Falco cayanensis</i> Latham for the name of the
species.  
	The citation of the type species of <b>Leptodon</b> Sundevall on the card in the
Richmond files is like the AOU Check-list, not as in Friedmann 1950 or in
revised vol. 1 of Peters.  And I have no idea why we [AOU] list the type locality
of <i>cayanensis</i> Latham as "in Cayana = Bahia, Brazil."  Bahia is the revised
or restricted type locality for <i>palliatus</i>.

Okay, I looked last where I should have looked first, at Hellmayr &
Conover, 1949.  Cat. Birds  Amer., part 1, no. 4. <b>Leptodon</b> Sundevall is NOT
preoccupied by Rafinesque's name, which actually was different.  And there
is no reason to reject Latham's <i>cayanensis</i>, which is what had opened the
door for <i>palliatus</i>.  And Bahia in the type locality came from Spix, and
should not be equated to Latham's <i>Cayana</i>. 

Friedmann apparently got Hellmayr and Conover after preparing the Mexican
Check-list[;] [...] before completing the volume of Ridgway but too late to cite
it.  Everyone since has followed H&C and/or Friedmann, but apparently no one
has ever said why (if they knew), at least in anything I looked at.  

Addendum--Eisenmann 1955 used <i>Leptodon cayanensis</i> and said "<i>Odontriorchis
palliatus</i> of many authorities" in a footnote, but did not say why.

and does not respond to recorded voice calls of <i>C. larvatus</i>.</li>
<li>Bob Dowsett writes (2003.02.08):<br><pre>
<big><b><i>Columba (Aplopelia) simplex</i></b></big>:
The voice of <i>A. larvata s.l.</i> shows many dialects (pers obs &amp; published recordings), 
and it is clear that this is true even with the insular <i>simplex</i> 
(see Christy's book on birds of Sao Tom&eacute; &amp; Principe). There is the
added problem that morphologically it is difficult to separate these
island birds with confidence (see White's 1965 Checklist of
Non Passerines), and Sao Tom&eacute; is the type locality of simplex
s.s.  So we've little confidence in HBW's treatment (and note that
Borrow &amp; Demey have none either), so would advise against splitting
<i>simplex</i> from <i>larvata</i>.

Knipolegus lophotes <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul> 
<li>I am confused by this citation, and give it here as shown in Peters Checklist
<b>8</b>:178 (Traylor), and in Sherborn. I do not find a card for this name in the
Richmond Index. (other than one which refers to a 1927 Hellmayr use of the name).</li>
<li>The Catalogue of Birds of the British Museum <b>14</b>:43 (PL Sclater) gives the
citation as: "Knipolegus lophotes <i>Boie, Isis,</i> 1826, p.973." This is citing the
location where the genus <b>Knipolegus</b> is erected.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index card for the genus <b>Knipolegus</b> indicates that Boie refers to 
<pre>
"Musc. lophotes Tem. und
cyaneirostris Vieill. Az. 181."</pre>

Which further confuses me regarding the name <i>lophotes</i>.</li>

<li>Steven Gregory has done some looking into this problem and writes (2003.10.25):<p>

<b>Knipolegus</b> is very interesting. Edward [Dickinson] and I have photocopies of Boie's
article. <b>Knipolegus</b> is introduced thus:<p>

Isis Von Oken, 1826, vol. 19. Col. 973
First part of footnote 2 (to X. Fam. Muscicapidae Vigors. Muscicapa Lin.)

<pre>
Ferner k&ouml;nnten als Gattungen abgesondert werden: <i>Knipolegus</i> f&uuml;r <i>Musc.
lophotes</i> Tem. und <i>cyaneirostris</i> Vieill. Az. 181;</pre>

Which translates roughly as:<p>

Furthermore could be isolated as genus: <i>Knipolegus</i> for <i>Musc. lophotes</i> Tem.
and <i>cyaneirostris</i> Vieill.  Az.  181;<p>

I cannot (yet) find where Temminck may have used '<i>lophotes</i>' prior to 1826,
but nevertheless P.L.Sclater (1888: 43) identifies Boie's 1826 use of the
combination <i>Knipolegus lophotes</i> with <i>Muscicapa galeata</i> Spix, Av. Bras. ii.
p.20, pl.27 (male) [1825]. This in turn, Traylor in Peters [<b>8</b>] (1979: 178),
considers to be 'not Lichtenstein, 1823' and promotes Boie's later use:
<i>Knipolegus lophotes</i> Boie, 1828, new name for <i>Muscicapa galeata</i> Spix, 1825.
This is not, I suspect, anywhere near the bottom of the species name issue
raised here, but it would appear that Boie has listed two species with the
introduction of <b>Knipolegus</b>, and with nothing that looks like a designation.
This leaves Traylors statement (1979:173) 'Type, by monotypy, <i>Muscicapa
cyanirostris</i> Vieillot.' looking a little contrived (or did he leave Zimmer's
MS untouched for this genus?).<p>

Turning to the 'usual suspects' for subsequent designation I find:<p>

G.R.Gray, (1840: 30) <b>Knipolegus</b>, Boie (1826). <i>K. comatus</i>, (Licht.) n. <i>M.
lophotes</i>, Temm. <i>B[lechropus] cristatus</i>, Swains., <i>K. lophotes</i> Boie. [all
listed by Sclater (1888: 43) in the same synonymy.]<p>

G.R.Gray, (1841: 40) ditto.<p>

G.R.Gray, (1855: 48) <b>Knipolegus</b>, Boie (1826). <b>Cnipolegus</b>, Strickl. 1841.
(<i>Muscicapa comatus</i>, Licht.)<p>

P.L.Sclater (1888: 42) <b>Knipolegus</b>, Boie, Isis, 1826, p. (sic) 973. ... type <i>C. comatus</i>.<p>


All of which suggests that the Crested Black Tyrant (correct name?), rather
than the Blue-billed Black Tyrant is the type...

I/we need to look further into the species name question, the key will be
whether Temminck's presumed use of <i>lophotes</i> which prompted Boie to quote it,
actually exists. Otherwise most uses of <i>lophotes</i> will be <i>nomina nuda</i> [until
Hellmayr, 1827, as suggested by Wolters (1977: 181)?].<p>

<a id="LepidothrixNomenclature" name="LepidothrixNomenclature"></a> Lepidothrix
<strong>Nomenclature</strong>. 
<ul>
<li>The name <b>Lepidothrix</b> terminates in <i>thrix</i>,
transliterated from the Greek <big>&theta;&rho;&iota;&xi;</big>
[thrix: hair] which is feminine, therefore ICZN 1999 Art. 30.1.2
indicates the genus group name is feminine.</li>
<li>Paclt (2009) Zoosyst.Evol. 85(1):161 argues that 
<b>Lepidothrix</b> Bonaparte 1854 is "obsolete" (? meaning ?) "and, 
<b>perhaps</b>, slightly junior" to <i>Lepidothrix</i> Menge 1854" (emphasis added).</li>
<li>Paclt may be right but certain questions are raised by his paper. <ul>
	<li>First, it is not clear to me that Menge 1854 actually uses "Lepidothrix".
		Neave (Nomenclator Zoologicus) <b>II</b>:897 indicates that
		in the publication in question Menge uses <b>Lepidotrix</b> (not
		<b>Lepidothrix</b>) and this is also how it is represented in
		Schulze <i>et al.</i> p.1801. [The genus group name is used
		for a Silverfish (Thysanura)].</li>
		<li>Second, it seems to me that if <b>Lepidothrix</b> the name is 
		"perhaps, slightly junior" to Menge's name (presuming that that name
		<b>is</b> "Lepidothrix" and not "Lepidotrix") then it is also perhaps
		slightly senior to the name.</li>
		<li>Third, one notes with interest that the family involved is
		<b>Lepidotrichidae</b> (not <b>Lepidothricidae</b>, and is listed
		(at least by Wikipedia) as containing the genus <b>Lepidotrix</b>,
		not <b>Lepidothrix</b>.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>I also note in passing, that Paclt lists an author as R&ecirc;go in the body of the
	text, but R&ecirc;ge in the <b>References</b>, though I don't believe this has any bearing
	on the genus group name matter. I am sensitive to such errors, as they are 
	the kind I myself make all the time.</li>

<li><i>Alario leucolaema</i> Sharpe, 1903 must be corrected to

<a id="Latham1802" name="Latham1802"></a>
<strong>1801 <i>vs</i> 1802</strong> 
<h4>Background</h4>
<ul>
<li>A confusing and contentious case.</li>
<li>Two works come under consideration: <ol>
	<li>The General Synopsis Supplement II, (or the General Synopsis II)</li> 
	<li>the Suppl.Ind.Orn. (or Latin Supplementum) 
</ol><p>
These are bibliographically distinct entities. It appears that they were usually,
and perhaps always receieved together, but advertisments from the time seem
to clearly indicate that the Latin Indices could be purchased as a separate item.
It is not clear if this was in 2 volumes (as some advertisments say) or one volume, as
a contemporaneous review indicates (see below). <p>

Adding to the confusion is the fact that <b>both</b> works are referred to as "Supplements" and are 
supplements to previous extensive work by Latham.
The General Synopsis II is in English, and the Suppl.Ind.Orn. is in Latin. Only the 
Latin Supplementum contains binomial Linnean names and it is the date of publication
of this portion that is of nomenclatural importance. <p>

It has been held by various workers that the Latin Supplementum was published <b>before</b> 
the General Supplement II, <b>simultaneously</b> with it, or <b>subsequent</b> to it.

Both works were produced by the same printer and in the copy I have examined are on paper of 
similar character (which in much of the volume has a distinctly bluish cast). This characteristic
is also seen in other copies and the evidence is strong that both works were published using the
same stock of paper. The watermarks and countermarks on the leaves are the same and occur in the same 
location on the leaves in the material examined so far.  Note, Schodde <i>et al.</i> (see below)
state <pre> The texts of both works were printed on the same pale bluish paper with the same
watermark (1800) in the same position and alignment on the pages, indicating they were printed together.</pre>
My examination of the work indicated that the countermarks included the date, which I remember as "1797", but Donsker
confirms as 1800 in his copy,
Schodde <i>et al.</i> appear to have confused watermarks with countermarks, but that is unimportant.<p>
I do not agree however, that the same mark (countermark) "indicat[es] that they were printed together" but merely that
the same paper stock was used. A large paper stock could be used over multiple years and for several publications. </li>

<li>The title pages of the two works appear in multiple states, though I believe only one "state"
has been found for the Latin Supplementum. The Latin Supplementum bears the date MDCCCI (1801), which
on the face of it would seem to provide a simple resolution to the matter. To date it has not.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Previous discussions of the work</h4>

This work has been dated 1801 or 1802 by various workers. A selection of 
some of these considerations are below.

<ul>
	<li>Charles W. Richmond was concerned with the issue of the date of publication.
	He noted in his unpublished notes on Dates of publication that the General Supplement II
	contained specific page number references to the Latin Supplementum. This is important
	because it was believed that the General Supplement II was not published until 1802 and
	this seemed to imply that the Latin Supplementum could not be set in print until after
	the General Supplement II was set in final printing form.<p>

	Here is Richmond's note.<p>

	<img src="./image/L030.JPG"><p>
Richmond's decision is thus based on the date 1802 in his copy of the General Supplement II.</li>

<li>Kirke and Swann ("A Bibliography of British Ornithology" 1917 p.341) in a footnote comment to
their dating of 1802 state:
<pre>Some copies are dated 1801, the second "I" in title date having apparently been
inserted after it was printed.</pre>

	<li>Whittell ("The Literature of Australian Birds" 1954 p.411) wrote regarding the date of the General Supplement II:
<pre>Some copies have been met with bearing the date 1802, so there were,
apparently, two issues.</pre>

	<li>Zimmer ("Catalogue of the Edwrard A.Ayer Ornithological Library" 1926 p.375) dates the work "1801?".</li><p>

	<li>Browning and Monroe ("Clarifications and corrections of the dates of issue of some publications containing descriptions of North American birds." 1991) p.385-386 discuss this matter and
	resolve that 1802 is the appropriate date. They base this date on the fact that
	1802 is the first time the work can be demonstrated to exist as a published work, because
	this was when Latham presented a copy to the Royal Society. He had been elected to the
	Royal Society 30 April 1801, but did not present the work to the Society until 1 April 1802. <!-- [both days are Thursdays] --></li><p>
	
	I believe Browning and Monroe were correct about the date of presentation to the 
	Society, but wrong about the date of Latham's election to Fellowship in the Society.
	This is understandable, as there were two John Latham, M.D.'s and both were
	members of the Royal Society and the Linnean Society. The John Latham in question here
	was elected in 1775. The two John Lathams are detailed by the Society as follows:

	I have some comments on this interpretation of Browning and Monroe.<ol>
		
		<li>I don't see these as "coincident" as they did not all occur at the same time, 
		but that is unimportant.</li>
		<li>Browning and Monroe do not <b>explicitly</b> state that anything was "indicative 
		of a single issue". What they say is:<pre>
Whittell (1954) suggested that there were two "issues." Nowever, only 250 of the scheduled 500 copies
of <i>Supplement II</i> were printed, and these were the property of the publisher 
(Latham, 1821:vi). </pre> (For Whittell's statement see above).<p>
		I find this statement by Browning and Monroe to be less explicit than 
		might be hoped for. They certainly seem to imply (quite strongly) that there 
		was a single "issue" but don't make it clear how they think the reduced 
		number of copies (250 instead of 500) supports a conclusion of a single state of 
		issue, which again they imply but do not explicitly state. In my view,
		the number of "issues" remains indeterminate. (See below for a discussion
		of states or variants versus "issues").</ol>

Schodde <i>et al.</i> report finding that the 
General Synopsis II occurs in three distinct <strong>date</strong> states:<ol> 
	<li>some with a  printed Roman Numeral date of MDCCCI (1801)</li> 
	<li>some with a printed Roman Numeral date of MDCCCI and with a hand addition of a "I" 
	to make it MDCCCII (1802)</li>
	<li>some with a printed Roman Numeral date of MDCCCII (1802).</li>
	</ol> 
There appear to be two <strong>plate</strong> states on the title page:<ol>
	<li>some with a colored figure of the Maned Duck (<i>Chenonetta jubata</i>)</li>
	<li>some with a black and white figure of the Maned Duck (<i>Chenonetta jubata</i>)</li> 
</ol><p>

<li>In the copies Schodde <i>et al.</i> examined
it appears that the colored plate is found only in those with a printed date of 1801 or
a date hand corrected to 1802.<p>
To quote Schodde <i>et al.</i> (p.233) <pre>
"copies (5) of the <i>English Supplement II</i> printed with the date of 1801 or corrected by
hand to 1802 bear a coloured figure of the Maned Duck (<i>Chenonetta jubata</i>) on the title
page, whereas in those with a printed date of 1802 (2), the figure is in black and white."</pre>
Thus I was a bit puzzled by the image below, and presumed that it was a <strong>black and white pdf</strong> in which the color does not show (http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/85230#6)
<img src="./image/cihm_17933_0005.jpg"> I emailed the Alberta Library to determine the nature of this image.
	I was informed that the microform copy they have was prepared at the University of British Columbia.
	Inquiry of the UBC Library indicates that the microform copy was prepared from a copy in their holdings.
	This matter was investigated by the helpful people at the UBC Library. Katherine Miller there reports (2010.08.17) that
   <pre>I checked our print copy of the Latham's General Supplement II. 
I would like to confirm it's states: 1801 (in Roman numerals). 
The plate is in black and white. Also, the paper has a bluish tinge.</pre>
	So clearly this represents yet another state, different from those described by 
	Schodde <i>et al.</i>, as this
	example has an 1801 date and an uncolored title page plate. 
	(See below for possibly more important variant "states" undiscussed by any of
	the authors above except Richmond). The only implication evident to me from this
	is that a bewildering number of states of this publication exist, and we can
	only speculate on what implications flow from that fact.
	</li>
<p>
<h3>Principles of the Code</h3>

<li>[2010.07.17] Before further addressing the complexities of this matter it is helpful 
<strong>first</strong> to have in mind the approach required by the Code.
The relevant portions of the Code are these:
<ol>
	<li><pre><b>21.2.</b> Date specified. The date of publication specified in a work is to 
	be adopted as correct in the absence of evidence to the contrary.</pre></li>

<li><small>[<b>21.3</b> deals with determining day, or month of publication, 
	and does not concern us here.]</small>

	<li><pre><b>21.4.</b> Date incorrect. If the date of publication specified in a work is 
	found to be incorrect, the earliest day on which the work is 
	demonstrated to be in existence as a published work is to be 
	adopted. In the absence of evidence as to day, 
	the provisions of Article 21.3 apply.</pre>
	</ol>

	[The Code treatment appears to take the position that dates are either correct or incorrect, 
	I presume "uncertain" is tantamount to incorrect, but all may not agree with this. 
	Certainly the Code implies that some action must be taken in the <strong>presence</strong> 
	"of evidence to the contrary." <p> The Code does not indicate a course of action to take 
	if a work has multiple dates specified 
	(as is the case here). It would seem that both dates can not be "correct", 
	suggesting to me that
	one date is certainly incorrect, but we don't know which one.] <p>

	I interpret the underlying logic as follows:<ol> 
	<li>Use the imprint date unless there is evidence to the contrary (21.2). (Note 
	that there is no qualification about the strength of the evidence which is unfortunate). </li> 
	<li>If there <b>is</b> evidence to the contrary, use the date when the work 
	is demonstrated to be in existence as a published work (21.4).</li>
</ol><p>

It does <strong>not</strong> say: "Use the date specified in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, but if there is only <strong>weak</strong> evidence to the contrary, 
then come up with a speculative scenario that you favor and that you think is probable 
and use the date implied by your speculations." <p>

I do think it is appropriate to take an approach which says in the face of uncertainty, do not rely
on speculation and imagination, but use <b>established</b> facts.</li><p>

<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> address this problem somewhat differently, they state:
<pre>
Article 21.2 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, hereafter the Code 
(ICZN 1999), governs the specification of dates of publication as follows: the date of publication 
specified in a work is to be adopted as correct in the absence of evidence to the contrary. 
The French text of this article, equivalent in force (<b>Article</b> 86.2 of the Code), 
is even clearer and stronger, with 'evidence' replaced by 'preuve' = proof. 
The date specified on the title page of the Latin Supplementum is 1801, without any exception 
and variation whatsoever; and in the context of <b>Art.</b> 21.2 of the Code, 
evidence for 1802 is presently much too circumstantial and open to question to displace it. 
Corroborating the view from the Commission, the SCON accordingly recommends use of 
1801 as the date of publication of the Latin Supplementum unless or until much firmer 
evidence for 1802 is found.</pre>
<ul>
	<li>I wonder if "preuve" really <b>replaces</b> "evidence"? I would have stated 
	that it was <b>in the place of</b> it.
	Certainly a "picky" point, but "replace" suggests an active substitution of 
	one for the other, which may in fact have happened., However,
	The Code Preface (p.XVI) indicates at least some of the French text composition 
	preceeded the English text, and the French text "proved of major importance for the
	development of the English text", so perhaps "evidence" <b>replaces</b> "preuve"? </li>
	<li>In their interpretation, Schodde <i>et al.</i> feel that the approach is to read the
	texts in conjunction (Schodde <i>in litt.</i>), with the result that the evidence be 
	conclusive to the point of proof. I interpret this to mean that the French text
	trumps the English text further implying that they are not of equal force, 
	so perhaps I do not understand Schodde's point. 
	A requirement that the English text be read in conjunction or "combination"
	(see also Schodde <i>et al.</i> 2007. BBOC <b>127</b>(4):273)
	with the French text would not seem to me to be concordant with the "equivalent
	force, meaning and authority" relationship established in the Code itself (<b>Art.</b>
	86.2). </li>
	<!-- <li>I presented my findings of the newspaper 
	advertisments in 1802 with none in
	1801 to Schodde who felt that "none of the newspaper article you quote support 
	one another about the first date of publication of the English Supplement." </li> -->

</ul>

</ul>

<p>


<h3>States, variants, and "issues"</h3>

These bibliographic technical terms are often confusing; a consideration of these matters is 
most useful if the definitions are explicated.<p>

Definitions of "issue" <ol>
	<pre>
<li>An </i>Issue</i> is the whole number of copies of a form of an edition put on sale
at any time or times as a <b>consciously planned printed unit</b> and varying only in relation to the form
of an 'ideal copy' of this unit. The criteria are that the book must differ in some typographical way
from copies of the edition first put on the market, yet be composed largely of sheets deriving
from the original setting; and that the copies forming another issue must be a <b>purposeful</b> publishing unit 
removed from the original issue either in form (separate issue) or in time (reissue).</li></pre> (emphasis added)<p>

</pre>"Principals of Bibliographic Description", Bowers F, Russell &amp; Russell, NY. 1962 p.40</li>

<li><pre>An <i>issue</i> is all the copies of that part of an edition which is identifiable as
a consciously planned printed unit distinct from the basic form of the ideal copy.</pre>
"A New Introduction to Bibliography" Gaskell P, Oak Knoll Press, New Castle, Delaware 1972 p.315</li>
<li><pre>When alterations, corrections, additions or excisions are effected in a book during
the process of manufacture, so that copies exhibiting variations go on sale on publication
day indiscriminantly, these variant copies are conveniently classified as belonging to different
<i>states</i> of the edition. ... When similar variations can be clearly shown to have
originated in some action taken after the book was published, two (or more) <i>issues</i> are
distinguishable.
</pre>
"ABC for Book Collectors", Carter J, Alfred A Knopf, 5<sup><small>th</small></sup> ed., Revised.
1987 p.121-122</li><p>

Carter goes on to say (p.122)<pre>
Yet in fact the onus of proof that an observed variation derives from a deliberate action taken <i>after</i>
publication lies, or should lie, like an iron weight on the conscience of anyone who begins to write the word <i>issue</i>.
It is a salutary, if rather too sweeping, preposition that all variants of this kind should be called <i>states</i> until
they have been proved otherwise -- or simply left as VARIANTS.</pre>


</ol>


<li>Schodde R, Dickinson EC, Steinheimer FD &amp; Bock WJ. 2010. "The Date of Latham's
<i>Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici</i> 1801 or 1802?" 
South Australian Ornitholgist <b>35</b>(8):232-235 demonstrate (as others have) that the 
General Supplement II exists in more than one state, though "state" is not a term they use.
They provide evidence of at least three variants (or states), and discuss some, but not all
of the variant states that are known to exist.
They also appear to assume that these different variant states constitute different 
"issues" (p.233), though the basis for this assumption is not discussed. 
Assuming that a "state" or "variant" is equivalent to an "issue" is a simple, but profound error. The presence of "at least two issues" 
(p.233) appears to be central to their argument, as they state that the 
presence of multiple issues 
<pre>breaks the nexus between the <i>Latin Supplementum</i> and a single issue of the <i>English Supplement II</i>.</pre>
Establishing multiple "issues" (according to the bibliographic definitions above) requires either 
determining the initial date of publication (an end toward which this exercise is directed) or
establishing what Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son saw as constituting a "planned printed unit".
As far as I can tell none of these have been done, so it appears to me that the presence of 
"issues" in this matter remains for the moment entirely speculative.
Also note that they imply three different states for the General Synopsis, but mention only "at least two issues" (p.233). 
I am confused by the use of "issue" made by Schodde <i>et al.</i>. <p> 
<!--  making
it appear almost certain that one of the issues (with a colored plate of the Maned Duck 
(<i>Chenonetta jubata</i>) on the title page) was most probably issued in 1801 (the imprint date
on at least some of the extant volumes of the English Supplement II). This, in my view, reduces the
otherwise sticky problem of the fact that the Latin Supplementum refers to pages specifically
in the English Supplement II, which if held as published in 1802 then implies an 1802 publication
for the Latin Supplementum. It has been noted, and Schodde <i>et al.</i> comment, that Latham
<strong>could</strong> have had page proofs of the English Supplement II available to him (in 1801)
when he was writing the Latin Supplementum, but this is mere speculation and does not constitute
evidence or proof. --></li><p>

<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> also emphasize important information revealed in a 
footnote in Latham's 1821 "A General History of Birds". The text there reads:
<pre>
	*A little time prior to the publication of the Second Supplement, on finding it very
	inconvenient to confer with my Booksellers so often as I had been accustomed to do, from the
	great distance I then lived from London, I agreed to put the remaining copies of the Seven
	Volumes, then published, into their hands, at a fair valuation; and finding it to be their wish
	that I should form an Eighth Volume, from the additional material I had collected since the
	publication of my first Supplement, I furnished it to them, to be printed at their own cost;
	but not long after, I learned, to my surprise, that instead of 500, the number of copies
	printed of the former Volumes, only 250 were struck off. What end this was to answer was
	known only to themselves, and I think it right to mention the circumstance here, to exculpate
	myself from the blame which has attached to me on that procedure, and which from that
	Volume not being then my property, it was not in my power to prevent.</pre> 

and can be examined here:
<a href="./image/cihm_18204_0010.jpg" target="new">Latham 1821 p.vi</a>.<p>

The footnote indicates that control (printing, production, and release to the public 
[<i>i.e.</i> publication]) were entirely under Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son's control. 
Latham also indicates that the publishers responded to forces unknown to Latham and 
resulting in an outcome that was surprising and disappointing to him (producing only 
250 rather than 500 copies). Their actions were unkown to Latham and surprised him when he 
learned of them. Now, over two centuries later, our
knowledge of what occured, why, and when is necessarily uncertain.<p>

The relation between Latham and the firm of Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son seems peculiar.
Leigh, Sotheby and Son published almost nothing but Auction Catalogues at this time.
The fact that John Latham was John Sotheby's cousin (ref. Herrmann F. 1981 "Sotheby's
Portrait of an Auction House". WW Norton &amp; Co. p.14) may possibly have played a role
in their decision to continue publishing Latham's material. <p>

Schodde <i>et al.</i> correctly indicate that "the London publisher (Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son) managed and distributed both" Supplements...
"and was free to issue them at any time once they were printed" (p.233). 
However, the time of issuance is speculative,
they were equally free to delay issuance if they felt there were other matters of greater priority.
Presumably this was not the only work Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son managed at this time 
and other considerations could easily have been factors in the timing of the distribution of the material. 
Imaginative speculation can come up with a host of scenarios, many of which would posit issueance in 1801, and many of which could produce a delay into 1802.<p> 

<li>I wondered what taxa might be affected by dating this work to 1801 or 1802.</li>

The Richmond Index notes that the genus group <b>Menura</b> appears to have been a late addition to the work. 
Richmond does not indicate how he knows this,
but it appears that the nature of the material supports his assertion. Thanks to Daria Wingreen-Mason's expert examination
of the two copies in the Cullman library, we know that <b>Menura</b> occurs on the asterisked single leaf with signature "Mm5" (pages 271* 272*).
Wingreen-Mason indicates that asterisks were used to indicate "bis" and these pages follow directly after 
unasterisked pages of the same numbering.
The unique text shows that the pages are not cancellans, and their nature as an "addition" is further 
supported by the fact they are a single leaf signature.
The potential that this single leaf may be a possible clue to the dating problem flows from the fact that precedence for the name <b>Menura</b> may be contested 
between Latham and Davies. This matter is not discussed by Schodde <i>et al.</i>.<p>

The details of that matter I understand as follows: <ul>
	<li> Major-General Thomas Davies presented a description of the genus <b>Menura</b> and described <i>Menura superba</i>. this was read November 4, 1800, and
	published in volume VI of the Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 24 May to 27 May 1802. In this paper he refers to a speciemn sent to Lady Mary Howe as a gift, 
	as well as two specimens in the possession of Sir Joseph Banks, that were apparently subsequently depositied in the British Museum. [Lady Mary Howe, was 
	Lord Howe's wife, Lord Howe is known (among other things) for his defeat of the French Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse in the Battle of the Glorious First of June, 1794, 
	the first major naval battle in the war with revolutionary France. He (Richard) is also the brother of Lord William Howe, whose tactical and strategic decisions
        enabled British defeat in the American Revolutionary War.]
	The paper that Davies read on 4 November is appended by an expanded written description from additional specimens. 
	This expanded description is dated 19 June 1801. Whether or not Latham was aware of the paper as read, or the material
	to be published is currently unknown to me. Davies (understandably) makes no mention of Latham, and Latham makes no mention of Davies, the paper he read, 
	or the publication by the Linnean Society.</li>	
	<li>Latham is slightly less helpful regarding the provenance of his specimens. I do not recognize any specimen-source information in the Latin Supplementum; the English
	<i>General Supplement II</i> gives no provinance for the main specimen described, but he does refer to a specimen in the British Museum (? possible one of the Banks specimens?),
	and two specimens from "Mr Thompson of Saint Martin's Lane".</li><p>

</ul>	
Thus, if a date later than late May is established for Latham's Latin Supplement, priority for the name
<b>Menura</b> would go to Davies, but Latham's presentation of a copy to the Royal Society on 1 April 1802 eliminates this possibility. Schodde <i>et al.</i> discussed the problem of the possibility
of Davies' name having priority (2007. BBOC <b>127</b>(4):273) but dismissed the the problem
based on their interpretation that 1801 was the date of publication for Latham's work.
In my view, even if 1802 is accepted as the date of publication for Latham's use of the name
the date of March or April still preceeds the established date for the Davies publication.</li><p>

<li>We can only speculate on the implications that may be attached to the apparent
reduction of the production run to 250 copies rather than the 500 Latham expected. These speculations
are limited only by one's imagination.

<!-- It seems to suggest that Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son did
not expect this to be a big seller and perhaps not to be an important item 
from a buisness point of view; it may well have had a low priority in their shop. 
If one is to indulge in specualtion it seems
unlikely that Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son would say "we have this work for which we
expect very limited sales, therefore we must be sure to release it to the public quickly
as our highest priority."  More likely, they might work on it as time and resources permitted.
It is also certainly possible (but not proven) that Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son would have
released various "batches" of the publication, as suggested by it's different "states".
All these are speculative considerations and not, I believe, determinative from the
standpoint of the Code. We simply don't currently know when, how, and why Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son
released these materials. -->

<p>

<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> state (p.233) <pre>[the presence of multiple states of
the English Supplementum II] is evidence that there were at least two <u><strong>issues</strong></u> 
of that work, so breaking the nexus between the <i>Latin Supplementum</i> and a single
issue of the <i>English Supplement II</i> (emphasis added).</pre><p>

It does not seem to me that the number of <u><b>issues</b></u> of this work has been established, 
and I believe no useful discussion of this is presented by Schodde <i>et al.</i>, and indeed I am not
sure what their definition of "issue" is. There is nothing to
prevent different "states" of a work from being issued at the same time. Again, it must
be emphasized that Latham's own subsequent (1821) evidence indicates that
Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Sons were free to produce and issue the material in any manner they 
saw fit. </li>

<li>The Code does not currently propose that contested considerations of dating be 
resolved by a competition between speculative scenarios. Schodde <i>et al.</i> 
present only one possible scenario, but many others are similarly possible.<p>

It is not <b>improbable</b> that with multiple changes, and with other additional
considerations not relating to <b>this</b> work, Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son may have delayed release to the public (<i>i.e.</i>
publication) of the material until these considerations were resolved. We don't
know if this publication had a high priority, or a low priority for Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son.
It is reasonable to speculate that due to their ownership of the material they felt free 
to deal with it in a manner commensurate with all of their priorities and consisderations.
They do not appear to have expected much in the way of sales for the work (as evidenced
by cutting the production run in half from its companion works). 
It appears they felt they were released from satisfying Latham's expectations, and
could deal with the matter at their convenience. They owned the material and we must expect
that it was dealt with in a manner commensurate with all the priorities of the firm. I also 
speculate that concerns over publishing <strong>priority</strong> (which <b>we</b> are 
so concerned with) may not have concerned them at all.</li><p>

<li>The tantalizing possibility of resolving all this by recovering records from the firm
of Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son (now Sotheby's) would appear to be prevented by the tragic fact of the 
fire on 29 June, 1865 that gutted Sotheby's and destroyed most of their stock and buisness records.
(ref. Herrmann F. 1981 "Sotheby's Portrait of an Auction House". WW Norton &amp; Co. p.55). </li>
<p>


<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> state quite explicitly that there is "evidence for 1802" (p.233) but
move to dismiss it on the grounds that it is "too circumstantial and open to question" --
no such qualifying language or rationale is expressed in the Code.</li>

<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> also comment that the French and English texts have "equivalent force"
(p.233) quoting the Code <b>Art.</b> 86.2. I interpret this to mean that one can not say the French text (using the word "prueve") is
any more or less "correct" than the English text (using the word "evidence"). Certainly it is 
not currently "proven" that the date 1801 is incorrect, and therefore since the English text has
"equal force" we must then ask is there "evidence" that it is incorrect. Schodde <i>et al.</i>
state, as indicated, that there is. It then seems to me that the appropriate course is to proceed
on the basis of Article 21.4, and we know that this was in existence as a published work
in April of 1802, with the delivery of the work to the Royal Society.<p> 
In passing it is interesting to note that the French heading of Article 21.4 is 
"<b>Date  inexacte</b>". It is a mistake (and an understandable one) to think that
when the French say "inexacte" they mean "inexact". My petite LaRousse (1963) p.548 defines
INEXACTE as "Qui contient des erreurs; faux" which I interpret as: "containing errors; false",
indeed, what we think of as "incorrect" (as used in the English version of 21.4). 
The Latin "exacte", of course means "precise, accurate", 
more in-line with English use. "Correct" in the LaRousse is defined as 
"conforme aux r&egrave;gles" (conforming to the rule). It seems to me that in these senses
"inextacte" is more appropriate than "incorrecte".</li>

<li>I consider this to be an interesting and challenging case, and one which is not well served by
the language of the Code as currently constituted. I say this because there <b>is</b> still 
"evidence" against accepting 1801, and the first demonstration "of its existence as a 
published work" (the language of Art. 21.4) is apparently in April of 1802, when a copy was
presented to the Royal Society.</li>

<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> emphasize the existence of different "states" of the English 
Supplement II (which they call "issues" and which have attendant potential 
implications for the dating of the Latin Supplementum).
Perhaps it is appropriate to treat "states" the way the Code treats "parts", but if this is made
explicit, I don't find it.</li><p>

<li>Additional points regarding Schodde <i>et al.</i>
	<ol>
		<li> On p. 231 they state: <pre>
	These same species were published concurrently 
	in vernacular English in the <i>Supplement</i>.</pre>
	Given that the dates and nature of publication are in question, can it be 
	stated that they were published "<u><strong>concurrently</strong></u>?
	then treat it as an established fact. In addition this idea of "concurrent" 
	publication would seem to contrast with their statement (p.233) 
	<pre>that there were at least two issues of that work,
	thus breaking the nexus between the <i>Latin Supplementum</i> and a single issue of the 
	<i>English Supplement II</i> supposedly no later than 1 April 1802.</pre>
	On the one hand they are state they are "published concurrently" but on the other 
	hand hold that the "nexus" between them is broken. Which is it?</li>	

	<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> offer no alternative possibilities to the one that they present. 
	Though many others are possible. Perhaps Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son held this as a job of
	very low priority, and with the evidence of ongoing changes and modifications of the work
	held back all copies. Possibly they only released material when Latham himself asked for
	copies to be given to the Royal Society and the Linnean Society and they gave him
	copies and then modified the subsequent copies to comply with the date and the
	content changes that had been supplied. Speculation such as these are limited only 
	by imagination.

	<li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> discuss the reasoning that Browning and Monroe (1991) used in
	coming to their decision that 1802 was correct, but then Schodde <i>et al.</i> 
	supply their own reasoning for that of Browning and Monroe.
	For example, Browning and Monroe make no mention of "page proofs", 
	though Schodde <i>et al.</i> imply that 
	Browning and Monroe felt that the <i>Latin Supplementum</i> "could not have been 
	type-set until page proofs of the <i>English Supplement II</i> were available."</li>

	<!-- <li>Schodde <i>et al.</i> indicate that only 250 copies of the second supplement were printed
		("Secondly, only 250 copies of the <i>English Supplement II</i> were released." (p.232).)
		How they know that this limitation was restricted to just the <i>English Supplement II</i> is not known to me.
		Latham's text reads:<pre>
*A little time prior to the publication of the Second Supplement, on finding it very
inconvenient to confer with my Booksellers so often as I had been accustomed to do, from the

publication of my first Supplement, I furnished it to them, to be printed at their own cost;
but not long after, I learned, to my surprise, that instead of 500, the number of copies
printed of the former Volumes, only 250 were struck off. What end this was to answer was
known only to themselves, and I think it right to mention the circumstance here, to exculpate
myself from the blame which has attached to me on that procedure, and which from that
Volume not being then my property, it was not in my power to prevent.</pre>
		
		The Eighth Volume, is the <i>General Supplement II</i>, and appears to include the 
		Latin Supplementum (see below).
	        The relation between the issuance/publication of the
		Latin Supplementum and the English General Supplement II is not firmly established. They may have been 
		issued together sometimes, always, or never. </li> --><p>

	</ol>

<li>There is an additional, and in my view more important, variant "state" of this work 
The Richmond index mentions a page that is an apparent "late addition" to the work; 
the page where the genus <b>Menura</b> is described. In support of the
possibility that this was a "late addition" to the work is the fact that it is a single leaf 
signature "Mm5" and with pagination "271*, 272*". It is found immediately following pp.271,272 which is part of signature "Mm2" and is followed by signature "Nn".
Note that the signature progression is generally ... Ii Ii2 Kk Kk2 Ll Ll2 &amp;c 
in this portion of the work. "5" is a distinctly unusual suffix. Some letters, 
J in this case, and often I, U, V, or W are often omitted, a convention continued from
the manuscript period.

This added single leaf signature is noted in Zimmer, but other than Richmond no one else seems
to have noted it, commented on it, or considered if it has implications regarding the history
of publication.

To date it appears to be present in most copies of the work. However the copy owned by 
Dr David Donsker <b>lacks</b> this 271*, 272* leaf. The existence of this volume (with a 
colored title page plate, and an imprint date of 1801) appears to me
to be stronger evidence for the possibility of a pre-1802 issue than the evidence suggested 
by Schodded <i>et al.</i>. Stronger evidence but still speculative at this point, it seems to me.</li>

<h4>Additional facts developed in this matter:</h4>
	<ul>
 
<li>With the help of Laurel Peterson (my daughter) I searched the British Newspapers from 1800 to 1803 using the text strings
"Latham" and "birds" (case insensitive), using the Online 19th Century British Library Newspaper Print Data.
This resulted in 40 "hits", which we reviewed.<p>

During this period the very first mention of the General Synopsis is found in 
the March 29, 1802 issue of The Morning Post and Gazateer (Issue 10445, unpaginated)
it reads:<pre>

Again, it must be emphasized that this is the very <strong>first</strong> notice of publication
of this work we were able to find. And of interest this notice does <b>not</b> mention the 
Latin Supplementum. Presumably this is an oversight, as we know that Latham presented a
copy to the Royal Society 3 days later that included the Latin Supplementum. But we thus infer, 
rather than prove the existence of the Latin Supplementum as a published work on March 29.<p></li>

<li>March 29, 1802 (given as "Sunday" by the Gale document, but given as a Monday by the perpetual calendars I have checked)
is the Monday immediately preceeding the Thursday when Latham presented a copy to the Royal Society (April 1).</li>


This is the first, but not the only entry announcing this publication. For those who
are new to the study of advertisments in early 19th cent. British Newspapers, it should be emphasized that such
announcements are often repeated, and indeed, on August 5, 1802 is a similar announcemnt

<li>Also of some interest, this work is first mentioned in the Critical Review or Annals of Literature vol.37 March
in 1803. (Articles IX,X,XI [three articles in one] pp.318-327).
There (p.319) it states:
<pre>	To the second Supplement, which is accompanied by a
Supplement to the Index, we now proceed.</pre>

This statement, and the later notices of publication suggest that the Latin Supplementum was
available either with the General Synopsis II, or separately. There is some uncertainty
as to whether it was a two volume set or one volume set, and there appears to be a 
discrepancy regarding the price of the Latin Supplementum -- possibly a typographic error in
one case or the other.

No combination of searching with "Index", "Indicus", "Latham", "Ornithologicus" yeided any notices
of pubication earlier than those already found.

<h4>Additional notes regarding Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son published (but did not print) this work.
I wished to learn something of their pattern of activity during this period, to try to understand what kind
of priority this publication had.  Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son were primarily developing their auction/booksale
activities and there "publishing" activities were very minimal indeed. During the period 1800 to 1806, other than
an auction catalogue, I could find only one other work besides the Latham material that was "printed for Leigh, Sotheby &amp; Son"
is "The Wiccamical chaplet", George Huddesford, ed. 1804.</li> 
<li>This suggests the possibility that for this busy firm, publishing was a very minor part of their buisness, and possibly
a low priority.</li>

<p> [BEGIN OLD NOTES]<p>


<li>Conventionally cited in the literature as 1801, but interpreted
by Browning and Monroe, 1991 to be 1802. Which I followed until 2003.05.21. At which time
I felt the arguments of Murray Bruce (<i>v.i.</i>) were convincing, and that 1802 was speculative
without actual supporting evidence provided.</li>
<li>Subsequently, upon examination of CW Richmond's unpublished notes on Dates of Publication
the following evidence came to my attention. Richmond has a handwritten card that presents the
following :<pre>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<u>Latham</u>, Suppl. Ind. Orn.
 
dated 1801, But he quotes an article in App. II, 
of his General Synopsis which is dated 1802,
it must therefore have been issued later than 1801.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre></li>

<li>I have now (2004.02.24) examined the General Synopsis, and have a clearer understanding of the
problem, though at the moment a clear resolution is not evident. Similarly it appears I 
will want to re-examine the work above. Initially I had interpreted the note to mean that
"he" (Latham) "quotes an article" (of the Suppl.Ind.Orn.) in the General Synopsis --
but this of course makes no sense with regard to fixing the date for the Suppl.Ind.Orn.
I now think the Richmond card means that within the Suppl.Ind.Orn. that Latham quotes an
article which is in his General Synopsis. Richmond's thinking then is that if the 
General Synopsis is dated as published in 1802 (even though many copies bear 
the imprint date of 1801), then it implies that the Suppl.Ind.Orn.
came out at the same time or later than the General Synopsis.</li>
<li>I think this argument is not unreasonable, but there <b>is</b> the possibility, that as
Latham is the author of both works, he could possibly quote and article of his own, that 
he had written but that had not yet been published.</li>


<li>For the moment, I leave the confused and convuluted notes below I have 
written on this subject.</li>
	
The full facts of the publication history do not appear to be fully resolved with certainty, 
but my current interpretation is as follows.<ul>
	<li>It appears to be established with a high degree of certainty that
	at least the <b>English version</b> of this work, was delayed in publication
	until 1802. I believe it was the discovery of this delay, that prompted
	Browning and Monroe to revise the date to 1802. Browning and Monroe noted
	that "some copies of the work" are dated "MDCCCI" and some "MDCCCII" but
	did not clearly distinguish between the Latin and English versions.</li>
	<li>The fact that the imprint date of the English version was modified to 
	reflect the delayed publication and that the imprint date of the Latin
	version shows 1801 argues for its not having been delayed until 1802.</li>
	<li>If a Latin version of the work was shown have have an imprint date of
	"MDCCCII" I would revert to the interpretation that 1802 would need to be followed for
	all taxa cited from the work.</ul>
<li>Usually cited as 1801, but see <cite>Browning and Monroe, 1991.
<b>"Clarifications and corrections of the dates of issue of some
publications containing descriptions of North American birds."</b>
Archives of Natural History 18(3):385-386.</cite>.</li>

<li>The Handbook of Birds of the World, (at least in volumes 1-6)
continues to list the date as 1801.</li>

<li>Murray Bruce offers strong arguments in <b>favor</b> of 1801.
(2001.05.11) which I include here:
<p>[BEGIN M. BRUCE]</p>

<p>Latham 1801 vs 1802:<br />
I agree with Browning &amp; Monroe 1991 that the English version of
Latham's second supplement to his 'Synopsis' apparently was delayed
until 1802, but disagree that the Latin version was
"<i>probably</i> available that same year" (my italics).</p>

<p>Following Art. 21.2 of the Code, with reference to Art. 21.3,
the date of publication of the Latin version is specified in the
work as 1801 and can be dated to 31 Dec. 1801.</p>
</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>[APP: <b>ICZN</b> "21.2 <b>Date specified.</b> The date of
publication specified in a work is to be adopted as correct in the
abscence of evidence to the contrary."]</li>

<li>[APP: <b>ICZN</b> "21.3 <b>Date incompletely specified.</b> If
the day of publication is not specified in a work, the earliest day
on which the work is demonstrated to be in existence as a published
work is to be adopted as the date of publication, but in the
absence of such evidence the date to be adopted is
<ul>
<li>21.3.1 the last day of the month, when month and year, but not
day are specified or demonstrated, or</li>

<li>21.3.2 the last day of the year when only the year is specified
or demonstrated</li>
</ul>

]</li>
</ul>

There is no proof it came out in 1802, only proof indicating a
delayed publication of the English version.

<p>As early as 1787 (introduction to the first supplement) Latham
was quite clear that Latin diagnoses of the birds described in his
English works needed to be published separately "to be of real
utility". His 1790 Index was the Latin version of his 'Synopsis'
and first supplement, plus some recent discoveries, notably from
Australia. The delayed publication meant Gmelin got the credit for
nearly all his new birds in the 'Synopsis'.</p>

<p>In the introduction to the 1790 Index Latham complained of what
Gmelin had done and it is apparent that he reluctantly accepted
most, but not all, of Gmelin's names. With increasing competition
from other publications, I hardly think Latham would allow himself
to have his names usurped a second time. Both versions of the
second supplement were clearly intended to be published in 1801 and
the easier to produce Latin version would have appeared first,
while the English version was delayed (most probably due to the
production and printing of plates). I think the English version was
the only one announced by the Royal Society because it was more
expensive to produce and the publishers were keen for a return on
their investment, and also because the source of the Latin names
came out after the Latin version.</p>

<p>The 1801 text is full of new discoveries from Australia, even
with competition from others, notably the works of George Shaw, and
delays could have cost Latham priority for some of them.</p>

<p>In my opinion, I don't understand how a date change has been
accepted without any proof to justify the change.</p>

<p>[END M. BRUCE]</p></li>
<li>Additional thoughts from Murray Bruce (2003.05.17):<pre>
A paper I sought to use when working on the bird classification history
turned up too late.  This is W.L. Sclater's excellent little historical
overview of early African ornithology published in the Hartert Festschrift
(<cite>J. f. O.</cite> 1929).  In a concluding section on Latham he stated: "His first
work 'A General Synopsis' was issued in three volumes with two supplements
between 1781 and 1802" and a little later "In a second work 'Index
Ornithologicus' in two volumes published in 1790 with a supplement issued in
1801".  This distinction between the two is clearer in older sources and I
think the confusion for some has been because they were often bound together
and obviously connected by subject.

</pre></li>
<li>Murray Bruce has continued to send additional arguments and indications in favor of 1801 <i>contra</i>
1802, and on long reflection I remain undecided (2003.05.17). The ICZN Code certainly does
not seem to settle the case. A literal reading of the Code would suggest that <b>any</b> evidence against
the specified publication date, would render that date invalid irrespective of the quality or character of
the evidence.

<li>As I see it, in the abscence of proof that <b>both</b> the Latin, and the English versions of the Supplement
were delayed until 1802, it is appropriate to defer to the imprint date of 1801. 
The <b>probability</b> that both Latin and English versions were delayed until 1802, given only 
that we know for sure that the English version was delayed, can not be established, and 
the imprint date.</li>

<!-- 2010.07.17 <li>The General Synopsis appears to be established as published in 1802. And if this fact
is accepted <i>ad argumentum</i> then the question of the dating of Suppl.Ind.Orn. turns on

To support the idea of a date of 1801 for Suppl.Ind.Orn. and accept a date of 1802 for the

	original material):
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/cit/RI/SP/Pass/pass00751a.jpg"

<li>Spelt <strong><i>levaillantoides</i></strong>, understandably,
in many locations.</li>

<li>My interpretation is that <i>levaillantoides</i> is an
unjustified emendation. Not all agree with this.</li>

<li>This is an example of a name which might be approached by the ICZN
Prevailing Usage "concept". If so, this should be fun to watch. Prevailing
usage is defined as 
<pre> "Of a name: that usage of the name which is adopted by at least a
substantial majority of the most recent authors concerned with the
relevant taxon, irrespective of how long ago their work was
published."</pre>
So it needs to be established and presented <ol>
<li>That the "authors" in question are "published"</li>
<li>That the proposed authors "concerned" with the taxon.</li>
<li>That they are the "most recent"</li>
<li>That their number constitutes a <b>substantial</b> majority (which in
itself is undefined, but clearly a <b>simple</b> majority will in no way
suffice -- if it had they would have used that explicit terminology).</li>
</ol>
<li>I presume that these data will require formal presentation and
publication, and that simply the "considered opinion" or "estimation" of
some concerned individual would not suffice.</li>
<li>This barrier is sufficiently high, that for birds (at least) it is
tantamount to establishing "original spelling" as the requirement.</li>
<br>

2013.04.06
<li>Another, deeper problem exists with this name. The nominate (<i>Scleroptila levaillantoides</i> (A. Smith) 1836) is junior to one of the component supspecies (<i>Scleroptila levaillantoides gutturalis</i> (Ruppell) 1835) which it seems
should be the nominate form.</li>

Botaurus lentiginosus a <strong>Author</strong>
<ul>

<li>HBW <b>1</b>:428 gives Montagu as the author of this taxon, as
does (I am told) the recent Heron Handbook.</li>
<li> Montagu was given as the author by the AOU CL 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (1931), and
changed to Rackett in the AOU CL 5<sup>th</sup> ed. (1957), and has remained
so in subsequent editions.</li>
<li>Peters <b>1</b>(2):243 also lists Rackett.</li>
<li>No mention of the issue of authorship is made in HBW.</li>
<li>I presume that the AOU changed <b>from</b> Montagu <b>to</b> Rackett on the
basis of some positive information, and thus I follow the AOU here.</li>
<li>Alan Knox; Historic Collections; University of Aberdeen King's College; Aberdeen
very helpfully provided more information on this (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.06.02).<br>

<cite>Twenty-eighth Supplement to The American Ornithologists' Union Check-List of
North American Birds. Auk 70 (1953): 359-361.</cite><pre>
<i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i>, formerly accepted as based on <i>Ardea lentiginosa</i>
Montagu, Suppl. Orn. Dict., 1813 (preface dated June), not paged, is now taken from
the earlier description by Rackett of the same specimen: <i>Ardea lentiginosa</i>,
in Pulteney, Cat. Birds, Shells, and some of the more rare Plants of Dorsetshire,
second edition (enlarged), May, 1813, p. 14. (Parish of Piddleton, Dorsetshire,
England.) The name will be cited as <i>Botaurus lentiginosus</i> (Rackett), with the
reference as given above. See Macdonald and Grant, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, vol. 71,
no. 5, June 22, 1951, p. 30.</pre></li>

<li>In turn, Macdonald and Grant's 1951 paper shows that the problem turns upon
establishing priority for the two publications. Macdonald and Grant indicate that
internal evidence suggests Montagu's work has priority, other evidence suggests that
Rackett's work was published first.<ol>
	<li>Rackett's work states (p.14) <pre>Mr Montagu has obligingly communicated the
description of this new species.</pre> and he refers to Monatgu's "Supplement"</li>
	<li>However, the fly leaf of the copy of Rackett's work that is held in the
	library of the Linnean Society has an inscription in Rackett's handwriting,
	dated "May 24th, 1813".</li>
	<li>The Introduction to Montagu's work is dated June 1813, so it appears
	Rackett's work has priority.</li>

<p>Lophornis <strong>Nomenclature</strong></p>

<p>Normand David writes an explanatory note (2001.04.28):</p>

<p><b>Lophornis</b> spelling</p>

<p>The Greek noun <i>ornis</i> [bird] is masculine as well as
feminine (Liddell &amp; Scott 1996, Greek-English Lexicon).
Accordingly, names ending in <i>-ornis</i> do not end in a
transliterated Greek word of fixed gender (ICZN 1999, Art. 30.1.2),
but end in a word of common gender (ICZN 1999, Arts. 30.1,
30.1.4.2). ICZN (1999, Art. 30.1.2, Examples) stated that
"<i>Ichthyornis</i>, ending in <i>-ornis</i> (ornis), is
masculine", but examples "do not form part of the legislative text
of the Code" (ICZN 1999, Art. 89.2). Actually, <b>Ichthyornis</b>
Marsh, 1872, is <b>masculine</b> because it was established in
combination with <i>dispar</i> (a Latin adjective not indicative of
a particular gender) not because it ends in <i>-ornis</i>.</p>

<p>A name that is or ends in a Latin or Greek word of common gender
is feminine only when it is established in combination with one or
more feminine Latin or latinized adjectives; it must be treated as
masculine in all other situations (ICZN 1999, Arts. 30.1, and
30.1.4.2).</p>

<p>Indeed, <b>Anthornis</b> Gray, 1840, which was established in
combination with the feminine latinized adjectives <i>melanura</i>
and <i>caeruleocephala</i>, is presently treated as feminine (as
per Peters 1964, etc.), and <b>Torreornis</b> Barbour &amp; Peters,
1927, which was established in combination with the feminine Latin
adjective <i>inexpectata</i>, is also treated as feminine (as per
AOU 1998, etc.).</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<p><b>Lophornis</b> Lesson, 1829, was established <b>without a name
in combination</b> [Lesson listing seven species names in
combination with <b>Ornismya</b>], and is thus
<b>MASCULINE</b>.</p>

<p>Consequently HBW 5 has the correct spellings for the adjectival
names combined with <b>Lophornis</b>.</p>

<strong>Spelling</strong> 
<ul>
<li>N.J. Collar HBW <b>3</b>:263 spells this man's name "Le
Mahout".</li>

<li>I understand this man to be Emmanuel Le Maout [1800-1877].</li>

<li>He is listed as "Le Maout" in the Catalogue of the Books of the
British Museum, and his name is spelt "Le Maout" on the title page
of works such as:

<strong>Spelling</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Originally spelt "Lipa<b>n</b>gus" by Boie.</li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:293 (Zimmer) includes a note
indicating 
<ul>
<li>'The cited classical derivation,
"&lambda;&iota;&pi;&alpha;&upsilon;&gamma;&sigma;&sigmaf;  = splendore
deficiens," indicates a correctible error. --  J.T.Z.'</li>
<li>The subject of "correctible errors" is not inappropriate here, as the
Greek orthography in this volume of Peters appears to have been a
challenge for the M.C.Z. press. Their rendering of the Greek appears
problematic on two accounts.<ul>
	<li>The attempt at the Greek letter &upsilon; looks clearly like the
	use of a lower case Gothic "u" to appear &upsilon;-like.</li>
	<li>Even accepting the attempt at rendering the upsilon, the word
	appears to be spelled incorrectly -- as written it ends in two
	sigma's, the usual sigma and the final sigma. The Greek word in fact
	is &lambda;&iota;&pi;&alpha;&upsilon;&gamma;&eta;&sigmaf; [=deserted
	by light, dark, sunless; blind]
	In the Richmond Index, this is rendered
	&lambda;&iota;&pi;&alpha;&upsilon;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf;
	</ul>
	</ul>

<li>The Richmond index cites Cabanis Arch. fur Naturgesch. 1847
Band I p.233 (footnote) for the initial emendation.</li>

<li>Normand David has investigated this matter further and writes (2005.12.09):<pre>

I had the opportunity to take a look at Boie 1828 (Isis, p. 318)

The original is <b>Lipangus</b> [sic], with a footnote that reads: "Lipangos, splendore
deficiens". Lipangos is written with Greek letters. The difference between "n" and "u" is slight
but visible. The Greek word "lipangos" does not exist, but there is the adjective lipanges
[dark, deserted by light; =the Latin splendore deficiens/lacking light].

Is the error correctible under 32.5.1? Meaning that we have an inadvertent error as indicated by
internal information in the OD. A purist would say that <b>Lipauges</b> should be the correct
form of the genus. Others would argue that Boie thought that <i>lipaugos</i> was the classical
Greek form, that he latinized correctly,  but inadvertently with "n" instead of "u" both in
Greek and in Latin.

One thing for sure, if the spelling <b>Lipaugus</b> is not accepted as a justified emendation of
"Lipangus", it is an unjustified emendation in prevailing usage.

Note that the name is cited <b>Lipaugus</b> Boie 1828 -not <b>Lipaugus</b> Cabanis 1847
(33.2.3)-; and now, under 33.2.3.1, when an unjustified emendation is in prevailing usage AND is
attributed to the original author and date, it is deemed to be a justified emendation!

Well, as far as I can <i>SEE</i>,  <b>Lipaugus</b> it is, no matter how!
