Campylorhynchus rufinucha xerophilus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:634 lists this taxon without putting the authority
	in parentheses.</li>
	<li>Griscom, however, described this as <i>Heleodytes capistratus xerophilus</i> 
	(Am.Mus.Novit. <b>414</b>:7), so parentheses are appropirate for the authority.</li>

Pachycephala pectoralis xanthoprocta <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:23 (Mayr 1967) give this citation as:<pre>
<i>Pectoralis xanthoprocta</i> Gould, 1838 Synops. Birds 
Australia, pt. 3 pl.53</pre>
The Richmond Index gives the plate as "pl.[18]" which I follow.</li>
<li>Sherborn in Index Animalium does not give a plate or other details, 
simply indicating it was published in April of 1838.</li>

<A name="M.xanthogrammaCite"></a>
Melanodera xanthogramma <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>13</b>:109 (Paynter, 1970) to Gray alone as
the author.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index entry has an entry that originally read:<pre>
J. Gould, in C. Darwin</pre> the "J.Gould" is crossed out and "G.R. Gray"
written in above. Richmond correctly dates this name to Nov. 1839.</li>
<li>The entry in the Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus. <b>12</b>:789 is interesting in that it
gives the citation as "p. 196 pl. 23 (1841)", so the page number, plate number,
and year all appear to be wrong.</li>
<li>Steinheimer FD, Dickinson EC, &amp; Walters M. 2006. "<i>The zoolog y of
the voyage of the HMS Beagle Part III. Birds</i>: new avian names, their
authorship and their dates." BBOC <b>126</b>:(3):171-193, discusses this
question in detail. They conclude that Gould &amp; Gray stand as co-authors
for this taxon.</li>

<A name="P.p.xanthopygeNomen" id="P.p.xanthopygeNomen"></a>
Pardalotus punctatus xanthopyge <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several interesting points arise regarding this name. The details are well provided by Murray
Bruce (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.08.14).<pre>
I can fill you in on this one.  Salomonsen in Peters <b>XII</b>: 203 also cited a paper by Hindwood,
1950, Emu <b>49</b>:207 [= 205-208].  Hindwood's article was on the attempted 'multiple christening'
of this pardalote.

Apparently, Ramsay had written a description of the new bird on 10 December, to be called
<i>Pardalotus chrysoprymna</i>, but changed to <i>P. leadbeateri</i> before he sent it to ZSL for
publication in PZS.  It was read to the society but by then he was aware of McCoy's description so
he withdrew his paper.

McCoy had learnt of Ramsay's planned description so he rushed his into the Melbourne newspaper
(McCoy was at the museum in Melbourne, while Ramsay was his counterpart in Sydney) while also
sending it for publication in England.  Interestingly, Hindwood's article has much detail, mostly
from Ramsay's papers, but he does not seem to have actually seen the newspaper article or he would
have provided more details of it.

I have a copy.  He is listed as M'Coy and his short article is entitled "On a new Victorian species
of Diamond Bird".  As his focus was all about beating Ramsay, the description of <i>broadbenti</i>
was not part of this bit of skulduggery.

The newspaper is called 'The Australasian' and if Hindwood had seen it he could have added the
detail that it is vol. 1, no. 39, p. 1221.  Of greater significance is the fact that the name was
spelled '<i>xanthopyge</i>', not <i>xanthopygus</i>, as in Ann. Mag. NH.

I think there is a partial facsimile elsewhere in Emu because the adjacent column on the same page
is an article featuring the original description of <i>Casuarius Johnsonii</i> by F. Mueller [note
'ii' as Mueller was a botanist and well versed in Latin, of course].  This was featured in a paper
on the early history of the cassowary in Australia but  I don't recall where it is without digging
around but that can wait at the moment.  There also was a facsimile in this article of the earlier
description in a newspaper by Wall, who named it <i>australis</i>.</pre>

<hr><A name="G.p.xerophilusCite" id="G.p.xerophilusCite"></a>
Gallirallus philippensis xerophilus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cited by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:120 to van Bemmel &amp; Hoogerwerf 1940</li>
<li>Cited by HBW <b>3</b>:163,[725] to van Bemmel &amp; Hoogerwerf 1941</li>
<li>The Richmond Index cites this name to van Bemmel alone (noting that A. Hoogerwerf
collected the specimen Aug. 9, 1938), and indicates that the name is in Afl.5, with a date
of Dec, 1940.</li>
<li>So there is disagreement with regards the authority and the date. Although I have some 
question as to Hoogerwerf's standing in the authority, I will follow H&amp;M
3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>
unless further details become available.</li>

<hr><A name="X.xanthocephalusCite" id="X.xanthocephalusCite"></a>
Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus <strong>citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>The citation is conventionally given to the J.Acad.Nat.Sci.Phila. The date for the portion 
in which this is published is given as "Feb. 1826".</li>
<li>The Richmond Index indicates that the description was also read Jan. 24, 1826 
for the Ann.Lyc.Nat.Hist.N.Y., though the date when it was published there (vol. II p.52) is uncertain.
If it antedates the Philadelphia publication, it would be the source to cite.</li>
<li>The dates of publication of the Ann.Lyc.Nat.Hist.N.Y. are a mystery and a problem, and it is likely
that certainty regarding the dates of publication may never be ours. The citation is best left to the
Philadelphia publication, unless additional information becomes available.</li>
<li>This potential problem is not discussed in the AOU CL's or in Peters Checklist.</li>

Stiphrornis <strong>xanthogaster  </strong>

<li>The paper by <cite>Pamela Beresford and Joel Cracraft. "Speciation in
Forest Robins (Stiphrornis): Species Limits, Phylogenetic
Relationships, and Molecular Biogeography." 1999.
Am.Mus.Novit. 3270. p.1-22</cite> evidently holds that
<b>Stiphrornis</b> must be split into two species.</li>

Thanks to Norbert Bahr for bringing this to my attention.
