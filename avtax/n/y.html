Pycnonotus goiavier yourdini <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Originally spelled <i>Yourdini</i>.</li>
	<li>Subsequently most authors spell this <i>gourdini</i> though they are unwilling or unable to give any justification or
	rationale for this emendation.</li>
	<li>[2019.02.14]: The "rationale" used is "prevailing usage" though I am unaware of anyone, anywhere undertaking and publishing the analysis to support this position. Rather it appears more an "opinion" which self appointed savants think is "good enough".</li>
	<li>I find the current jack-boot process of "literary cleansing" distasteful enough, but draw the line at 
		non-literature supported assertions of "prevailing usage".<li>

Anthreptes reichenowi yokanae <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:210 (= Rand 1967) gives the author as Hartert, and this was initially
	followed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:704; Corrigenda 2.1 
	says<pre>author van Someren not Hartert.</pre></li>
	<li>What basis, one wonders, is there for this change? The facts are these:<ol>
		<li>The text of the article in question reads:<pre>
  D<small>R.</small> E<small>RNST</small> H<small>ARTERT</small> exhibited a new Sunbird, which he
described as follows, on behalf of Dr. V.G.L. van Someren:-
	<b>Anthreptes yokanae</b>, sp. nov. </pre> [description follows]. <b>Note</b>: no attribution to
	van Someren associated with the "sp. nov." text.</li>
	<li>The relevant portion of the Code states:<pre>
 50.1.1. However, if it is clear from the contents that some person other than an 
author of the work is alone responsible both for the name or act and for 
satisfying the criteria of availability other than actual publication, 
then that other person is the author of the name or act. If the identity 
of that other person is not explicit in the work itself, then the author 
is deemed to be the person who publishes the work.</pre></li>
	</ol>
	
<li>So, is it "clear from the contents that" [van Someren] and not [Hartert] "is alone
responsible...."? I think not. van Someren's role is not fully defined here.</li>
<li>Additionally I note that in the description of the <b>next</b> species in this article 
(<i>Phyllastrephus rabai</i> p.64) the text starts out:<pre>
  D<small>R.</small> E<small>RNST</small> H<small>ARTERT</small> also exhibited a Green Bulbul of the
genus <i>Phyllastraphus</i>, which was described by Dr. van Someren and himself as follows:--
	<b>Phyllastraphus rabai</b> Hart. &amp; van Som. sp. nov. </pre> [description follows].
<b>Note</b>: van Someren explicitly place by Harter in the authority.</li>

<li>Therefore, I interpret the Code to require the authority for <i>yokanae</i>  to be given to Hartert. Not all
agree with this.</li>

Melanocorypha yeltoniensis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Conventionally cited to 1767, which is the imprint date for this volume of the
Philos.Trans.; Vol 57 is the "December" volume of the Transactions.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index has a note indicating that this was published in 1768, which prompted
further investigation.</li>
<li>Forster's paper (pp.312-357) <pre><b>XXXIII.</b> <i>Specimen Hi&#383;toriae Naturalis Vol-
gen&#383;is. Auctore</i> J. R. For&#383;ter</pre> notes at the beginning 
(p.312) <pre>Read June 18, 1767 </pre> and at
the end of the article (p.357) 
notes <pre>Dabam Londini, die xxvii Febr. anni 1767</pre></li>
<li>However, the final paper (pp.517-536) in this volume notes 
(p.517) <pre>Title read December 17, 1767</pre> but it notes that the paper itself was
<pre>Read Feb. 4, 1768</pre></li>
<li>Therefore, with regards to Forster's paper, a date of 1767 can hold only if it is
demonstrated that the individual articles were published separately prior to publication of
the volume as a whole.</li>
<li>A fundamental lesson is evident in this case. Many workers stress the
importance of examining the original <b>descriptions</b> (though in fact this
is very rarely done). It is however only a half-truth, but is a belief that has
lead many workers badly astray. It is more correct to indicate that the
original <b>work</b> must be examined, as very often there are
indications within the work, but apart from the original description itself,
that are necessary to a proper understanding of the disposition of the
publication. In literature from the 18<sup><small>th</small></sup>,
19<sup><small>th</small></sup> and early 20<sup><small>th</small></sup>
centuries, often it is necessary to examine multiple copies of "the work"
to understand the true state of affairs.</li>
<li>Subsequent to the work noted above, I (belatedly) look this name up in
Sherborn's Index Animalium. Sherborn dates this to 1768 which appers to lend
considerable support to the use of that date.</li>
<li>[2010.11.08] Sadly these difficulties have been compounded by the ICZN.
In their "Official Lists and Indexes of Names and Works in Zoology" (1987) they place the
name on the official list, but don't spell the specific epithet correctly. They employ
the spelling <i>yeltonensis</i> -- a spelling actually employed in 1801 by Georg Suckow
(a fact of which we must presume they are ignorant).
The spelling used by Forster was <i>yeltoniensis</i>, so added to the problem
is the error in the ICZN Official List.</li>

Psaricolius bifasciatus yuracares <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>14</b>:143 (Blake) to Lafresnaye
&amp; d'Orbigny.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small>:769 lists the authority in the opposite order, as d'Orbigny
&amp; Lafresnay. The standard of H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small> seems to demand that others justify
the tiniest departure from citations as given by the Peters checklist. A requirement that H&amp;M
3<small><sup>rd</sup></small> does not appear to meet itself. H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small> may
justify this "departure from Peters" somewhere, but I certainly can't find it.</li>
<li>The order d'Orbigny &amp; Lafresnaye is that given by the Richmond Index, which is the justification I
use for the order that I employ.</li>

Myiarchus yucatanensis <strong>Citation</strong>

on p.19 the list the volume number for a bird (<i>Empidonax atrirostris</i>

<li>Volume <b>23</b> makes sense for the volume for 1871.</li>

<li>The Richmond index in the entry for <i>Emberizoides macrourus

<li>Bowdler Sharpe in the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum.
vol.23, spells the specific epithet "yp<b>a</b>caha" both in the
species listing and the citation.</li>

<li>Sherborn lists a "Rallus yp<b>a</b>caha" C. Dumont. Dict. Sci.

Carduelis yarrellii <strong>Nomenclature</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>14</b>:240 (Howell, Paynter, and Rand)
gives the authors name in parentheses "(Audubon)", and lists a synonomy: <ul>
	<li><i>Fringilla mexicana</i> Audubon, Ornith.Biogr., <b>5</b>, p. 282, pl.
	433, fig. 4 -- "Upper California." Not <i>Carduelis mexicanus</i> Swainson,
	1827.</li>

	<li><i>Carduelis yarrellii</i> Audubon, 1839, Syn. Birds. N. Amer.  p. 117 --
	"Upper California" [error]; Bahia, Brazil, designated by Todd, 1926, Ann.
	Carnegie Mus., <b>17</b>, p.32</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The synonomy in the Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. 12 p.198 is similar,
differing in that the name is spelled with one "i", as
<i>yarrelli</i>.</li>

<li>Cabanis &amp; Heine Mus. Heineanum Th.1 p.159 list this taxon
in <b>Astralginus</b> which they erect there. They spell the
