Glossoptilus <strong>Authority</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Cited by many to Rothschild and Hartert (<i>e.g.</i> IOC 11.2; Joseph <i>et al.</i>2020).</li>
	<li>This is understandable as the article containing this name/lapsus is indeed by those
		two men.</li>
	<li>However, at the beginning of the article on p.530 nomeclatural responsibility is assigned
		to Rothschild for some groups and Hartert for the rest. Parrots are not in the groups
		assigend to Rothschild.</li>
	<li><a class="" href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/22554#page/578/mode/1up" target="new">Assignation of responsibilities</a>
	<li>My interpretation is that this name should be attributed to Hartert. Richmond appears
		to have thought so as well, judging for his card for this genus group name.</li>
	<li><a class="" href="http://www.zoonomen.net/cit/RI/Genera/G/g00297a.jpg" target="new">Richmond Index

	<li>Also note that Peters <b>III</b>:152 cites the name to p.552. It appears to me that p.5<b>3</b>2 is correct.

<A id="P.gularisNomenclature"></a>
<ul>
	<li>Long cited to Oberholser 1918 with the specific epithet <i>epia</i> /<i>epius</i>.</li>
	<li>See David, Elliott, &amp; Bruce. 2021 BBOC <b>141</b>:50-58 for an excellent
		discussion of this name, and an example of how consideration of 
		"prevaling usage" should be undertaken.</li>

	<li><a href="https://boc-online.org/bulletins/downloads/BBOC1411-PDFa.pdf" target=new> David, Elliott, & Murray article pdf</a></li>
	<li>Author's who simply take a position that something represents "prevailing usage", and take that position without data supporting and documenting their evaluative study should be (at minimum) ignored. Such pronouncments generally speak to the individual experience of the person making the statment. No doubt this experience is interesting and important to them, but by itself and without context is of limited value, and less interest more generally. It is a numerator without a denominator.</li>

<A id="P.g.gourdiniNomen" name="P.g.gourdiniNomen"></a>
Pycnonotus goiavier gourdini <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Originally spelled <i>Yourdini</i>, an incontrovertible truth.</li>
	<li>Subsequently most authors spell this <i>gourdini</i> though they have been unwilling or 
	unable to give any justification or rationale for this emendation.</li>
	<li>[2019.02.14]: The "rationale" subsequently given is "prevailing usage" 
		though I am unaware of anyone, anywhere undertaking and publishing the analysis 
		to support this position. Rather it appears more an "opinion" which self appointed and 
		self-important savants think is "good enough". In this, they quite clearly are taking a
		break from being scientists, but have donned the robes of high priests issuing fiats, bulls
		and fatwas.</li>
	<li>My opinion of this kind of action has been quite low, <b>very</b> low, in fact.  But I am changing
		my mind. Such actions, which necessarily  degrade the inherent quality of the information
		must be recognized as a useful indicator of the inherently non-scientific process at play.</li>

Trachylaemus purpuratus goffinii <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The authority is often attributed to Schlegel 
	(<i>e.g.</i> Peters Checklist <b>6</b>:60; CBBM <b>19</b>:106 (=Shelley 1891);
	HBW <b>7</b>:175 (2002).</li>
	<li>However, the livraison where this is named and described is by Goffin, and 
	there is no indication that Schlegel was responsible for the description.
	Schlegel's name is listed following the name. It may well be that Schlegel provided
	the name as a manuscript name, but his role in the matter is not stated or defined.
	Therefore, I attribute the name to the author of the work, which in this case is
	Goffin.</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>I</b>(2):551 (= Amadon 1979) cites this to "col. 143",

	<li>The genus is introduced in cols. 43, and 183.</li>
	<li>HBW <b>2</b>:573 (1994) does not allow for the identification of individual

<A name="P.greyiNomenclature" id="P.greyiNomenclature"></a>
Ptilinopus greyi <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This name is spelled, almost universally with a double -ii ending (<i>greyii</i>).</li>
	<li>Examination of the original work (on-line http://nat.pictura-dp.nl)
		shows the original spelling to be <i>greyi</i> both on the plate
		and in the text.</li>
	<li>Usually in cases such as this, the emendation results from authors following
	the CBBM, but remarkably in this instance CBBM <b>21</b>:85 spells the name
	"Ptilinopus greyi", with the single -i ending! However confusion is added by
	the synonomy listing where the original description by Bonaparte is listed
	(with others) as "Ptilinopus greyii".</li>
	<li>In the original description, the only individuals mentioned in the text are
	named Gr<b>a</b>y, but as the name is cited to the plate, this fact may have no
	bearing on the matter.

Turdus rubrocanus gouldii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>	
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>X</b>:200 (= Ripley 1964) gives the spelling as
       <pre><i>Merula Gouldi</i></pre> 
	and this is followed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:669 
	(through Corrigenda 8).</li>
	<li>There is no question that the name was originally spelled with an -ii ending, as shown
	in the Richmond Index <a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/cit/RI/SP/Merg/merg00364a.jpg"
	target="new">Richmond Index card Merula gouldii</a>.</li>

	<li>Interestingly, in their discussion of 
	"The authorship and date of <i>Turndu rubrocanus</i>" 
	(SNAB 56. Dickinson EC &amp; Walters M. 2006), the specific epithet is also spelled
	with the incorrect single -i ending.</li>
	<li>HBW <b>10</b>:649 also employs the incorrect <i>-i</i> ending.</li>

Gymnoris <strong>Citation</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Substantial confusion surrounds the citation of this genus regarding

	<li>I follow Gregory SMS. 2006. "Systematic notes on Asian birds. 
	57. The authorship of the generic name <i>Gymnoris</i>."
	Zoologische Mededelingen. Leiden 80-5 (December 2006).</li>
	<li>Of note, H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> Corrigenda 6 cites Hodgson
	rather than Blyth, and 1844 rather than 1845, and then in Corrigenda 8 refers
	to Gregory's article, but does not appear to change either the author or the date
	for this taxon. The note that reads "Re above see Gregory (2006) [SNAB 57]." may
        imply that Gregory's approach is to be followed.</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:305 (= Deignan 1964) list this in vol.<b>14</b> of BBOC and dates this to "1930". Clearly this is a transcription error for the correct date, which is 1903.</li>

	livr.1 no.4 Astures p.23,24</li></ul></li>
<li>In van den Hoek Ostende LW, Dekker RWRJ, &amp; Keijl GO. 1997. "Type-specimens of birds
in the National Museum of Natural History, Leiden. Part 1. Non-Passerines." 
NNM Tech.Bull.  <b>1</b>:1-248, the authors indicate (p.22) that "This name is usually, 
but incorrectly, attributed to Schlegel (1862c)". They cite "(Kaup, 1848)".</li>
<li>Their references list (p.195) appears to have a problem of its own.
The reference reads: "Kaup, J., 1848. Zusage zu dem Genus <i>Astur</i>. -- Isis (Oken) 26:774."
The number "26" does not seem to me to be possible for the volume of 1848. 
My tally of volumes indicates that
this would be in volume "41", and I have a number of Kaup citations to 1848 and volume 41.
In his history of the journal Isis von Oken, Kertesz GA. 1986. Isis <b>77</b>(3):497-503
refers (p.503) to "<i>Isis von Oken</i>, 1844, <i>37</i>, cols. 49ff." which further
supports the idea that the volume number "26", as proposed by van den Hoek Ostende 
<i>et al.</i>, is an error.</li>
<li>The other parts of the citation look adequately appropriate that they seem reasonable 
to accept, though I am a little hesitant, not being able to otherwise confirm a citation that
itself does not appear to have been carefully reviewed.</li>
<li>In his Corrigenda no.8 for H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>, Dickinson refers to
van den Hoek Ostende as  van de<u>r</u> Hoek Ostende.</li>

	<li>This spelling difference goes un-noted in the AOU CL 1957 (p.489); Peters CL <b>14</b>:16 (1968); or
	Deignan (1961) (p.531,532).</li>

<A name="A.m.griseigularisNomen" id="A.m.griseigularisNomen"></a>
Anthreptes malacensis griseigularis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This bird, like many sunbirds, was described in <b>Anthothreptus</b> a name generally
	held to be a Cabanis emendation of Swainson's name <b>Anthreptes</b>.
	Some confusion results from the fact that Gadow in CBBM <b>8</b> uses <b>Anthothreptes</b> as the genus
	name and does not appear to regard it as an emendation.</li>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:209 (= Rand 1967) amplifies confusion with an error of his own.
	Rand lists:<pre>
	<i>Anthreptes</i> Swainson, 1832, in Swainson and Richardson, 
		Fauna Bor. Amer., <b>2</b> (1831) , p. 495.
	...
	<i>Anthothreptes</i> Swainson, 1837, Class. Birds, <b>2</b>, p.329.</pre>
	Which is incorrect, but creates the impression that Swainson erected or treated <b>Anthothreptes</b>
	as a genus group name in its own right. If true this would require the use of parentheses around
	authorities for taxa described in <b>Anthothreptes</b> but now held in <b>Anthreptes</b>.
	Rand's reference is nonesense, Swainson's p.329 of Class. Birds <b>2</b> has no use of <b>Anthothreptes</b>
	as can be seen here:
	<a href="./pic/SwNHB_2_p329.PDF" target="new">Swainson's Nat. Hist. Birds 2 p.329</a></li>
	<li>[2010.11.29] Gastone Rabascini helpfully points out, that I had not spelled the genus group name <b>Anthothreptus</b> correctly,
	and more importantly Sundevall used the name (<b>Anthothreptus</b>) in 1872, apparently as an emendation of Swainson's name (<b>Anthreptes</b>).

<li>Peters Checklist <b>11</b>:503 (= Mayr 1986) has 1885</li>
<li>{Richmond, et al. 1992} has 1884 and a note "July or later".</li> 
<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:234 cites <i>Geoffroyus geoffroyi timarlaoensis</i>

citreogularis kisserensis</i> from p.41 of the work to 1885. However, all these names
are in Heft 1 of the Sitzungberichte.</li> 
<li>Presumably 1884 is the date specified (imprint date) on Heft 1 of the work. Thus
it appears to me that in abscence of <b>proof</b> of delay, 1884 is to be
followed.</li> 
<li>H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small> initially followed Peters Checklist and its
inconsistencies in this matter without comment. However starting with Corrigenda 6,

Dicrurus hottentottus guillemardi <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul> 
<li>Commonly cited to 1890 which may very well be correct.</li>
<li>This material, which apparently was issued in two forms, with different pagination, and
seemingly different dates of availability, is very troublesome and confusing. This difficulty
is increased by the fact that there appears to be little recognition of the problem and the
possibilities of 1889 <i>vs</i> 1890.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index is usually helpful in this matter, but in this instance has only one
card, which lists the two versions of publication, but in this instance (contrasting with
others) lists only the 1890 date.</li>
<li>My citation, which should be considered provisional, includes "pt.1" following the
Richmond Index. This makes it seem almost certain to me that the date must be 1889, and not
1890. The page number I provide for the Aggiunte  ("p.94") is given by
Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:151, but is <b>not</b> given in the Richmond Index. 
<li>Consistency in the format of these citations does not seem to be found (including in the
Richmond Index) and my listings are my best attempt to accomadate the various citations I have
found.</li>

<li>Mayr's citation is problematic. Volume <b>16</b> of this Journal was not published until 1847, so
it appears that Mayr was confused or misinformed.</li>

[<i>Buteo (Rupornis) magnirostris</i>] var. <i>griseocauda</i> Ridgway,

This date (1873) is

<li>The Richmond Index gives the date as 1874, which I follow.</li>
<li>For this Journal volume, 1874 appears more likely than 1873; volume 14
(for 1871) was
not published (at least the latter portions) until 1872. Volumes often extended
across more than one year, and it appears delays were common. This bird is described
in part I of volume 16, and volume 17 came out in 1875, so 1874 appears 
likely.</li>
<li>The Harry Harris compilation of Ridgways publication (Condor
<b>30</b>:73-74) dates these pages (pp.43-72, Appendix, pp.73-106) to
December, 1873,; The Richmond Index for <b>Rhynchofalco</b> (from p.46 of
this serial) says "Sig. dated <u>Nov. 1873</u>". Though the Richmond card
indicates that the imprint date for Part I of this volume is "1874".</li>
<li>I can not exclude the possibility that this portion of the serial came
out in 1873, but as the imprint date seems to be "1874" I use that as the

conventionally spelled <i>groenvoldi</i> (e.g. H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:149;
HBW <b>3</b>:645).</li>
<li>The substitution of the <i>-&ouml;-</i> by <i>-oe-</i> in this
instance implies either uncertainty about the derivation of the word, or
the belief that it is based on a word of German origin.</li>
<li>The ICZN Code 1999 Art. 32.5.2.1 states:<pre>
In the case of a diacritic or other mark, the mark concerned is deleted, except that in a name
published before 1985 and based upon a German word, the umlaut sign is deleted from a vowel and
the letter "e" is to be inserted after that vowel (if there is any
doubt that the name is based upon a German word, it is to be so treated).</pre></li>
<li>Clearly this bird is named for Henrik Gr&ouml;nvold, or
Gr&oslash;nvold.  Dr David Donsker informs me (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.01.07)
that Henrik Gr&oslash;nvold was the illustrator for Mathews's Birds of
Australia, and was Danish.</li>
<li>I do not find any German word or words that correlates with
Gr&ouml;vold, and find only Scandinavian correlates.</li>
<li>If the rules of the ICZN Code 1999 are to be heeded, this
must be spelled <i>gronvoldi</i>.</li>
<li>Normand David offers his current iterpretation (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.01.14):<pre>
Art. 32.5.2.1 does not expressly ask that the origin (German or non-German) of a name be stated in the
original description. In other words, all sources of information can be used to apply the rule. 

I feel that D.Donsker provide enough information to conclude that Gr&ouml;nvold is not a German name, and
that the correct spelling of gr&ouml;nvoldi Mathews 1912 is gronvoldi under 32.5.2.1 -the spelling used by
H&M 2 under the 1985 Code.

At this moment, I see that Blake (1979, Neotropical Birds) and HBW <b>3</b>:645 have "groenvoldi", both
being Incorrect subsequent spellings. Perhaps an Unjustified emendation was also introduced somewhere -the
Hellmayr series or a Brazilian reference such as Pinto may provide a clue. But, wether an ISS or an UE, we
are again faced with the "prevailing usage" issue, the assessment of which has yet to be
completed.</pre></li>

Ptilinopus ornatus gestroi <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Two issues here: the order of the authors, and whether the authority should be listed in
parentheses.</li>
<li>Regarding the order in which the authors are listed I follow the Richmond Index, which
lists the authors explicitly in this order for this taxon. The card prepared is such that it
would have been easier to list the authors in the other order, so I interpret that this order
represents a conscious decision on Richmond's part.  While I do not have the material to hand
to address the facts of the matter, it is unlikely that Richmond was <b>less</b> careful with
regard to this matter than other workers have been.</li>

<li>[2020.08.14] Colin Jones confirms that the order Albertis &amp; Salvadori is seen in the original.</li>

<li>Regarding the need for placing the authority in parentheses, the taxon was described in
<b>Ptilonopus</b> (<i>c.f.</i> <b>Ptilinopus</b>), a name evidently first used by Selby in
1833 for the Swainson 1825 name. (Swainson himself used <b>Ptilinapus</b> in 1837,
further confusing the matter).
So the question becomes is <b>Ptilonopus</b> simply an emendation of <b>Ptilinopus</b>, 
in which case no parentheses are needed, or is it a genus group name in its own right?
The Richmond Index lists <b>Ptilonopus</b> "Swainson" Selby as an emendation for
<b>Ptilinopus</b> Swainson; Neave says <b>Ptilonopus</b> <i>pro</i> <b>Ptilonopus</b>. So
I interpret one name to be simply an emendation of the other, and thus not
requiring parentheses.</li>

<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:39 lists the authority in parentheses, and this is followed without
comment by H&amp;M 3 <sup>rd</sup>:175.</li>
<li>HBW <b>4</b>:209 lists the authority without parentheses, evidently interpreting

<li>I had originally, and incorrectly, interpreted the two dots above
the "e" to be an umluat. Rainer Massman (2005.08.06) very helpfully
pointed out my error here, and I have learned that he is correct that
formally all "double dots" over a letter are not umlauts (!). Umlauts
designate the partial assimilation to a succeeding sound --
particularly that of a back vowel (a,o,u) caused by a (front) "i" or
"j"  originally standing in the following syllable, but now lost. This
definition would not seem to apply to the "double dot" appearing over
the "e" in this instance, and I am not sure what this diacritical mark
should be called, it is clear that it should be dropped from the
binomen.</li>
<li>Jobling 1991 p.101 suggests that the name is based on "Gr. <i>gupaietos</i> a
corrupt version of <i>hupaietos</i>), an eagle or vulture."</li>
<li>Liddell &amp; Scott list

Zenaida galapagoensis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>I find this work bibliographically confusing. Sherborn
(<cite>Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist., 1897 (6) <b>20</b>:483</cite>) gives a listing for
the parts, which by his tally number 19. Zimmer describes the work as issued as
" 5 pts in 3 vols" and later in his work refers to Parts with roman numerals as
high as VI and arabic numbers as high as 15.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:gives this citation as "pt. 9, 1839, p.115;
pt. 15, 1841, pl.46"</li>
<li>The Peters citation does not comport with the Sherborn or Zimmer listings
or the entry in the Richmond Index. Pt.9 (as cited by Peters) according to
Sherborn includes pp.33-56 (<i>c.f.</i> p.115).</li>
<li>The Richmond Index listing says "pt. III, <i>Birds</i>, no.XV, Mch 1841,
115, pl.46". This "pt. III" must be referring to the larger sections in which
this work was published, and the "no.XV" corresponds to what Sherborn calls
"Part 15".</li>
<li>Since the Peters citation does not seem to make sense (although it is
followed by HBW <b>4</b>:612), I follow the Richmond Index implying 1841, not
1839 as in Peters. </li>
<li>Sherborn in Index Animalium also dates this name to 1841.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:166 also follows the Peters citation and uses
1839.</li>

<li>The locality (taken from the <i>Catalogue</i>, not the <i>Adumbratiunculae</i>) is
given as "Cabo de goede Hoop." with a footnote stating:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>'Called "Bloemzuigertje Ronkertje of Kolibrit" in the "Catalogue."'</li>
	</ul>
<li> Data taken from <cite>Sherborn CD. 1905. "The new species of Birds
in Vroeg's Catalogue, 1764." Smiths.Misc.Coll. <b>47</b>(3):334.</cite></li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>5</b>:58 gives the type locality as "(Cape of Good Hope, error =
Surinam, <i>cf.</i> Richmond, Smiths. Misc. Coll., <b>47</b>, 1905, p.344."</li>
<li>The text from Richmond reads:<pre>
This is evidently a hummingbird and not a sunbird.  The 
locality is wrong and should probably be "Surinam."
The description agrees very closely with the species now
called <i>Polytmus thaumantias</i> (L<small>INN&AElig;US</small>, 1766).</pre>
		
<li>Jobling, 1991 p.99 gives the derivation of the name as:
<pre><b>guainumbi</b>  Tupi (Brazilian) Indian 
	name <i>guainumbi</i> or <i>guinambi</i> for a type
	of hummingbird.</pre>
It is interesting that Pallas would use a Brazilian indian name for a bird he felt came from
the Cape of Good Hope. This suggests to me that the name must have been associated with the
specimen, and that Pallas may not have known what it meant.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index cards are of some interest here:</li>
<ul><li>the first card lists the type
locality as '"Cabo de goede Hoop" [=Surinam ?]' [APP -- note the question mark].</li>
<li>The second card gives the description from Vroeg's catalogue as:<pre>
"60 <u>Bloemzuigertje</u>,  <u>Ronkertje</u>, of <u>Kolibrit.</u>, (<u>Guainumbi</u>).
Lin. Sp. o.  De kleur is groenagtig en als vergult.

Muscisaxicola grisea <strong>Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>Treated as a subspecies of <i>M. alpina</i> by Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:171.</li>
<li><cite>Chesser, R. T. 2000. "Evolution in the high Andes: The phylogenetics of Muscisaxicola
ground-tyrants." Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution <b>15</b>:369-380.</cite> Abstract:<br>
"Phylogenetic relationships within the genus <b>Muscisaxicola</b>, a primarily Andean group of
tyrant-flycatchers, were studied using complete sequences of the mitochondrial genes COII and
ND3. Relationships among <b>Muscisaxicola</b> species were found to differ substantially from
those of previous views, suggesting convergence in traditional avian taxonomic characters within
the genus. The 11 species of large, gray, "typical" Muscisaxicola flycatchers (including <i>M.
grisea</i>, newly restored to species status) formed  a distinct clade, consisting of two major
groups: a clade of 6 species breeding primarily in the central Andes and a clade of 5 species
breeding primarily in the southern Andes. The other 2 species traditionally placed in this genus,
<i>M. fluviatilis</i>, an Amazonian species, and <i>M. maculirostris</i>, were both rather
divergent genetically from the typical species, although <i>M. maculirostris</i> may be the
sister taxon to the typical clade. The patterns of sympatry exhibited by <b>Muscisaxicola</b>
species in the high Andes appear to be the consequence of speciation and secondary contact within
regions of the Andes, rather than a result of dispersal between regions. Diversification of the
typical <b>Muscisaxicola</b> species appears to have occurred during the middle and late
Pleistocene, suggesting generally that taxa of the high Andes and Patagonia may have been greatly
influenced by mid-to-late Pleistocene events. There were likely several independent developments
of migration within this genus, but migration is probably ancestral in the southern clade, with
subsequent loss of migration in two taxa.</li>

<ul>
<li>In HBW <b>5</b>:540 Dr. C. Hinkelmann give the date of authority
as 1832.  Peters Checklist <b>5</b>:8 gives a date of 1833.</li>
<li>The publishing history of this work has been  controversial and
confusing. The work can be examined on-line at http://gallica.bnf.fr/ ;
however it must be noted that examining the work there will only
re-inforce an erroneous impression regarding the dates of publication of
the component parts. On the French National Bibliographic site, the work
is presented in "logical" rather than historical sequence; this is
entirely appropriate for non-nomenclatural use of the work. For an
understanding of the publishing <b>history</b> of this work (which is
not the goal or intention of the French National Bibliotheque site) I
have turned to the works of Sherborn, and Zimmer. The Bibliographie de
la France records the dates of publication and availability for this
work and makes it clear that pp.1-112 were published in 1832, and the
remainder in 1833. The Index (confusingly presented <b>first</b> on the
Gallica BNF site) was <b>actually</b> published subsequent to the text,
commencing in the 11<sup>th</sup> or 12<sup>th</sup> Livraison, despite
the imprint date of Dec. 1832.</li>
<li>The correct date for this taxon is 1833, not 1832.</li>

<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:173 f.n. 2 indicates that <i>griseicauda</i> Gray 1856 is "preoccupied by

<li>The paper by Mees 1973 clarifies how this comes about. He applied the Code as it

(ref.<cite> Mees GF 1973 "Once more: the identity and authorship of 
<i>Treron griseicauda</i>." BBOC. <b>93</b>(3):119-120.</cite>).

	<ul>
	<li>Bonaparte's 1864 lists the name as a junior synonym of <i>T. aromaticus</i> (Gmelin) and 
	does not use the name (as noted by the Richmond Index) or include a description.</li>
	<li>The Code (1999) Article 11.6.1 reads:<pre>
	11.6.1 However, if such a name published as a junior synonym had 
	  been treated before 1961 as an available name and either adopted
	  as the name of a taxon or treated as a senior homonym, it is made
	  available thereby but dates from its first publication as a synonym
	...</pre>
	Mees points out that Sims RW & Warren RML 1955 BBOC <b>75</b>:96-97 use 
	<i>griseicauda</i> Bonaparte 1854 as a valid name. Their text at end of article
	reads: <pre>
	In out opinion the nomenclature should be as follow:
		(1) <i>Treron pompadora griseicauda</i> Bonaparte, 1854 (nec of Gray, 1856). &#151;
	Java. Syn. <i>Treron pulverulenta</i> Wallace, 1863.
		(2) Treron pompadora wallacai (Salvadori), 1893. &#151;  Celebes.

	The spelling "<i>wallacai</i>" appears to be a <i>lapsus</i> for <i>wallacei</i>, which

<p>Often a form is separated as a full species:</p>

p.76<br />
HBW 1:192 (1992) regards this as a subspecies, as does AOU CL 7<sup>th</sup>
ed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Normand David's note regarding this issue reads:</p>

<p>"A case has been made for placing <i>Colymbus major</i>
Boddaert, 1783 (= <i>Podiceps major</i>) in the newly established
monotypic genus <b>Podicephorus</b> Bochenski, 1994.</p>

<p><cite>Bochenski, Z. B. 1994. The comparative osteology of grebes
(Aves: Podicipediformes) and its systematic implications. Acta
zool. cracov. 37 (1): 191-346.</cite></p>

<p>The summary reads: "...a revision of the genus <b>Podiceps</b>
is proposed, to the effect that 1) the species "Podiceps" major is
placed in a new monotypic genus <b>Podicephorus</b>, and 2) <i>
Podiceps grisegena grisegena</i> and <i>P. g. holboellii</i> are
restored to their species status".</p>

<p>So it appears on the basis of osteological evidence this is
elevated to full species status.</p>

<p>Note however, that the AOU CL 7<sup>th</sup> ed. notes (p.8) that Storer
1996 Auk 113: 974-975 in a review argues against this split.
Bochenski argued for separation based on his <b>not</b> finding
sexual dimorphism in the Old world form of <i>P. grisgena</i>. It
appears that Bochenski's data were not representative, obtained
from birds far from the breeding grounds. Storer indicates that
sexual dimorphism <b>is</b> found in grebes whenever sufficient
material is available.</p>

<p>In his review he includes raw data, provided by Jon Fjeldsa for
European forms of <i>P. grisgena</i> that appear to strongly
support the idea that sexual dimorphism (felt by Bochenski to be
absent) is present.</p>

<p>Storer in his review lists data (below) from Jon Fjeldsa for
culmen measurements of European <i>P. grisgena</i> obtained on the
breeding gounds (<i>contra</i> the data that Bochenski used, which
was many regions, and often not on the breeding grounds.</p>

<p>The data as presented by Storer are:</p>

<p>Culmen measurements (as presented by Storer):</p>

<p>Kazakhstan &amp; Obj lowlands W. Siberia:<br />
F: 35.1 35.8 36.1 36.2 37.2<br />
M: 40.2 41.6 41.6 43.5<br />

38.2 38.5 38.6<br />

Arkhangelsk and Kola:<br />
F: 38.1 40.1 40.1 40.3<br />
M: 40.2 41.5 41.6 43.2 44.2</p>

<p>These raw data are convincing, and even more convincing is a
boxplot of the data, partitioned by gender.</p>

<center><img src="plot/pgcl.JPG" /></center>

These boxplots include a "notch" that includes the 95% confidance
interval for the median (median location is indicated by the dot).

<p>These specimens are clearly sexually dimorphic with regard to
culmen length.</p>

Concept</strong><br />
A confusing situation here.</a>
<ul>
<li>Not in HBW.. or Peters.</li>

<li>My summary of discussion from Edward C. Dickinson, Michael
Walters, and Normand David:<br />
 There is "widespread" Australian recognition of the race from the
Recherche islands off Western Australia with evident consensus
that this constitutes a species.<br />
Two references seem to have been used for this taxon:

<ul>
<li>Vieillot (1816), based on Vieillot, L.P., 1816. Nouveau
Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle: 5 CAL-CEZ. 1-614., Paris. In
this, on p.516, is found Le C&eacute;reopsis Gris, <i>Cereopsis
cinereus</i>. terra typica is Novae Hollandiae.</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Here (p.516 of vol.5), Vieillot designates
	<b>CEREOPSIS</b>, which he says is an order of "echassiers"
	(long-legged waders). The one species: Le C&eacute;reopsis Gris,
	<i>Cereopsis cinereus</i>,  would appear <b>not</b> to
	be the goose in question,
	and appears to be indeterminate. </li>
	</ul>

<li>Vieillot (1818), based on: Vieillot, L.P., 1818. Nouveau
Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle: 23. NIL-ORC. 1-612. --,
Paris.<br /> </li>
<ul>

		<li>In this 1818 material on p.336 is found L'Oie Grise,
		Vieill. The terra typica is La terre de Di&eacute;men. The
		collector is cited as de Labillardi&egrave;re who took this
		specimen during the voyage of M. de Lapeyrouse. Presuming
		that this implies that it was taken in Tasmania (Van
		Diemen's Land) it would appear to be a synonym
		of <i>novaehollandiae</i> Latham, 1801(2).</li>
	<li>However, p. 336 of vol. 23, is part of a long essay on OIE
(Geese). One of these is: L'oie Grise, <i>Anser griseus</i>,
Vieill. la Terre de Diemen.</li>
</ul>


<li>Thus the name appears to arise from <i>Anser griseus</i>
Vieillot,
1818.</li>

<li><b>Cereopsis</b> is feminine so the specific epithet is <i>
grisea</i>.</li>

<li>The Nomenclator Animalium (Schulze <i>et al.</i> Bd.3 Lief.11 p.1421)
confirms this and adds that Lesson uses 'Guaruba' again on p.654.</li>

<li>Waterhouse lists only 'Guaruba' (1889: 88), which is not
commented on by Richmond in his corrections.</li>

<li>Sherborn (Index Animalium p.2850) lists the name as <b>Guarouba</b> from
p.210, and <b>Guaruba</b> from p.211</li>

<!-- <li>Thus, "Guaruba" <b>could</b> be construed as a 'Justified
Emendation' by Article <a
href="./iczn/ICZN4.html#Article33" target="ref_fr">33.2.1.</a>. -->

<li>Wolter's uses (1975:57) "Guaruba Less., 1831[sic] <i>Guaruba
guarouba</i> (Gmel., 1788)."</li>

<li>Sick, Birds in Brazil (1993: 267) also uses "<i>Guaruba
guarouba</i>" and notes that 'much biological data... support
omission of <i>G. guarouba</i> from Aratinga'.</li>

<li>Current useage would seem to favour <b>Guaruba</b>.</li>

<li>The questions appear to be:<ol>
<li>Does Lesson's use of <b>Guarouba</b> and <b>Guaruba</b>
constitute " two or more names in the same work [...] treated in a
    similar way" as rule 33.2.1 states? In which case it
    would fall into the classification of a "demonstrably
    intentional" emendation.</li>
<li>Or, if the emendation is unjustified, is it the prevailing
useage, and is this unjustified emendation attributed to Lesson? The
attribution to Lesson is not in doubt, so the question then turns on
whether or not it is the prevailing usage.</ol>

</ul>
<li>Alternatively, Normand David raises a different, and compelling
approach: (2002.01.31)<pre>
"Guarouba Lesson Trait&eacute; p. 210  /  Guaruba Lesson Trait&eacute; p. 211,
654

Here we have a case of two different spellings of a name in a work.
In my understanding, it is covered by 24.2.3 (First Reviser) and/or
24.2.4 (author as First Reviser). This is repeated in Art. 32.2.1,
but with a minor exception: "except as provided otherwise in this
Article" [= 32]. Here is my understanding of the "exception": for
example, a First Reviser selects "<i>terrae novae</i>" and rejects
"<i>terraenovae</i>; then, Art. 32, and specifically Art. 32.5.2.2
is used for changing "<i>terrae novae</i>" to "<i>terraenovae</i>".

Coming back to Guarouba/Guaruba:

1) Did a First Reviser (24.2.3) act on the case?. If so, the
matter is settled. But...

2) Did Lesson, IN A SUBSEQUENT WORK. use one of the two spellings
(24.2.4). If so, the matter is settled. I feel he did not. A
reliable list of synonyms should be checked for a start (caution:
the CBBM is not reliable for exact spelling transcriptions).

Emendations by authors of names in the work itself (33.2.1) are
extremely rare. They have to be "demonstrably intentional". The
clause "or when two or more names in the same work are treated in a
similar way" is rather restrictive. 
The French text of the Code gives a clue:
"<i>ou si le m&ecirc;me travail contient d'autres noms modifi&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on
similaire</i>".
Here is my literal translation into English: "or when the work contains other names that were
modified in a similar fashion".
For Lessons's <i>Guarouba/Guaruba</i>, I would accept a
"demonstrably intentional change" <b>if</b> he had modified other
generic names in a similar way, for example (hypothetical):
Matouga/Matuga, Edwourda/Edwurda. That is: changing "ou" to "u" from
genus headings to species headings ("in a similar way").

Obviously, this is not the case. Therefore, "Guaruba" is not
"demonstrably intentional" and it is not an emendation (33.2).

If I were to act as First Reviser, I would select GUAROUBA: It is
the sole unambiguous genus heading. A First Reviser is not bound by
"prevailing usage" and I feel that del Hoyo's HBW use of GUAROUBA
carries weight."
</pre>
<li>Normand's work on this issue continued, and he subsequently reflected on the
problem implied by determining whether this matter was dealt with in a single
work, or whether the presence of component "parts" implied "multiple works".
Part of his consideration (2005.01.30) is as follows.<pre>
When dealing with multi-part works, for name dating purposes (= priority), Art. 21.5 prescribes: 
"If parts of a work were published on different days, the date of publication of each part is to be 
separately determined."

What happens then when two or more different spellings of the same name occur in a multi-part work?
Please read carefully:
24.2.3: "...spelled in more than one way in the <b>original work</b>, ...";
24.2.4: "...<b>subsequently</b> uses one of them as valid <b>in a work</b>...";

Two interpretations may be offered, as delineated below. 
Please bear in mind that any decision (1 or 2) has enormous consequences for many other multi-part works, 
as well as for the status of contained spellings. <ol>

<li> Lesson's Trait&eacute; is one work, usually found in two separate bounded
volumes (I, text; II, plates; each with different title pages), which however
was issued in eight successive parts (livraisons), each with text and plates. [I
assume that binding instructions were given to buyers]. We have Guarouba on p.
210, and Guaruba on pp. 211 and 654. We have a name "spelled in more than one
way in the <b>original work</b>". A First Reviser is thus needed, in a
subsequent work; none found yet.</li>

<li>Each part (livraison) of Lesson's Trait&eacute; is a work; in one part, we
have Guarouba on p. 210, and Guaruba on p. 211. A First Reviser is thus needed,
in a subsequent work. In the part that contains the Index, Lesson subsequently
used Guaruba on p. 654 -a First Reviser act by the author himself.
Under that interpretation, please consider this: if Guarouba was found on pp. 210 and 211, 
and Guaruba on p. 654, then the latter would be an incorrect subsequent
spelling -subject to prevailing usage assessment under the 1999 Code.</li></ol>

Initially, I favoured interpretation 1) for works such as Lesson's
Trait&eacute;. Later, through exchanges with Edward and other taxonomists with
deep knowledge with the Code, I came to feel that interpretation 2) is the
correct one. Among other reasons: a part of a multi-part work meets the
definition of published work (arts. 8 and 9); first reviser actions refer only
to simultaneously published names, acts and spellings, meaning the first reviser
selection cannot deal with Guarouba p. 210, Guaruba p. 211, AND Guaruba p. 654;
it can only deal with the simultaneously published Guarouba p. 210, AND Guaruba
p. 211.

I know that I have written in previous e-mails that I favoured Guarouba, ...
but it is impossible to find in the present Code clear and unambiguous support
for interpretation 1). There are several other similar cases and consistency is
the most important resolution path.

Perhaps Lesson intended Guarouba, and was twarted by poor proof-reading and/or
printer's errors, but the arbitrary rules of the Code now yield the spelling
Guaruba. And the use of the spelling Guarouba (HBW, etc.) does not change
anything: it is an incorrect original, not an incorrect subsequent spelling, and
thus not concerned by "prevailing usage".</pre> </li>

Uraeginthus granatinus <strong>Spelling</strong>
<ul>

<li>Often spelt <i>granatin<b>a</b></i>. (e.g. Sibley &amp; Monroe, and
Peters)</li>
<li><cite>David N &amp; Gosselin M. 2002. "Gender agreement of avian
species names." BBOC. <b>122</b>(1):17</cite> discuss this. They
indicate that: "The adjective <i>granatina</i> is derived from the Latin
noun <i>granatum</i>, <i>-i</i> [garnet, pomegranate] to which the
adjectival suffix <i>-inus</i>, (<i>a, -um</i>) was added, in reference
to the red colour of the bird."</li>
<li>Cabanis lists the form "U. granatinus<i> <b>Nob. -</b></i>" in
Mus.Hein. 1(1850) p.171, the page where he erects the genus
<b>Uraeginthus</b>.</li>
<li>During the period of 1978-1992 only the combination <i>Uraeginthus
granatin<b>a</b></i> occurs in the <b>Zoo. Rec.</b>; it occurs 5 times
between
1981 and 1986.</li>
