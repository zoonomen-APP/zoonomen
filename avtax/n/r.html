<A name="M.l.ruthaCite"></a>
Myadestes lanaiensis rutha <strong>Citation</strong>

<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>X</b>:163 (1964) is confused and confusing
		in this area, and has a citation for this taxon that
		does not seem to match the publication of the name.</li>
	<li>The top of page heading changes from "Family MUSCICAPIDAE"
		to "Subfamily TURDINAE" in the middle of the genus <b>Cercomela</b>.</li>
	<li>The citation for <i>Phaeornis rutha</i> is given as "Occ. Papers Bishop Mus. 
		[Honolulu], <b>4</b>, pp. 43; 81"
	<li> This serial has peculiar pagination, with through pagination for the volume and
		individual pagination for the component numbers.</li>
	<li>The description for this bird is on p.171 of the volume, and p.81 of part 2.</li>

<A name="P.p.rossikowiAuthor" id="P.p.rossikowiAuthor"></a>
Pyrrhula pyrrhula rossikowi <strong>Author</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Conventionally cited to Derjugin &amp; Bianchi (e.g. Peters CL <b>XIV</b>:298, Howard &amp; Moore 3<sup>rd</sup>:757, HBW.)</li>
	<li>My review of the original article indicates that Bianchi suggested a provisional name (<i>Pyrrhula pyrrhula rossikowi</i>), if the form 
	in question proved to be adequately distinct.</li>
	<li>My interpretation is that Derjugin alone is thus the author of the name.</li>

<A name="I.rufescensCite" id="I.rufescensCite">
	Illadopsis rufescens <strong>Citation</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The citation as given conventionally and as give here to J.Orn. 26 p.209 is almost
		certainly the incorrect citation.</li>
		<li>The evidence is overwhelming, but not absolute, that the correct citation is more likely
		to be:<ul> 
		<li>Illadopsis rufescens (<a href="../bio/bior.html#Reichenow"
		target="ref_fr">Reichenow</a>) 1878 <i><a
		href="../cit/jouro.html#Orn.Centralbl."
		target="ref_fr">Orn.Centralbl.</a></i> 3 no.9 p.71</li>
		</ul>
		<li>During this period, the J.Orn. seems to have been consistently late in publication,
		usually about 5 to 7 months after the nominal date. The no. that follows that containing
		<i>Turdoides rufescens</i> (no.143), which is nominally the "Juli" number, includes an
		article by Nehrkorn that is noted "Riddagshausen im Nov. 78." at the end, making "Juli"
		clearly incorrect. I do not find specific evidence of delay for no.142 (the "April" number), 
		but given the fact that the surrounding numbers were late, it is unlikely that no.142 was published on time.
		This taxon was also described in the May number (no.9) of the Orn.Centralblatt for 1878. To date I know of 
		no evidence for delay of publication in Orn.Centralblatt so it is extremely likely that the "May" number
		for that serial was published well before the "April" number of J.Orn.</li>

Rhodophoneus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Conventionally cited to 1871.</li>
	<li>Zimmer 1926 p.301 lists his best determination of the
	dating of the parts of this publication. He lists<pre> 
		pp. ? - 656 pll. VII and XXVb, before Oct. 3, 1870</pre></li>
	<li>Schultze <i>et al.</i> p.3034 give the date for this as "VII 1871"

<hr>
<A name="T.rufopalliatusNomen" id="T.rufopalliatusNomen"></a>
Turdus rufopalliatus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Usually listed as "rufopalliatus" (<i>e.g.</i> by CBBM, Peters CL, AOU CL, H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:672.) however the original orthography is clearly 
	"r<b><big>o</big></b>fopalliatus". (and as shown by Sherborn's Index Animalium p.5538).
       The original can be seen here:	
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/n/image/revuezoologiquep03soci_0271.jpg"
		target="new">Rev.Zool. 3 p.259</a>
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/n/image/revuezoologiquep03soci_0272.jpg"
		target="new">Rev.Zool. 3 p.260</a></li>
	<li>The name, however, (as helpfully pointed out by Normand David) 
	is listed as "r<b><big>u</big></b>fopalliatus" in the index, which can be seen here:	
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/n/image/revuezoologiquep03soci_0391.jpg"
		target="new">Rev.Zool. 3 p.377</a></li>
	<li>Bangs and Penard, in 1919 (Bull.Mus.Comp.Zool. <b>63</b>:31) include both
	spellings, and implicitly have chosen <i>rufopalliatus</i>. This can be seen here:
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/n/image/bulletinofmuseum63harv_0039.jpg"
		target="new">Bull.Mus.Comp.Zool. 63 p.31</a></li>
	<li>I initially interpreted Bangs and Penard as having functioned as first revisers 
	in this matter, and use the name as <i>rufopalliatus</i>. However, Norman David 
	again helpfully points out, that in the example of a Journal (such as Rev.Zool.)
	the Index presumably is not made up by the author(s) of the articles that compose
	the volume. This would suggest that a first reviser action may not be possible 
	in this case.</li>
	<li>Additionally, I note that the Rev.Zool. Index is included with the December number, while
	the name <i>rofopalliatus</i> is to be found in the September number, and these separately 
	issued numbers are viewed as separate works by the Code. Thus a
	"clear indication" of error, or <i>lapsus</i>, can be sought only in the
	September number. In the description, the word <i><big>rouss&acirc;tre</big></i> is used
	twice, and the phrase <i><big>broun roux assez vif</big></i> occurs once. These words
	(and the appearance of the bird) are strong indications that the "reddish" or 
	<i>rufo-</i> "idea" is appropriate. An incorrect
	latinization on Lafresnaye's part is unlikely (though one has to rely on external
	evidence for this fact) so a <i>lapsus calami</i> is an acceptable interpretation, and
	correction to <i>rufopalliatus</i> can be employed.</li>	
	<li>Thanks to Colin Jones for bringing this to my attention.</li>

<A name="E.rueppeliiNomenclature" id="E.rueppeliiNomenclature"></a>
Eupodotis rueppelii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Most often spelled with a double -ll (<i>rueppellii</i>).</li>
	<li>Colin Jones points out that the original is spelled with one -l
	(<i>R&uuml;ppelii</i>) and I note that no mention of R&uuml;ppell is
	made in the article. So I employ the spelling as originally published.</li>
	<li>I suppose this lack of specific reference raises a question as to whether 
	the epithet should be spelled
		<i>ruppelii</i> rather than <i>rueppelii</i>.</li>
	<li>The original description can be seen here:

	<li>1884, may be correct, but as the foot of the title page says

Zoothera piagiae ruwenzorii <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:661 gives the date for this taxon as 1985,
	(through Corrigenda 8) but gives the date as 1984 (!!) in the list of taxa published

Onychognathus morio rueppellii <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>I initially gave the citation here as given in Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:89 
	[= Amadon 1962].  I am suspicious about the date ("1865"), though it may be correct.</li>
	<li>This work is, so far, a bit of a mystery, and appears to have been 
	frequently re-issued with title pages bearing different dates. I suspect
	that the publishing history is complex, and may be largely unknown.</li>
	<li>I wonder what basis Amadon had for the date of 1865 for this name.</li>
	<li>Colin Jones points out (2009.06.22) that I had overlooked the Corrigenda
	note indicating that apparently data have been found indicating that the correct
	date is "1856" based on information in the Biblio. de la France. It will be interesting
	to see what is brought forth on this.</li>

	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:115 (= Amadon 1962) cites this
	to Ann.Mus.Civ.Genova <b>10</b>:12, and spells the name
	with a single -i ending.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index indicates the Ann.Mus.Civ.Genova issue
	was published May 3, 1877, but this included the manuscript of
	an article in the Sydney Mail, published on Saturday Feb. 24, 1877.</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index indicates that the name in the Sydney Mail, and 
	the Ann.Mus.Civ.Genova was spelled with a double -ii ending.</li>
	<li>The CBBM <b>13</b>:115 entry lists this name with the double -ii ending,
	but also says the name was published in Ibis in 1877. That article also notes
	that it was reprinted from the Sydney Mail Feb. 24, 1877 (see footnote on p.363).
	Of interest in this printing, the name is spelled with a single -i ending.</li>
	<li>I believe the Sydney Mail publication clearly has priority (<i>contra</i> Peters),
	and employs the double -ii ending. (<i>contra</i> Peters, and H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:653).</li>

Campylorhynchus rufinucha rufus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This taxon is not listed in Peters Checklist <b>9</b>, but is included in 
	H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:634. It is accompanied only with a note in 
	Corrigendum 6 indicating the subspecific epithet should be held as "<i>rufus</i>, 
	not <i>rufum</i> because of "gender concordance".</li>
	<li>It does not appear to me to have been carefully considered, or well worked out.<ol>
		<li>The name is listed as <pre> <i>C.r.rufum</i> Nelson 1897</pre></li>
		<li>As near as I can find, Nelson never described a "<i>rufum/rufus</i>" taxon
		in <b>Campylorhynchus</b>, but did describe <i>Heleodytes humilis rufus</i>
		in 1897 (Auk <b>14</b>:69), and I presume this is the taxon in 
		consideration here.</i></li>
		<li>A.R. Phillips "The Known Birds of North and Middle America Part I" (1986) 
		is not directly referenced by the authors of H&amp;M 
		3<sup><small>rd</small></sup> in relation to this taxon, 
		but they may have consulted. Phillips (p.122) who cites:<pre>
	(?)<i>C. r. rufum</i> (Nelson) 1897, Auk 14:69</pre> and notes "A poorly marked

<li>The 5<sup>th</sup> AOU CL dates this to March 14, 1871, and this is the date given by the 1913

of March 14, 1871 there was discussion of the fact that the Sept.-Dec. number had been published.
Thus it is likely the actual date of publication preceeds March 14, 1871, but it seems reasonable to

<li>It appears to me that the overwhelming likelihood is that Sherborn and Richmond are correct,
Peters is partly correct, and Sharpe and HBW are wrong with regards the initial spelling.</li>
<li>Normand David addresses the matter of this name (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.07.28) thus:<pre>
<i>rufuscens</i>, Swainson, 1837, Birds W. Afr <b>1</b>:109 
Peters <b>I</b>:407 cites "<i>rufuscens</i> [sic]" and uses <i>rufescens</i>

with at least 34 other similar cases.  They are "defective" or misspelled Latin words. Now art.
32.5.1 says "Incorrect transliteration or latinization, or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel,
are not to be considered inadvertent errors";  but since only foreign (non-Latin) words can be
transliterated or latinized (see definitions in the Glossary), it follows that "defective" Latin
words can be viewed as inadvertent errors.

As far as I can see, this is why "<i>rufuscens</i>" was corrected to <i>rufescens</i> (the
correction is good Latin). Here I advocate the use of correction (see the title of 32.5: Spellings
that must be corrected...);  and the Code creates confusion by using "justified emendation" (33.2.2)
-it should be mandatory correction, and the concept of (unjustified) emendation should be applied
only to deliberate changes (33.2.1).

Good news: the correction to rufescens does not fall prey to PU: PU preys upon subsequent spellings
not original spellings.</pre>

<li>The <i>-ornis</i> ending is, in itself, variable (masculine or feminine), so I
turned to evaluating the gender of the specific epithet with which it was originally
combined. Kaup combined it with <i>magnirostris</i> and <i>-rostris</i> is a Latin
adjectival form that is also of common, or variable gender. In such instances, when
an adjective is not indicative ofa particular gender it is held to be masculine

Apteryx rowi <strong>Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recently described as a separate species. An abstract of the publication
indicates<pre>
The new species differs only slightly from the other brown kiwis. Differences
can be found in plumage colour and colouration of bare parts, which are all
paler than in other brown kiwis with the head, neck and belly feathers
noticeably grey (often with some white on the head), the softness of the
feathers (softer when stroked backwards than in Tokoeka), the shorter bill and
the barred outer wing feathers (not present in the other brown kiwis). Apart
from the holotype, only six specimens (paratypes) of the new species are known. 
</pre></li>
<li>Additionally there are comments on the name<pre>
The existence of more than one species of brown kiwi had already been deduced
from molecular studies in 2001 and was published two years later (Burbidge, M L,
Colbourne, R M, Robertson, H A & Baker, A J 2003. Molecular and other biological
evidence supports the recognition of at least three species of brown kiwi.
Conserv.Genet. <b>4</b>: 167-177). However, the name '<i>Apteryx rowii</i>' used
in this publication does not comply in every aspect with the rules set by the
International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and the same applies to
earlier descriptions of this taxon, all leading to invalid scientific names
(<i>nomina nuda</i>). A <i>nomen nudum</i> ('naked name') implies that the given
name has no official status (is invalid) and should not be used to refer to the
taxon involved. Considering the urgent need for a properly established
scientific name for the new species, Tennyson et al (2003) decided that it was
best to quickly name and describe the new species in a separate publication.
Tokoeka is a polytypic species with at least three different 'lineages', now
grouped into two subspecies. Further studies may reveal that more subspecies
should be recognized or that subspecies should also be awarded species status.
More information on the status, population and distribution of all five kiwi
species, including colour photographs of each species, can be found at the kiwi
recovery website (www.kiwirecovery.org.nz/Kiwi/Home/).</pre>

Peters "(after may 1849)".</li> 
<li>The date of <b>Dendropicus</b> is more of a problem. It was published in

<i>Dendropicos hartlaubii</i>.  Thus it is not clear whether <b>Dendorpicus</b>
is a <i>lapsus</i>, an emendation or a new genus description, though the latter
seems unlikely.</li> 
<li>Sherborn has these entries <pre> 
<b>Dendropicos</b> A.  Malherbe, M&eacute;m. Ac. Metz., XXX (<i>post</i> May) 1849, 338. -A.
<b>Dendropicus</b>  Malh. 1849; <i>teste</i> Waterhouse, Dendropicos <i>est. q.v.</i></pre>
("q.v." = <i>quod vide</i> = for which see).<br>

I interpret Sherborn to interpret <b>Dendropicus</b> to be an emendation
of <b>Dendropicos</b>, or possibly <i>vice versa</i> if the Rev.Mag.Zool.
publication antedates the Mem.Acad.R.Metz.</li> <li>The issue of dates of the

unpublished notes on Dates of Publication. Perhaps most salient is his note
saying:<pre> <u>Revue Zoologique.</u> <big>Important!</big> The nos. of the
Rev.Zool. <u>prob. never came</u> out <u>during</u> the <u>month</u> mentioned

<li>To date, I am unable to find any indication that <b>Megal&aelig;ma</b> was
proposed as a distinct generic entity. Thus I interpret it to be an emendation
and do not use parentheses around the author's name. Sherborn lists
<b>Megalaema</b> (without ligature) as an Agassiz "<i>emend. pro</i> Megalaima,
Gray.", and Schulze "Nomen. animalium gen. et subgen." p.1995 also has this
interpretation.</li>
<li>If <b>Megal&aelig;ma</b> was proposed distinctly as a genus, and is not a
misspelling or emendation I would be very eager to know of the facts supporting
that case as it appears to be unknown to Sherborn, Richmond, or Schulze,
et al.</li>

<li>Riesing et al. treat the phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships in

Cyornis ruckii <strong>Spelling </strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>11</b>:361 uses the spelling <b>ruecki</b> noting that this
was an emendation made by Sharpe in his Hand-list of Birds, 1901 <b>3</b>:214.</li>
<li>Sibley &amp; Monroe hold this to be an unjustified emendation.</li>
<li>The taxon is named after M. R&uuml;ck. R&uuml;ck collected the specimen in Malacca (type -- 2
specimens -- in the Paris Museum). However the Richmond Index indicates that Oustalet's spelling
of the species epithet is <b><i>Ruckii</i></b>.</li>
<li>Sharpe's spelling in his Hand-List is, in fact, <b><i>ruecki</i></b> as Peters indicates.
<li>During the period of 1978-1992 the species epithet <i>ru[e]cki[i]</i> does not occur in the
<b>Zoo. Rec.</b>.</li> 
<li>[2009.09.14] The question, of course, is: was M. R&uuml;ck German, or (more probably) Dutch?
If he was Dutch, the spelling <i>ruckii</i> would be appropriate if German or if it is uncertain, 
then the umlaut may be appropriate.</li>
<li>In Corrigenda 8 Dickinson <i>et al.</i> may have the correct decision, but their facts
appear to be simply wrong. They write:<pre>
Cyornis ruecki [M. LeCroy 2008, Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist 313 p. 94 found the original spelling 
to be r&uuml;ckii and lacking evidence for whether the name was based upon a German word 
retained the spelling ruecki; she appears to have not retained -ii due to prevaiing usage. 
We may use rueckii in next Edition.]</pre>
My reading of Mary LeCroy's finding is different, she says (p.94):<pre>
Originally, the current name of this form was spelled <i>Siphia ruckii</i>, without an umlaut
(Oustalet, 1881: 78),...</pre> The phrase "without an umlaut" indicates to me that she did <b>not</b>
"f[ind' the original spelling to be r&uuml;ckii" so if the umlaut is "retained" it is 
retained from the emendation and certainly not from the original description.</li>
<li>Dickinson <i>et al.</i> appear to be proceeding on the basis of incorrect 
facts (Mary's finding). Ideally we would determine the nationality of M. R&uuml;ck; like Mary, 
I have so far not been able to do this.</li>
<li>Given the confusion (and error) here I retain the <b>original</b> spelling 
"<i>ruckii</i>" for the present.</li>
<li>[2009.09.15] One factor that may add to the confusion here is that the diagnosis was 
"reproduced" by Reichenow and Schalow in J.Orn. <b>32</b>:398 (1884); 
in that location the binomen is rendered <pre>301. <i>Siphia R&uuml;ckii.</i></pre></li>

for this citation.</li>  
<li>Both Sherborn 1902 and {Richmond, et al. 1992} note "Ex Licht.".</li>
<li>I am uncertain what standing Gray has in this matter, though G.R.
Gray used the name <i>Balearica regulorum</i> in 1844 in his
List of Birds of the British Museum, where again it is "Ex. Licht.".</li>
<li>The article in the PZS (a segment called "On several animals recently added
to the Society's Menagerie." is attributed in the table of contents (p.[iii]) to
E.T. Bennett, Esq. However, the text of the material makes note of points
made by "Mr. Gray" regarding the morphology of the birds and those implications,
thus suggesting that it may be Gray who is establishing the material.</li>
<li>The text of the matter reads:<pre>
 The two species may thus be distinguished:

		Genus <big>A</big>NTHROPO&Iuml;DES, Vieill.

 *<i>Occipite cristato, crist&acirc; erect&acirc;, effus&acirc; e plumis setaceis constante.</i>

<big>A</big>NTHROPO&Iuml;DES PAVONINUS, Viell. <i>Anth. genis nudis, supern&egrave;
  albis infern&egrave; lat&egrave; roseis; paleari minimo; gutturis plumis elon-
  gatis nigriescentibus.</i>
Ardea pavonina, <i>Linn. et Auct.</i>
<i>Hab.</i> in Afric&acirc; Septontrionali et Occidentali.

<big>A</big>NTHROPO&Iuml;DES <big>R</big>EGULORUM. <i>Anth. genis nudis, albis supern&egrave;
  roseis; paleari magno; gutturis plumis elongatis pendulinis c&aelig;ru-
  lescenti-cinereis.</i>

  Grus Regulorums, <i>Licht.</i>
  <i>Hab.</i> in Afric&acirc; Meridionali.
  It is probable that this latter species has been figured by Petiver
and by Kolbe; but their representations are by no means sufficiently
defined to authorize a postivie reference to them.
  Mr. Gray took occasion to remark that the oval form of the
nostrils in the <i>crowned Cranes</i>, added to other distinguishing cha-
racters which have frequently been pointed out, might be regarded
as indicating a generic difference between them and the <i>Demoiselle</i>
and <i>Stanley Cranes</i>, in which the nostrils have the lengthened form
usual in the genus <i>Grus</i>, a genus from which they scarcely differ
except in the comparative shortness of their bill.  For the group
including the <i>crowned Cranes</i> the name of <i>Balearica</i> might, he 
thought, be retained; and that of <i>Anthropo&iuml;des</i> be appropriated to
the one comprehending <i>Anth. Virgo,</i> Vieill. and <i>Anth. paradis&aelig;us</i>,
Bechst.</li></pre>

<li>Thus, while it appears there are clearly indications of Gray's involvement, the
full extent is not (to me) evident, and I continue to treat Bennett as the author.</li>

<li>HBW <b>4</b>:146 spells it reinwart<b>i</b>i, with the note that
Temminck "himself" emended the name. I presume that this refers to
his emendation in Pl.Col. livr.101-2 (probably 1839) p.81 (though I am
made somehwhat uneasy by the fact that the authors of the article do not
include a specific reference to the emandation article). Whether that
emendation satisfies the ICZN requirements is not known to me.</li>
<li>With some unease, I follow the spelling favored by the authors of the
HBW article.</li>

Histurgops ruficaudata <strong>spelling  </strong>
<ul>
<li>Usually spelt <i>Histurgops ruifcauda</i>.</li>
<li>I initially interpreted ICZN 1999 30.1.4.3 to state that the
genus-group name is masculine. If so, I believed the species-group
name should be <i>ruficaudat<b>us</b></i>.</li>
<li>Normand David corrected me in this (2002.05.29); he writes:<p>
"The original spelling <i>Histurgops ruficauda</i> Reichenow, 1887
is used correctly by Peters (<b>XV</b>:6) and S &amp; M 1990. Although
<b>Histurgops</b> is masculine, the species-group name <i>ruficauda</i>
is an invariable noun phrase (and needs no change)."</li>
