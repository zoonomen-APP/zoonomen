Orthotomus atrogularis major <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Watson, in Peters Checklist <b>11</b>:180 (1986) proposed a replacement name <i>anambensis</i> due to the 1899
		name "<i>Orthotomus major</i>" that Blundell &amp; Lovatt gave to an Abyssinian bird. This bird was subsequently
		placed in <b>Prinia</b>.<br>  
		In contrast to the interpretaion of Watson, under Mayr's guidance, this subsequent 
		generic reassignment, according to the mode of interpretation currently holding sway, obviates the 
		need for a replacement name.</li>

Leuconotopicus villosus monticola <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>See previous (incorrect) logic and discussion below.</li>
	<li>Anthony's "correction" from <i>montanus</i> to <i>monticola</i> (a correction that would not be required or
		valid under the current Code) must stand, as it was done before 1961, and is currently in use. (ref. Code Article 59.3).</li>
	<li>Thanks to Dick Schodde and David Donsker for this understanding.</li>

	<h3>Previously (2017.09.25)</h3>
	<li>Often used as "<i>monticola</i>" following Anthony's 1898 note
		indicating that "the name <i>monatanus</i> seems to be 
		preoccupied in this genus." (Auk <b>15</b>:54 1898).</li>
	<li>However, I find no evidence that the name <i>montanus</i> <strong>is</strong>
		preoccupied in the genus. Finding no combination "<i>Dryobates ... montanus</i> in 
		the Richmond Index, The CBBM, or in Sherborn, I am not convinced that a replacement name was needed.</li>
	<li>Discussion of this matter by Oberholser and J.A.Allen can be found in the correspondence of the 1896 
		Auk <b>13</b>: 190-192. Allen held that no replacement name was needed, while Oberholser raised the 
		consideration that a Brehm <i>Picus montanus</i> name might, by being relegated to the synonomy of 
		another genus (<b>Dendrocopos</b> (= <b>Dryobates</b>)) represent a conflict, thus implying (it seems)
		a distinction between a "zoological genus" and "nomencltural genus" (his terms). Allen felt that it was
		establishd that the name <i>montanus</i> had <b>never</b> been linked with <b>Dryobates</b> and thus
		no replacement name was needed.</li>
	<li>Why Allen's position, which I think is in line with current nomenclatural rules, was not followed is not clear.</li>
	<li>I shudder when I think that those for whom familiarity trumps adherence to the code may argue for "prevailing usage"
		in an attempt to presereve <i>monticola</i>.</li>

Mathewsia genus group name <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li><b>Antigone</b> Reichenbach 1852 is recently proposed as a genus group name to deal with the paraphyly identified in <b>Grus</b>. (See Krajewski, <i>et al.</i>; Auk <b>127</b>:440-452 &amp; NACC 2016-C4)</li>
	<li>However <b>Antigone</b> was used by J.E. Gray (1847) in a list of molluscs. <a href="./image/PZS15_184.jpg" target=new><i>PZS <b>15</b>:184</i></a></li> <li>Iredale (1911) discussed the possible use of <b>Antigone</b>, and proposed <b>Mathewsia</b>
		with the type <i>Ardea rubicunda</i> Perry 1817.
	(Iredale's 1911 BBOC article can be seen here: 
		<a href="./image/BBOC27_47.jpg" target=new><i>BBOC <b>27</b>:47</i></a>)</li> 
	<li>However, in 1914 (Austral.Av.Rec. 2 no.5 p.81) Iredale noted that a Coleopteran genus "<b>Mathewsia</b>" had been erected in 1868, and he 
	proposed a replacement name <b>Mathewsena</b> with the same type.
	The 1914 Austral.Av.Rec. article can be seen here:
	<a href="./image/AAR1914_81.jpg" target=new><i>AAR1914_81</i></a> &amp; 
	<a href="./image/AAR1914_82.jpg" target=new><i>AAR1914_82</i></a></li> 
	<li>Wolters (1982) lists <b>Mathewsena</b> as a subgenus of <b>Grus</b>.</li>
	<li>I presume the gender here is feminine.</li>
	<li>In the NACC proposal to use <b>Antigone</b> I do not find any discussion of the molluscan use of the name, or of Iredale's proposed use of <b>Mathewsena</b></li>

Pagodroma nivea major <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Bonaparte first (1856) used "<i>major</i>" as one of two variants of <i>Pagodroma nivea</i>. In Consp.Gen.Av. <b>II</b>:192 <i>major</i> and
		<i>minor</i> are simply listed as "a." and "b." with no description.  In C.R. Acad.Sci. <b>42</b>:768 Bonaparte lists only
		<i>Pagodroma nivea</i> and does not include the "major" and "minor" forms.</li>
	<li>Schlegel (1863) in Mus.Hist.Pays-BasRev.Meth.Crit.Coll. livr.4 no.22 Procellariae p.15,16 listed components of <i>Procellaria nivea</i> including Bonaparte's <i>major</i>, and here includes measurements and specifying descriptive features.</li>
	<li>I interpret Schlegel as using this name as a subspecies within <i> Procellaria nivea</i>, and being the first to meet the
		requirements for a valid description. Therefore, I  list the
		authority in parentheses.</li>

	<li>My interpretation is that this satisfied the requirements of 
	ICZN 33.2.1.<pre> 
	"A change in the original spelling of a name is only to be interpreted as 
	"demonstrably intentional" when in the work itself, 
	or in an author's (or publisher's) corrigenda, there is an 
	explicit statement of intention, or when both the original 
	and the changed spelling are cited and the latter is adopted in 
	place of the former, or when two or more names

Kaupifalco monogrammicus merid <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Usually referred to as <i>Kaupifalco monogrammicus meridionalis</i></li> 
	<li>The original description can be seen here: 
	<a href="./image/lietuvostsrmoksl60liet_0159.jpg" target=new><i>Micronisus monogrammicus </i>var. <i>Merid.</i> Original Description</a></li>
	<li>As Hartlaub states that he thinks this is a "southern local race", it is understandable
		that the interpretation has been made  that "Merid." quite probably stands
		for "Meridionalis". Probable, but not certain.</li>
	<li>The ICZN has dealt with other names presented in an "abbreviated" form,
	for example <i>Psittacus haematod.</i> which is dealt with in Declaration 82 (1957 
	[not seen yet]. In that instance they establish "haematodus" as the specific epithet.</li>
	<li>This is particularly important as there are other names in apparently "abbreviated
	form" that are <b>not</b> explicitly dealt with by the ICZN. This suggests to me that
	unless names in abbreviated form are specifically and particularly dealt with by the 
	ICZN, then the abbreviated form must be used in the abscence of 
	action by the Commission.</li>
	<li>It is possible, I suppose, that Declaration 82 makes a broader statement regarding
	treatment of names in apparently abbreviated form, but since the "haematod." case was dealt
	with so specifically, I think this is unlikely.</li>
	<li>It is possible, that there could be a "first reviser" type situation for names in 
	abbreviated form.</li>
	<li>From Bob Dowsett I learned [2009.08.06] that both "merid" and "meridionalis" have 
	been used in the Afroavian literature.</li>
	<li>It would appear to me that the burden of proof lies on those who wish to use
		spelling other than that originally employed.</li>

<A name="D.melanozanthumNomen" id="D.melanozanthumNomen">
Dicaeum melanozanthum <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This name was originally written by Blyth as "P[achyglossa] melanozantha Hodgson"</li>
	<li>Finn Salomonsen writes (Peters CL <b>12</b>:179 f.n.1) <pre>
<small><sup>1</sup></small> The spelling <i>melanozantha</i> is unintentional, since everywhere else
in the paper Blyth uses the spelling <i>"-xantha"</i> where this vocable
enters a new species name (such as <i>Rhipidura hypoxantha</i>). Further-
more, Blyth subsequently used the spelling <i>Pachyglossa melanoxantha</i>,
e.g., in 1849, Cat. Birds Mus. Asiat. Soc., p. 339. &#8212; F. S.</pre></li>
	<li>I think Salomonsen would have been more correct if he had said that his <b>opinion</b>
	was that the spelling was unintentional.</li>
	<li>In my <b>opinion</b> the initial spelling "melanozantha" probably <b>was</b> 
	intentional, and represented the name as communicated to Blyth by Hodgson 
	(in a letter, in a manuscript, on a specimen label, or possibly on a drawing or painting). 
	In support of this possibility is the fact that Hodgson used a "z" rather than an "x" 
	in a similar naming situation (<i>Coccythraustus melanozanthos</i> Hodgson 1836, 
	now <i>Mycerobas melanozanthos</i>).</li>
	<li>Salomonsen cites Blyth's spelling of <i>Rhipidura hypoxantha</i> in support of his
	assertion that the spelling <i>melanozantha</i> was unintentional, and a casual superficial
	consideration of the matter would motivate one to agree. However the name <i>Rhipidura
		hypoxantha</i> apparently is a name <strong>due to Blyth and Blyth alone</strong> 
	(no attribution to Hodgson is given). Thus it seems to me that Blyth is consistent in 
	<b>his</b> habit of latinizing this vocable to "x" rather than "z". This instance
	does not support Salomosen's point which must address Blyth's treatment of a name
	proposed or used by Hodgson.  Rather, it seems to me that Blyth was 
	fastidious, careful, and intentional in his treatment of this vocable, 
	and there is every reason to presume that he was similarly careful in the 
	rendering "<i>melanozanthum</i> Hodgson".</li>
	<li>By this reasoning, I believe the spelling should be <i>melanozanthum</i>.</li>

	deviating from the usual practice of Ornithologists, we shall

	tion as usually accompanies the little quantity of useful Natural
	History which is generally given with each Species, is both 
	tedious and disgusting, and so unmeaning to the general
	Reader as to make Ornithology appear pedantic; whereas in
	our way of treating the subject, we flatter ourselves that the 
	Ornithologist will more easily identify the Species, the general
	Reader will peruse the Letterpress with pleasure, and this
	branch of the Sciences will obtain admirers and advocates.

Macgregoria <strong>Citation</strong>

	<li>The Genus and the species <i>pulchra</i> are often cited to Ibis(7) <b>III</b> no.10 1897 p.251 pl.VIII.</li>
	<li>The Ibis material was published in April of 1897, but this species was first described and the genus group name
	used in Jan. 1897 in a brief note in the BBOC, where it is indicated that DeVis was responsible for the name 
	and the description.</li>
	<li>The actual wording of the BBOC report is:<pre>
	Mr. Sclater exhibited a specimen of a new Paradise-bird sent to be figured in 'The Ibis' 
	by Mr. De Vis and proposed to be named <i>Macgregoria pulchra</i>. It had large eye-wattles 
	like <i>Paradigalla carunculata</i>, but quite different in shape, and the front was not naked, 
	but covered with erect bristles. This species had been discovered by Sir William Macgregor 
	on Mount Scratchley during his recent expedition across British New Guinea at an 
	altitude of from 10,000 to 12,000 feet.</pre></li>
	<li>The grammar here is short of ideal, but I think it is reasonable to interpret the first
	sentence as: "Mr. Sclater exhibited a specimen of a new Paradise-bird sent to be figured in 'The Ibis' 
	by Mr. De Vis and proposed [by him] to be named <i>Macgregoria pulchra</i>.

		<li>Evidently Vieillot's spelling was held to be unsatisfactory by the moderns. Who held that
		the incorrect subsequent spelling "melanorhamphos" should be conserved allegedly on the basis of
		"prevailing usage", though no data whatsoever appears to have been presented in support the assertion
		that the "melanorhamphos" spelling did, in fact, meet the definitional requirements of "prevailing usage".
		(ref. ICZN Article 3630.</li>
		<li>The Abstract of the Article reads as follows:
		<pre>
	The purpose of this application, under Articles 81.1, 81.2.3.2, 23.9.3 and
	33.3.1 of the Code is to (1) conserve the family name CORCORACIDAE Mathews, 1927
	for the Australian bird family known as mudnesters; and (2) conserve melanorhamphos
	Vieillot, 1817 as the correct spelling of the valid name for the type species of the
	type genus of CORCORACIDAE. At family or subfamily rank, CORCORACIDAE has been in
	prevailing use for the mudnesters for over 50 years. Reversal of precedence for the
	competing name STRUTHIDEIDAE Mathews, 1924 under Article 81.2.3.2 of the Code
	will maintain stability in nomenclature. The species-group name melanorhamphos, an
	incorrect subsequent spelling of Coracia melanoramphos Vieillot, 1817, has also been
	in prevailing use for the type species of the type genus of CORCORACIDAE for over 50
	years. Deeming melanorhamphos as the correct original spelling under Article 81.1
	and in accordance with Article 33.3.1 will also maintain stability in nomenclature.

<li>Jackson described this bird in <b>Campophaga</b> and that spelling is held by

authority should not be in parentheses.</li>
<li><pre><b>51.3.1.</b> Parentheses are not used when the species-group name was

<li>The Richmond Index shows that Finsch used the name in 1870 in Trans.Zool.Soc.London

<ul>
<li>Most workers attribute this name to Lawrence (<i>e.g.</i> Sclater CBBM
<b>15</b>:131; Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:44; Deignan USNM Bull. 221:239;
H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:424 ; HBW <b>8</b>:432 and this
interpretation is understandable when it is based on either a casual and
partial review of the original description, or more commonly when the
attribution simply results from uncritically reproducing the work of
others (as I did until looking into this matter in more detail).</li>
<li>The name is usually listed as a "Baird MS" name except in the case of
the Richmond Index where the name is 
listed as <pre>Baird in G. N. Lawrence</pre> so the question arises: what
are the facts of the matter?</li>
<li>First, Lawrence's note at the end of the article (p.482) must be heeded, 
it reads:
<pre>  <i>Note.</i>&#8212; I recently found in certain families of birds in the
collection of the Smith. Institution, several new species, and 
among others some with MS. names given by Prof. Baird,
which I have adopted; these are the five last described in the
above paper. Prof. Baird kindly furnished me with his notes,
made a few years since when he received the birds, with his
permission to use them and to make such alterations as I
might deem necessary; <b>his notes are indicated by quotation 
marks</b>.</pre> (emphasis supplied).</li>

The description that preceeds this is:<pre>
	<big><b>19. Dendrornis mentalis</b>, Baird, MS.</big>
	
  <b>"</b>This species has a very close resemblance to <i>D. eburneirostris</i>
in the reddish brown wings, tail and rump, the cential brownish
yellow shaft streaks of the feathers of back and belly becoming
shorter and more oval on the upper part of head and neck, and
still wider on the breast; the feet, however, are larger, and the
tarsus shorter, so that the former exceed the latter, while in _
<i>eburnirostris</i> the tarsus is longer than or at least nearly equal to
the middle toe and claw; the shade of reddish brown on wings and 
tail is lighter, the shafts of tail-feathers are light yellowish rufous,
instead of very dark reddish brown; the chin and upper part of
the throat in <i>eburneirostris</i> are uniform clear buff yellow, in the
new species these parts are lighter in color, and the feathers are 
margined with brown, as are those a on the lower part of the
throat; the yellowish of the shaft streaks in the head and back is
much paler; bill pale horn color, clouded; iris red; legs dark
brown.

  <b>"</b>Length 9.25; wing 4.34; tail 3.90; bill above 1.70, from nostril
1.28, gape 1.67; tarsus .88; middle toe and claw 1.00, middle toe
alone .70.

  <b>"</b><i>Habitat.</i>&#8212; Mexico, Mazatlan Collected by J Xantus. No. 
of type, 23,859.

  <b>"</b>Four specimens compared with a like numbem of <i>eburneirostris</i>, show
the peculvinties above referred to, in the pale colors, large feet and dusky margins
to the feathers of the chin.
  <b>"</b>I find no mention of any <i>Dendrornis</i> in Eastern Mexico, north of Cordova
or Xalapa, and of none in Western Mexico at all. The present species exhibits a range
considerably further to the north than any other of the genus.<b>"</b></pre>

<li>Article 50.1.1 of the Code (1999) reads:<pre>

work itself, then the author is deemed to be the person who publishes the work.</pre>
I hold that given the details of this matter and given Art. 50.1.1 that Baird is the

	<li>Ammodramus xanthornus <a href="../../bio/biog.html#Gould" target="ref_fr">Gould</a> 1839
	<i><a
	href="../../cit/jourz.html#Zool.Voy.Beagle[Darwin]" target="ref_fr">Zool.Voy.Beagle[Darwin]</a></i>

	target="ref_fr">Zool.Voy.Beagle[Darwin]</a></i> pt11 p.90 pl.30</li>
	</ol>
	and of these, the Gould citation appears to be correct, as the publication of Gould's plate
	evidently preceeded the publication of the text by four months. (ref. Steinheimer, Dickinson,
	&amp; Walters. 2006. "<i>The zoology of the voyage of the HMS Beagle. Part III. Birds:</i> new
	avian names, their authorship and their dates" BBOC <b>126</b>(3):171-193.).</li>

	<li>However, I am not convinced, as Steinheimer <i>et al.</i> appear to be, that the correct
	name for this subspecies is <i>Myospiza humeralis xanthornus</i> (Gould). Rather, it appears
	to me that <i>Myospiza humeralis manimbe</i> (Lichtenstein, 1823) may be correct. Steinheimer
	<i>et al.</i> state that the "substitute name <i>Ammodramus manimbe</i> (Gray, 1839) is a junior
	synonym." but this statement has problems of its own. <ol>
		<li>The reference "(Gray, 1839)" is not clear to me -- are they referring to Gray's
		contribution to the "Zool.Voy.Beagle" ?? (the only Gray reference they cite is Gray 1840
		List of Genera of Birds.</li>
		<li>It is not clear to me why this is a "replacement name", but I have not seen Gray's
		entry.</li>
		<li>From various sources including the CBBM <b>12</b>:691, it appears likely that the
		combination used by Gray was <i>Ammodramus manimbe</i> and thus the use of parentheses
		around the date and Gray's name here would be incorrect.</li>
		<li>It does not address the more important issue of the status of <i>Fringilla manimbe</i>
		Lichtenstein, 1823.</li>
		</ol>
		Additionally it must be noted that the card in the Richmond Index for <i>Ammodramus
		xanthornus</i> Gould has a note saying:<pre>
		Suppressed in favor of <u>A</u>. <u>manimbe</u>.</pre>
		though I can so far find no evidence of this suppression.</li>

	<li>Lichtenstein's 1823 name is cited by Ridgway 1898 as the type for <b>Myospiza</b>, and is
	usually cited appropriately as a junior synonym of <i>Tanagra humeralis</i> Bosc 1792. This fact
	alone does not make the name unavailable for a subspecies.</li>

	<li>The question then becomes if the Lichtenstein name can be applied to the same population as
	the Gould name, and if so it clearly has priority by 16 years.</li>

	<li>The Lichtenstein specimen is listed as coming from "Bahia", and it is difficult to know
	exactly what that meant in 1823. Today, it refer to a State in central to southern Brazil.</li>

	<li>Chapman 1912 Bull.Am.Mus.Nat.Hist. vol.31  Article XVI p.162 describes specimens of
	<i>Myospiza manimbe maninbe</i> both from Bahia (the type locality) and much farther south and
	west from Chapada in the state of Matto Grosso, fairly close to and actually south of north
	eastern Bolivia, which is the range indicated by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:785
	for <i>Myospiza humeralis xanthornus</i> Gould.</li>
	<li>It appears to me that the <b>systematic</b> problem with this species is great, and
	resolution of the nomenclatural issues must await progress on the systematic front.</li>
	<li>The Gould <i>xanthornus</i> name may well be the appropriate one for this population, but
	only if <i>manimbe</i> Lichtenstein is shown to be a synonym of <i>humeralis</i> Bosc, and
	<b>not</b> a senior synonym of <i>xanthornis</i> Gould.</li>

Melospiza melodia morphna <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<ul>
<li>Arcese, P., M. K.  Sogge, A. B. Marr, and M. A. Patten. 2002. Song Sparrow (<i>Melospiza
melodia</i>). In The Birds of North America, No. 704 (A. Poole and F.
Gill, eds.). The Birds of North America, Inc., Philadelphia, PA. comment:<pre>
<i>Melospiza melodia morphna</i> Oberholser, 1899. Name given as new name to replace preoccupied 
<i>Fringilla cinerea</i> (not of Gmelin) Audubon, 1839. </pre></li>

<li>Actually <i>Fringilla cinerea</i> is nowhere mentioned by Oberholser in his 1899 Auk note, where he writes:<pre>
<i>Fringilla guttata</i> Nuttall (Man. Orn., ed. 2, 1840, I, 581), which is now
<i>Melospiza fasciata guttata</i>, is debarred by <i>Fringilla guttata</i> Vieillot
(Nouv. Dict. d'Hist. Nat., 1817, XII, 233), for an Australian Weaver-bird.
As the Rusty Song Sparrow seems to have no other name, it may be
called <i>Melospiza melodia morphna</i>.</pre>
<li>The place the name <i>Fringilla cinerea</i> Audubon plays in this story appears to be as follows.
The type of <i>Melospiza melodia morphna</i> Oberholser is specimen #1860 in the USNM collection. It was collected by John
K.
Townsend, and received into the collection from Spencer Baird. It was in Baird's private collection and he had
in turn acquired it from Edward Harris, who had himself gotten it either from Audubon or Townsend. A <b>different</b>
Townsend specimen from his "Columbia river" material (tag # 1942) had also been in Baird's private collection, and Baird had
written on the label <pre>"Fringilla cineara of Audubon. Type of his description and figure."</pre></li>
<li>Friedmann's summary (p.664) is:<pre>
  <i>Melospiza melodia morphna</i> Oberholser is a new name for <i>guttata</i> Nuttall,
preoccupied in <i>Fringilla</i>, and is based on the same type specimen(s).
  In summary, No. 1860 is a cotype of <i>Fringilla cinerea</i> Audubon, and also
a probable cotype of <i>Fringilla guttata</i> Nuttall and of <i>Melospiza melodia morphna</i>
Oberholser; No. 1942 is a probable cotype of <i>Fringilla cinerea</i> 
Audubon, but presumably has no connection with the other two names.</pre></li>

Microcerculus <strong>Citation</strong>

<li>Conventionally cited as
<h4>Microcerculus <a href="../../bio/bios.html#Sclater,PL"
target="ref_fr">Sclater,PL</a> 1862 <i><a
href="../../cit/jourc.html#Cat.Coll.Am.Birds"
target="ref_fr">Cat.Coll.Am.Birds</a></i> p.19</h4></li>

<li>The difficulty is that if this is cited to 1862, then Microcerculus
Salvin 1861 PZS Pt2 p.202 would appear to have priority.</li>

<li>Zimmer (p.560) presents evidence (but not proof) that pp.1-192 of
Sclater's work this work may have appeared in 1861. If that is true then
the conventional citation (with the date changed to 1861) <b>may</b> be
correct, but would depend on establishing that the portion of Sclater's
publication actually preceeds Salvin's.</li>
<li>
<li>Edward Dickinson and Steven Gregory kindly provided additional
information on this (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.12.09) showing that:<br>
From CBBM, vi, p. 295:<pre>
Microcerculus, <i>Baird, Review Amer. B.</i> p. 113 (1864, <i>ex </i>Sclater, Cat. Amer. B.</i> p.19, 1862).
[Type] M. bambla. Cf. <i>Salvin &amp; Godman, Biol. Centr.-Amer., Aves</i>, i, p. 76.</pre>
 
In the Salvin &amp; Godman reference we find:<pre>
 
<i>Microcerculus</i> (section of <i>Cyphorhinus</i>), Sclater, Cat. Am. B. p.19 (1862); Baird, Rev. Am. B. i.  p.113 (1864).
(Type <i>Turdus bambla</i>, Bodd.)</pre>
 
[Steven notes]:Somewhat circular, and no mention of 1861. I also note that Boddaert's
original combination was <i>Formicarius bambla</i>, which should be included in
the citation for the genus, and not just Baird's "<i>Turdus bambla</i>".</li>
<li>Steven also notes that Schulze <i>et al.</i> (as well as Neave) cite Salvin as the author of the genus.</li>
<li>Michael Rieser provides (<i>in litt.</i> 2007.09.15) the description from the PZS:
<pre>    1. CYPHORHINUS PHILOMELA.
    Long. tot. 4, al&aelig; 2-3, caud&aelig; 1 poll. angl. et dec.
    <i>Hab.</i> In Prov. Ver&aelig; Pacis sylvis montium.
    <i>Obs.</i> Affinis <i>Cyphorhino bambl&aelig;</i> ex Cayenna, sed tectricibus alarum
	maculatis et non albo vittatis facile notabilis.
    This Wren belongs to the division of this genus which Dr. Sclater
	has classed under the name of <i>Microcerculus</i>. It is known to the
	natives as the 'Ruise&ntilde;or, ' or Nightingale -- a name it has acquired from its
	great vocal powers.</pre></li>
<li>This description is suggestive of the possibility that the name had already been
published, but it certainly does not prove that to be so.</li>

Agelaius phoeniceus mailliardorum <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>van Rossem's note on p.223 reads:<pre>Named for Messrs. John W. and Joseph Mallliard, in appreciation
of their valuable work with the Redwinged Blackbirds of California.</pre> Joseph Mailliard was (at that
time) the Curator Emeritus of Ornithology at the California Academy of Sciences. I presume, but don't know
for sure than John W. was his brother.</li>
<li>I can not restrain from adding some additional notes of interest here. My father-in-law knew Joseph
Mailliard and his son William Somers Mailliard, who was a congressional representative for California from
1953-1974. It is my understanding that Joseph Mailliard had ancestry that included paternity by Charles
Lucien Bonaparte.</li>

<li>Joseph Mailliard was a member of the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, and wrote a book "Birds of the
Bohemian Grove, Monte Rio, California". 1931. Published by A Friend of Bohemia. The eponymous subspecies
is included in the list (p.48).</li>
<li>Subsequently, another book entitled "Birds of the Bohemian Grove, Monte Rio, California" 2003. was
written (and illustrated) by Hermann Heinzel. Published by A Member of the Old Guard. The bird is there
described and illustrated (p.70) though interestingly no mention is made of the association with
Mailliard.</li>
<li>The subspecies <i>mailliardorum</i> does occur in the Bohemian Grove (I have seen it there), though
the type was collected 28 April, 1901 in Palo Alto, California by Theodore Jesse Hoover (1871-1955).
Theodore J. Hoover, one of the founding members of the Cooper Ornithological Society, was later to became
the Dean of the School of Engineering at Stanford. He would have been in his senior year at Stanford when

It seems to me that Theodore Jesse Hoover must be the brother of president Herbert Hoover, though I
have yet to find this actually stated. Both Theodore and Herbert were born (T. - Jan. 28, 1871; H. - Aug.
10, 1874) in West Branch, Iowa, and Herbert's father was named Jesse, so it seems extremely likely
that they were brothers. After his parent's death, Herbert was sent to Newburg, Oregon where he grew
up in his uncle's house. The possible separation of the boys may explain why their brotherhood may
not receive much emphasis.</li>
<li>Herbert Hoover was an ardent Bohemian, and I would guess that it is likely that Theodore was as well,
though I find no evidence of this.</li>

<li>Thanks to Daria Wingreen-Mason of the Cullman Library, I have examined an image of page 81 of
Gray's Zoological Miscellany. Gray uses the name "F. milvipes" which is followed by the number
"26". The number "26" refers either to a picture, or a specimen sent by Hodgson to the British
Museum. Therefore with some confidance I interpret the Gray publication of this name in 1844 as
<b>not</b> satisfying the requirements for it to be the citation for the taxon name.</li>

Sula dactylatra melanops <strong>Author</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):185 lists the author of this taxon as Heuglin.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index listed the author as Hartlaub, so naturally I was interested to determine which was correct.</li>
<li>Edward Dickinson examined the original description and confirmed <b>Richmond's</b> indication that Hartlaub was the
author. As a result of this the correction was made in Corrigenda #5.</li>
<li>HBW <b>1</b>:324 also listed Heuglin as the author of this taxon. I presumed that they (like H&amp;M) had simply
followed the Peters Checklist without troubling to confirm the authority -- as this is the conventional (though lazy)
practice.</li>
<li>Of interest, Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. <b>26</b>:431 is where all this may have started, as there Ogilvie-Grant lists Heuglin
rather than Hartlaub as the author. Despite the charming belief to the contrary, it appears that for a large number of
taxa, the authors of the Peters Checklist merely accepted the listings from the Cat.BirdsBr.Mus. as "holy writ" much the
way most authors today regard those from the Peters Checklist. Richmond was a worker who attended to quite a different and
higher standard.</li>
<li>Also worthy of mention is not only the 1931 publication of Mathews &and; Iredale (A Manual of Birds of Ausltrlia), but
the work by Pittman and Jehl (<cite>Pittman RL, Jehl JL Jr., 1998. The Wilson Bulletin <b>110</b>(2):155-170.</cite>).
Pittman and Jehl quote the Mathews &amp; Iredale work which appears to correctly hold Hartlaub as the author of <i>Sula

Myrmornis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>

<li>In a letter from CW Richmond to Witmer Stone (1926.02.23) Richmond indicates
that this name occurs as both <b>Myrmornis</b> and <b>Myrmornithion</b> (or
<b>Myrmornithon</b> -- it is slightly illegible) occuring in another portion of the
work. No one else seems to mention this fact.</li>
<li>Normand David (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.07.26) has looked into and resovled this matter. He writes:<pre>
 ... here are the citations from Hermann's Tabula affinitatum animalium (1783),

<b>Myrmorni- them</b>

<b>Myrmornis</b>

The nominative singular is <b>Myrmornis</b>; all other instances have different case endings 
according to Latin grammar, that must be corrected to the nominative singular 
(arts. 11.8.1 and 32.5.2.7).</pre></li>
<li>The Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:255 (1951) footnotes the variants <b>Myrmornithis</b>,

	</li>Additionally, both the Richmond Index, and
	Schulze <i>et al.</i> note that the name also
occurs in 1880 in Annuire Mus. Caen vol.<b>1</b>:224. Peters seems to have been

to me.</li>

</ul>
<li>Subsequently (2006.10.16) Michael Rieser brought to my attention an
article by Bob Mengel directly addressing this situation.<p>
Mengel RM. 1960. "Errors concerning the date and source of the name
<i>Melanotrochilus</i> Eudes-Deslongchamps (Trochilidae)." Auk
<b>77</b>:87-88.<p>
Mengel brings attention to the fact that Neave (Nomenclator Zoologicus
<b>3</b>:90, 1940) correctly indicates that the name was published earlier.
Deslongchamps (Eudes Deslongchamps) published a diagnosis of the genus and a
full account of <i>Melanotrochilus fuscus</i> (<i>Trochilus fuscus</i>
Vieillot, Nouv.Dict.Hist.Hat. <b>7</b>:348, 1817). This apparently was first
published in 1879 in Deslongchamps. "Catalogue descriptif des oiseaux du
Mus&eacute;e de Caen appartenent a la famille des Trochilid&eacute;s ou
Oiseaux-Mouches". Bulletin de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Linn&eacute;enne de
Normandie, ser.III, tom.III pp.8-325 (for 1878-1879, dated 1879 on title
page), and ser.III tom.IV (pp.324-325: noted by Mengel to be misnumbered
224-225). The genus is erected on p.314, and thus the date of 1879 is
appropriate.</li>
<li>Mengel also notes additional details, including the fact that the
article was reprinted at least twice with slight changes.</li>

Centropus menbeki <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>The question here is whether the specific epithet should be spelled
<i>menbeki</i> or <i>menebiki</i>. There seems to be agreement that the name is
spelled <i>menbeki</i> on pl.33 and <i>menebiki</i> in the text (p.600). So it is a
question of publishing history and which was published first, the text or the plate.</li>
<li>First we look to the Cat.B.Br.Mus. 1891 <b>19</b>:336 where we have
(selected)<ol>
	<li>Centropus menbeki, <i>Less. &amp; Garn. Voy. Coq., Zool. Atlas, </i> pl.33 (1826)</li>
	<li>Centropus menebikii, <i>Garn. Voy. Coq., Zool.</i> i. pt.2, p.600 (1828)</li>
	<li>Centropus menbikii, <i>Less. Man. Orn.</i> ii. p.122 (1828)</li>
	<li>Centropus menebiki, <i>Less. Trait&eacute;</i>, p.137 (1831)</li>
	</ol>
	As we will see below, the 1826 date for the plate is wrong, and is 1828.</li>
<li>Sherborn Index Animalium (p.4000) lists:<ul>
	<li>menbiki, Centropus, R.P. Lesson, Man. Orn. II. June 1828 122.</li>
	We will see that this Man.Orn. entry is also antedated (March 1828) by the plate, but in
	fact antedates the text name (Nov. 1829) which is proposed as having priority by the
	Voisin work (<i>v.i.</i>).</li>
	</ul>
<li>The Richmond Index lists:<ul>
	<li>Centropus menbeki Prosper Garnot. 1828 Voyage autour du monde, La Coquille; Zoologie
	(livr.6) Mch. 1828, pl.33.<br>
	Text, tome I , pt. II, livr. 13, Nov. 1829, 600 where <u>C.</u> <u>Menebiki</u>.</ul></li>
<li> Peters Checklist 1940 <b>4</b>:67 where the name is listed as <i>menbeki</i> citing Voy.
Coquille Atlas, 1828, pl.33; Zool., <b>1</b>, livr. 13, 1829, p.600<sup>1</sup> and the
footnote reads:<pre>
	<sup>1</sup> The specific name is spelled <i>menebiki</i> in the text, and <i>menebikii</i>
on the table of plates accompanying the Atlas.</li></pre></li>
<li>Then we have Voisin C &amp; Voisin J-F. 1999. "Liste des types d'oiseaux des collections du
Mus&eacute;um national d'Histoire naturelle de Paris. 6. Coucous (Cuculidae)." Zoosystema
<b>21</b>(2):389 where the entry reads:<pre>
<i><b>Centropus Menebiki</b></i> Garnot <i>in</i> Lesson &amp; 
Garnot, 1828.
	Garnot <i>in</i> Lesson &amp; Garnot, <i>Voyage autour du
	Monde ex&eacute;cut&eacute; par ordre du Roi sur la Corvette de

	<i>Atlas</i>, pl.33 (1838).
	<i>Centropus menebiki menebiki</i> Garnot, 1828.
	(=<i>Centropus menbeki menbeki</i> auct.)</pre>
Quite substantial differences here from other authors.</li>

<li>This confusing work (Voy. <i>Coquille</i>) is a challenge. Many studies and much careful work
has been done and published on this publication; the easiest authoritative source to consult is
Zimmer 1926 p.186-188 which benefits from prior work by Sherborn and Mathews and includes those
results. Zimmer makes it clear that the records of the "Bibliographie de la France" as
well as data from F&eacute;russac's "Bull. de Sciences Naturelles" lead to the understanding that
the Voisin's interpretation of dates, and thus which name has priority, can not be regarded as
correct. Voisin &amp; Voisin date plate 33 to "1838" which may be a typographic error, as this
is essentially 9 year later than any bird plate was published for this work.
We know from Mathews discovery in F&eacute;russac's "Bull. de Sciences Naturelles" that the date
of publication for plate 33 (in livraison 6) was 22 March 1828 (a Saturday).  Livraison 13
(containing pp.561-600 and the text name) was published Nov. 21, 1829
(also a Saturday), almost a year and a half after the plate. This is known from the records of
the "Bibliographie de la France".</li>
<li>Voisin &amp; Voisin refer to Sherborn &amp; Woodward 1906. Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist.(7)
<b>17</b>:335-336, but not to the additional later work by Mathews. 1913. AustralAvianRecord
<b>2</b>(3,4):49-54, nor to Zimmer. </li>
<li>The plate name <i>Centropus menbeki</i> has priority over the text name
<i>C.  Menebiki</i>.</li>
<li>My interpretation of Zimmer indicates that the authority for the name (on the plate) is to
Lesson &amp; Garnot, and not to Garnot <i>in</i> Lesson &amp; Garnot.</li>

<li>The Richmond Index lists this name, with the authority of Lesson &amp; Garnot to

<li>This is all very confused, and it seems that both Zimmer and Richmond can't both be right.
Richmond does not list the Voy.Coq. citation here, and apparently believed that the Ferrusac's bulletin
entry had priority. I defer to Richmond here.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:255 lists this to Lesson, 1827. Presumably this follows the Peters

to attribute authority to Lesson &amp; Garnot (!!).  Very confusing.</li>

himantopus</i>. The foot note (#7) on p.132 indicates, and Edward
Dickinson confirms (<i>in litt.</i> 2005.09.21), that the systematic
listing
follows that of HBW <b>3</b>. The basis for this would appear to boil down
to an introductory note by Pierce on p.332, where the difficulties of the
problem are presented, and the decisions taken appear to be on the basis 
that<pre> 
Most authors have preferred to accept only two species, the Black-winged
Stilt (<i>Himantopus himantopus</i>) and Black Stilt (<i>Himantopus novaezelandae</i>), 
although some consider these two forms conspecific.</pre>
This statement is made without any citations, references, or supporting
data. Whom "most authors" are is not indicated, and this appears to me to be an
erroneous extension of "prevailing usage", as applied to nomenclature, to systematics.
Perhaps in the future we can look forward to establishment of systematic relationships by a

<li>The AOU Checklist Committee considers <i>mexicanus</i> to be a
species in the absence of any published taxonomic treatment to the
contrary. (Dick Banks, <i>in litt.</i> 2005.08.31)</li>
<li>In sharp contrast to the standards of the AOU Checklist Committee, the

Anous minutus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>This name is attributed to Boie in 1844 Isis <b>37</b> col.188, note. and it appears
that this tradition of reference was established by Saunders in Cat.B.Br.Mus. <b>25</b>:145 and followed by
Mathews.</li>
<li>In a letter from CW Richmond to Witmer Stone (1915.02.05) some interesting questions are raised. 
	<ol> 
	<li>Richmond indicates that Boie describes a <i>Sterna minutus</i> from the collection
	of Prince Essling (and from some British Museums) "which is a species of <u>Anous</u> or 
	<u>Micronous</u>."</li>
	<li>Richmond also asserts that the Essling specimen is allegedly from California and 
	thus may not be Australian.</li>  
	<li>Richmond indicates that Boie lists his species of <u>Anous</u> with the 
	abbreviation <u>St.</u> and "dittos" all the species which suggests to Richmond that Boie intended to 
	call his new species <i>Sterna minutus</i> (a name which is, of course, preoccupied by <i>Sterna minuta</i>
	Linnaeus 1766 = <i>S. albifrons</i> Pallas 1764). -- but see below regarding <u>St.</u>.</li>
	<li>Richmond regards the Essling specimen as the type (as it is the only "definite one" 
	that Boie mentions).</li>
	<li>If the Essling specimen is from California it is possibly not related to the form that Matthews has in mind.</li>
	<li>If the specimen does relate to one of the forms Matthews has in mind, the name may be preoccupied,
		and Richmond suggests in such a case <i>Anous leucocapillus</i> Gould may be the appropriate 
		available name.</li>
		</ol></li>
<li>The Richmond Index, in fact, lists a card for <i>Anous minutus</i> Boie (!), but it does not
appear to be in Richmond's hand, and cites the type locality as determined by Mathews.</li>
<li>Sherborn's Index Animalium has a listing (p.4100) as follows:<pre>
<b>minuta</b>  Sternula (L.), F. Boie, Isis (Oken), 1822, 563. -- Sterna, 1766.</pre>
Suggesting that Boie may also possibly have been referring to his previous use of <i>Sternula minuta</i>.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index has a card for the genus group name 
<b>Sternula</b> F. Boie Isis (Oken) Bd. X Heft V, col.563 1822, and gives the type as "<u>minuta</u>".</li>
<li>So all this is somewhat confusing, but it appears to me (without having seen any of the primary sources) [but see below]
that Boie in 1844 was listing the species of <b>Anous</b> and included there names that he had previously held 
to be in "St." -- presumably his <b>Sternula</b>. Thus it may well be appropriate to list the authority without
parentheses <b>if</b> the type specimen is in fact <b>not</b> from California, as the Essling specimen would 
appear to be.</li>
<li>If the type specimen for this name is not from the Australasian region the entire taxon
would appear to be problematic.</li>
<li>It appears to me that further investigation of this matter is appropriate.</li>

<li>These citations are problematic and contoversial.  The dates of livr.5 do not 
appear to have been established with certainty and it is variously cited to
1830 or 1831.</li>
<li>Of interest in his description of <i>Merulaxis ater</i> evidently Lesson notes:
"Cent. Zool., pl.30" (data from Richmond Index). The Richmond Index dates that portion of
Cent. Zool. to 1831, and speculates that Lesson's note would make it likely that the
description of <i>M. ater</i> appeared first in Cent. Zool.  If this were established to 
be true, and if the 1831 date is accepted for livr.IV of Cent. Zool., then it would appear quite
certain that at least the latter pages of livr.5 of TraitedOrn. should be dated to 1831, and
not 1830.</li>
<li>However, it must be noted that at this time Lesson was working on multiple works and a confusing

simo, <i> exuli etiam cariori, amplitudine in-
genii, animi virtute, lacertorum vigore
aeque praeclaro! ... Utinam multos tales

<li>This is translated by Jobling (1991) as:<pre>
My genus is dedicated to Aloysius Masi, the very essence of Italy,
exiled yet dear, talented, intellectual, energetic, and distinguished!
Would that Italy of France could always produce such sons!</pre></li>
<li>Jobling goes on to comment: "The only candidate for this eulogy
(here freely translated from the original Latin) would seem to be
the republican Colonel Masi, a supporter of Garibaldi, but no further
details are provided."</li>
<li>Jobling must be correct in this. Of interest, <b>Luigi Masi</b> of Perugia, Italy 
was initially hired by Bonaparte as the tutor of his children. Masi
continued with the family for many many years and became Bonaparte's personal secretary, 
travelling with him to many meetings. Luigi (who would appear <b>not</b> to be Aloysius)
is mentioned many times in Stroud's 2000 Biography of Bonaparte. Aloysius Masi is not 
mentioned.</li>

Pitta sordida mulleri <strong>Spelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:322 (Mayr) renders this "<i>Pitta m&uuml;lleri</i>
in the original description, and thus spells it "<b>Pitta sordida
muelleri</b>". This <b>would</b> be appropriate, if in fact Bonaparte had
spelled it with an umlaut and the name was either German or indeterminate
as to origin.</li>
<li>I have checked two copies of the Consp.Gen.Av. and the name is spelled
"(Pitta <b>mulleri</b>, Bp.)", and thus "ue" is incorrect.</li>
<li>H&M 3<sup>rd</sup>:338 renders this name correctly.</li>
<li>Bonaparte describes this name in <b>Brachyrus</b> even though the
binomen listed is "<i>Pitta <b>mulleri</i></b>, <i>Bp.</i>". I interpret
this to be a Bp. manuscript name, but published first here.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:338 apparently follows Peters

does not appear to have attended to either the actual spelling of the name

Myiarchus magnirostris <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>An interesting nomenclatural situation applies to this name as described by
 Zimmer, 1926 p.158 <pre>
	The generic names of some of the new species have been altered to
accord with generic changes proposed herein by Gray, as, for example,
<i>Myiobius magnirostris</i>, p.48 pl.VIII. Gould's manuscript name,
<i>Tyrannula magnirostris</i>, is cited in synonomy but appears on
the plate, while the new combination is given without authority
other than that it follows Gray's proposal of <i>Myiobius</i> for
<i>Tyrannula</i> of Swainson. In this case, the authorship of the species may
remain with Gould since the plate has priority over the text (see below), but
Darwin appears to be properly the author of the new combination of names.

<li>The Richmond Index dates this to 1859, and notes that the signature is

<li>The relatively late date of the signature imprint certainly suggests that
its publication could have been delayed until 1860, though Peters gives no

volume to 1859.</li>
<li>To date I do not have data from the Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus. (where I suspect
Sclater may have gotten his date for the <i>Syst.Av.Aethiop.</i>).</li>
<li>If 1860 is correct (which I suspect may well be the case) the implication
here is that either Th.II was issued in parts (presumably signatures) or the
entire volume would have to be dated to 1860. This last case would affect quite
a few taxa, and might have substantial priority implications.</li>

<li>Cannings RJ &amp; Angell T. 2001. Birds of North America. No. 597 Western Screech Owl. p.3

the largest.</li>
<li>The type for <i>macfarlanei</i> was collected in my home town (Walla Walla, WA). [[2010.06.12] 
Initially I thought this was collected by Wm. Brewster, but I think Brewster was probably
not in Walla Walla in 1881. Brewster comments in his Bull.Nutt.Orn.Club article on birds
of the Fort Walla Walla vicinity, that Bendire sent him his collection of birds from that 
region, and encouraged Brewster to publish any findings of interest.] The bird was collected
on Oct. 22 1881, by Capt. Charles Bendire.
Capt. Bendire was stationed at Ft. Walla Walla 
from June 1878 until May 1882. (Fort Walla Walla, given as the type locality for
a number of subspecies, actually occupied 3 locations, from its inception to the current day. When
Capt. Bendire served there it was located at it's current location where it
now functions as a Veterans Administration Hospital, and where Western Screech Owls 
-- quite abundant in Walla Walla -- can be heard to this day on the grounds.)</li>
<li>The bird was named for "Mr Robert Macfarlane who, as is well known, was a personal friend
of Robert Kennicott and an enterprising and accomplished field ornithologist."</li>
<li>Coues (KeyN.A.Birds p.634) lists Macfarlane as a member of the Hudson Bay Company.</li>

  <i>Hab.</i> ---?
  This species of Corythaix lived for some time in the Society's
Menagerie, having been purchased from a dealer who was unac-
quainted with its locality.
  Compared with the known species of the genus, it approaches
most nearly to the <i>Corythaix Persa</i> of authors, but from this it may
readily be distinguished by its smaller size; and the form, compara-
tively large size and colouring of the beak.  The colouring of the
plumage also differs in some respects: like <i>C. Persa</i>, the head, neck
and breast are green, but the feathers on these parts are of a deeper
hue than in that species; the feathers of the crest, instead of being
simply tipped with white, having a white transverse line near the
apex, but <i>at</i> the apex they are purple-black.  Minute black feathers
encircle the eye, and a white stripe extends from beneath the eye
on to the ear.  The beak is much arched above, and somewhat in-
flated at the base; the nostrils are very large, and not hidden, as in
<i>C. Persa</i>, by the decumbent feathers, these extending only to the
posterior angle of the nostril.  The upper mandible is of a bright 
yellow color, excepting all that portion which lies below and be-
hind the nostrils, which is of a brilliant red colour; the lower mandi-
ble is of the same red tint, but tipped with yellow.  Both mandi-
bles present simple sharp-cutting edges, in this respect exhibiting a
different structure from that observable in the the allied species, <i>C. Persa</i>
and <i>C. Buffonii</i>, in which the mandibles have their cutting edges
serrated.  The back and upper surface of the wings are of a deep
purple-blue tint, exhibiting in certain parts greenish reflections.
The primaries (with the exception of the first quill) and second-
aries (with the excpetion of the three of four innermost quills) are
red, margined with black; the shafts of these feathers are also black.
The outer primary is black, and the two or three following feathers
are broadly margined externally with the same colour.  All the 
wing feathers are black at the base; on the outermost feathers the
black colouring occupies but little space, but in each successive
feather it increases in extent.  The feathers of the tail are of a very
dark green colour above, inclining to black; beneath they are black,
but exhibit indistinct purple reflections.  The rump, upper and un-
der tail-coverts, thighs, and vent are black, obscurely tinted with
purple or green in parts.  The tarsi are black.  The eyes are hazel,
and the naked, or almost naked space around the eye, is of a crimson
colour; not carunculated, as in <i>C. Buffonii</i> and <i>C. leucotis</i>.

Macronous <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>There are interesting uncertainties here regarding the spelling of
this name. <b>Macronous</b> vs. <b>Macronus</b></li>
<li>To date (2003.05.02) best summarized by this portion of
an email from Normand David:<pre>

Macronus/Macronous Jardine &amp; Selby (Illustrations of Ornithology, 1835, Vol. III, pl.150) 
The plate has <b>Macronus</b> and the the text has <b>Macronous</b>.
The index of volume <b>III</b> (the only vol. of four that has an index) in which the plate was
bound has <b>Macronus</b>.

All references cited by the Cat.B.Br.Mus. that I have seen have <b>Macronus</b> 
(from Grays 1841 "Genera..." to Sharpe's 1903 "Handlist ..." + various minor papers in
Ibis, PZSL, BBOC), except for Blyth 1842 (JASB <b>11</b>:795) and Blyth 1849 
(Cat. Birds Mus As. Soc.).

All indications show that <b>Macronus</b> was in overwhelming use from 1835
until 1963 and 1964, when Deignan (1963, Check-list Birds Thailand) used
<b>Macronous</b> with no explanation); in Peters (1964) <b>X</b>:318, he (Deignan) 
invoked Blyth's 1842 "Macronous" as a First Reviser action (but it does not meet
the requirements of the Code), despite the fact that "the editors would
prefer to maintain this more frequently used spelling [=Macronus]".

Did anyone else acted as First Reviser?

Perhaps the answer lies in Proc. Biol. Soc Wash. (1905) <b>18</b>:4, where
Mearns established <i>Macronous mindanensis montanus</i>; or Chasen 1935, A
Handlist of Malaysian Birds (Bull Raffles Museum <b>11</b>:1-389), or Deignan
1950 (Bull Raffles Museum <b>23</b>:127-129, where he introduced <i>Macronus
striaticeps mearnsi</i>.

These publications [must still be checked]...

I note that Wolters (1982, Vogelarten der Erde) used <b>Macronus</b> instead of
"<b>Macronous</b>" (which he cites).

Unless we find something else, it seems that Deignan was the first
author to use <b>Macronous</b> consistently at one point in time. I think now
this is unfortunate because <b>Macronus</b> was much more frequent and closer
to the etymology (<i>onyx</i>, claw; not <i>ous</i>, ear).

On the other hand, can we say that Deignan in Peters acted as First
Reviser? He cited <b>Macronous</b> (text to plate) and <b>Macronus</b> (plate), and
used <b>Macronous</b>. I am not sure yet if this meets [the] Art. 24.2.3 phrase 
"selected one spelling as correct".

		however there is some uncertainty
		here. Using bibliographic tools and library searches, I have not identified with
		certainty the entity "Mittheilungen des Ornithologischen Vereins [Vereines] in Wien". I
		suspect that this may be the title of a subsection of a larger work.</li>
		<li>The Richmond Index gives the source as:
		<ul><li>"Sonntagsb. d. Norddeutsch. Allgemein. Zeitung no.37, 16 Sept. 1883" <br>
		with a note saying:<br>
		'orig. diag. ? repr. in J.f.O. 1883, 399.<br>
		Mitth. des Orn.. Vereines in Wien, VII, no.10 Oct., 1883 p.202 (in text).'</li>
		<li>On a second card detailing the J. fur Orn. 1884 listing is a note in Richmond's hand
		stating:<br>
		'probably first described in a newspaper - "Norddeutschen  Allg. Zeitung."<br>
		no.37 of Sept. 16, 1883!'<br>
		This "probably" is written above a "possibly" which is crossed out.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>There was a German newspaper "Norddeutsche allgemeine Zeitung" published 1870-1942 which
	would appear to be the paper referred to.</li>
	<li>By date, this would certainly appear to have priority, and if it satisfies the
	requirements for adequacy of description would appear to be the appropriate citation.</li>
	<li>My guess is that Richmond did not actually <b>see</b> the Norddeutsh. Allg. Zeitung
	entry. His changing "possibly" to "probably" suggests he got some additional information, but
	NOT certainty regarding this question.
	</li>
	<li>Norbert Bahr helpfully writes (2009.12.13):<pre> 
	In his work "Die V&ouml;gel Afrikas", Reichenow cited 
	first his publication in the newspaper `Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung"
	, supporting that that article has priority over the description in 
	Mitt. Orn. Ver. Wien, and perhaps the source on which Richmond 
	based his change from `possibly' to `probably' (?).</pre></li>
	<li>The No.37 Sonntagsblatt evidently has an imprint date of
	16 Sept. 1883 (a Sunday), but was published on Saturday
	15 Sept. 1883, based on Reichenow's note in the DieVog.Afr. (vol.1
	p.12).</li>

Centrocercus minimus <strong>Nomenclature  </strong>
<ul>
<li>I previously followed the AOU.<cite> 42<sup>nd</sup> supplement
to the AOU Checklist Auk 2000. 117(3):850.</cite> for the citation, which was: <ul>
<li>Centrocercus minimus <a href="../../bio/biob.html#Bradbury" target="ref_fr">Bradbury</a>

</ul>

<li>I now follow the AOU.<cite> 43<sup>rd</sup> supplement to the AOU Checklist Auk 2002.
119(3):899.</cite></li>
<li>A complex and unfortunate situation exists here. I
understand this name, though unpublished, was used informally for
some time. The Bradbury and Vehrencamp publication of the name
was not intended as the species description, but nonetheless was
interpreted by Banks, and others who have reviewed the data and
the applicable rules, as satisfying the ICZN rules then in
effect, and was thus, whether advertent or not, a valid species
description.</li>
<li>Shortly after that publication, the new 4<sup>th</sup> ICZN rules came into
effect and the description would <b>NOT</b> then have satisfied the criteria.</li>

<li>Those who worked on recognition of the taxon published their work in the last 2000 issue
of <cite>The Wilson Bulletin</cite>, where they described it as as "new species", and did
<b>NOT</b> cite the Bradbury and Vehrencamp work, <b>OR</b> the AOU checklist update's use
of the name as a Bradbury and Vehrencamp taxon.</li>

<li>I understand that there was some consideration to petition the
ICZN to  suppress the Bradbury and Vehrencamp work (which had
unquestioned priority) and thus have their work (being the next
available) as the citation.</li>
<li>The action of the AOU Checklist Committee may make this moot.
The Checklist Committee held that the name was used by Vehrencamp
and Bradbury as "a means of temporary reference and not for
formal taxonomic use as a scientific name in zoological
nomenclature," and thus was excluded under ICZN 1985 Art.1(b)(6)
and ICZN 1999 Art. 1.3.5.</li>

<li>This would appear to be a lesson and a motivator to remember the
importance of publishing and establishing valid names so they can
be used by the scientific community in a uniform and consistent
manner.</li>

<li>An additional point:<ul>
<li>I can not understand Young <i>et al.</i>'s motivation for <b>NOT</b> mentioning either
Bradbury &amp; Vehrencamp, <b>OR</b> the initial findings of the AOU Checklist Committee in
their WilsonBull. article of description.  I <b>can</b> understand their disappointment, and
concern over the problem, but by not mentioning the issue in their WilsonBull. paper they
ensure that the nomenclatural issue will be more difficult to understand when people in the
future look back on this name. In addition, in my view, it produces the possibility of an
interpretation of petulance, rather than a desire to resolve and clarify a nomenclatural
issue.</li></ul>

Melanopareia maranonica <strong>Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listed by Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:282 as a full species.</li>
<li>Sibley &amp; Monroe suggest possibly a full species, (and use the
form <i>M.  maranonic<b>a</b></i>).
<li>The genus group name <b>Melanopareia</b> ends in the transliterated
Greek word <big>&pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha;</big> [pareia:
cheek] which is feminine. Thus Sibley &amp; Monroe's interpretation that
the form should be <i>maranonic<b>a</b></i>. However the specific
epithet is based on the Rio Mara&ntilde;on, and thus may be a noun in
apposition.  Chapman described the species as <i>maranonicus</i> but for
the moment I use <i>maranonica</i>.</li>
<li>This approach is supported by Normand David who writes (2002.10.23):
"Although formed from the Rio Mara&ntilde;on, the name
<i>maranonicus</i> of Chapman is necessarily adjectival because ending
in the adjectival suffix <i>-icus</i>, just like
<i>amazonicus/amazonica</i> from the Amazon River. Because
<b>Melanopareia</b> is feminine, <i>maranonicus</i> needs the mandatory
correction to <i>maranonica</i>."</li>


<li>Has been treated as a subspecies of <i>M. elegans</i>, but they
differ morphologically and are allopatric (see Rigdely &amp; Tudor,
1994, and Sibley 1996).</li>

<li>Nevertheless, this taxon is usually cited to 1808 (e.g. Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:266 (Traylor)

to Shaw, as opposed to Peters "Shaw &amp; Nodder" but leaves the date issue unaddressed.</li>
<li>Not surprisingly, the Richmond Index dates this to Feb. 1809, a date that Sherborn himself was
eventually able to understand himself was correct; a vision that yet awaits the Peters Checklist and its
followers.</li>

presents an analysis of the genus. I interpreted them to argue that the geographical, morphological,
and genetic evidence supported the treatment of <i>molybdophanes</i> as a full species. This was
based mainly on their statement 
(p.621) <pre> "Furthermore, in addition to these adaptational differences, there are reports
indicating interbreeding difficulties between them (Brown et al. 1982, Lewis and Pomeroy 1989). This
supports published suggestions that <i>molybdophanes</i> is phenotypically the most distinct of
the Ostrich subspecies, and that separate species status may be warranted (Brown et al. 1882, Lewis
and Pomeroy 1989), an observation which is strengthened by the magnitude of sequence divergence
between <i>molybdophanes</i> and other Ostrich lineages detected in our study." </pre></li>

<hr><A name="Myophonus"></a>
<p>
Myophonus <strong>spelling  </strong>
<p>
I include below (a slightly edited) text of Rolf de By's discussion of the spelling
of this name.  [98.02.16]
<pre>

Myiophonus species
	Myophonus species ** S/M has Myiophonus; Peters X p. 140 disc. spell.
What I write here, is the outcome of a discussion I helped
organize, but the hard work (literature review) was done by others.  Clearly,
there have been four ways of spelling. On the issue of My[i]ophon[e]us, S&amp;M write:
"This genus has been spelled in various ways, most frequently Myiophoneus,
Myophonus, and Myophoneus; Biswas (1961: 670) and Deignan (1965) used the
correct spelling."  Issue settled, it seems.  Not so.  BTW, all spellings are in
regular use, it seems.  Utter confusion.
If it's any help, according to my interpretation the three possible names mean:
  Myophonus		"Mouse-voiced"
  Myiophonus		"Fly-voiced"
  Myiophoneus		"Fly-murderer"
I know, this is no proof, but I do feel (if you know the birds; largish blue thrushes)
the top translation makes most sense.  Here's what Tim Inskipp eventually wrote,
and what to my eyes seemed the killer:

> The genus was described by Temminck in 1822 in Nouveau receuil de planches 
> coloriees d'oiseaux. 
> 
> Sibley &amp; Monroe (1990, Distribution and taxonomy of birds of the world) used 
> the spelling Myiophonus, stating that:
> 
> `This genus has been spelled in various ways, most frequently Myiophoneus, 
> Myophonus and Myophoneus; Biswas (1961: 670) and Deignan (1965) used the 
> correct spelling.'
> 
> However, Biswas (1961) used the spelling Myiophoneus, explaining in a 
> footnote that:
> 
> `Vaurie (1959a, p. 415) has reverted back to the spelling Myophonus. It is 
> true that on the explanation of pl. 170 of Temminck &amp; Laugier's Planches 
> color., livr. 29 (1822) the generic name is spelt as Myophonus, but two pages 
> preceding it, where the genus is described, it is spelt as Myiophoneus.'
> 
> Ripley (1964, Subfamily Turdinae in Check-list of birds of the world, 10) 
> gave the citation for the genus as:
> 
>  'Myiophoneus Temminck 1822, Pl. Col., livr. 29, pl. 170. Type, by original 
> designation, Turdus flavirostris Horsfield.'
> 
> He explained in a footnote that:
> 
> 'Temminck (ibid.), in his generic description, spells the new genus 
> Myiophoneus, and on the following page accompanying plate 170 spells it 
> "Myophonus."'
> 
> Deignan (1965) gave a characteristically detailed summary of the situation: 
> 
> 'The first citation for Genus Myophonus Temminck should read: Myophonus 
> Temminck, 1822 (Dec.) Pl. Col., livr. 29, pl. 170 and text. Type, by 
> monotypy, Myophonus metallicus Temminck. (The plate is lettered Myophone 
> luisant).
>    The name next appears in literature as Myiophonus Boie, 1829, Isis, p. 
> 1029, lapsus or nomen emendatum.
>    Its third guise, accompanied by a proper generic diagnosis, is Myiophoneus 
> Temminck, 1832 (post Mch. 2), Pl. col., livr. 29, p. [211].
>    At this third appearance the genus is expanded to include, in addition to 
> M. flavirostris (Horsfield), 1821 (May), with which M. metallicus Temminck, 
> 1822, is now synonymized; also:-
>    (1) Myophonus Horsfieldii Vigors, 1831 (Mch. 2), corrupted to Myiophoneus 
> [sic] Horsfeldii [sic];
>    (2) Myophonus Temminckii Vigors, 1832 (Mch. 2), changed to Myiophoneus 
> [sic] Temminckii;
>    (3) Pitta glaucina Temminck, 1823 (Apr.), here listed as Myiophoneus [sic] 
> glaucinus and cited from pl. 190 [sic] (correctly, pl. 194).
>    The footnote on page 140 of Peters' Volume X states that the generic name 
> should be "Myiophoneus," because it so appears, emendated from Myophonus, on 
> the page (properly sheet) preceding the description of Myophonus metallicus 
> Temminck, 1822.
>    Since, however, that preceding sheet cites species named in April 1823, on 
> 2nd March 1831, and on 2nd March 1832, it could not have been issued prior to 
> 2nd March 1832 (as a replacement of an earlier and discarded sheet?). There 
> is then no such name as "Myiophoneus Temminck and Laugier, 1822", as supposed 
> by Delacour (Auk, 1942, p. 246) and by the revisor of the whistling-thrushes 
> for Peters' Check-list.
>    To complete the confusion, we find Temminck using, in the Tableau 
> Methodique of January 1839, which summarizes the Planches Coloriees, both 
> Myophonus and Myiophoneus on the same page 15!
>    If stability in ornithological nomenclature be considered desirable, why 
> are we asked to use a so-called emendation (in fact a wholly new generic 
> name!) that first appeared in print some ten years after the simple, easily 
> spelled and easily pronounced Myophonus Temminck of 1822?'
> 
> I have cited all this because it is a good example of how often authors 
> misquote or misinterpret previously published works. Note that Deignan's plea 
> was apparently ignored by many recent world checklists: Clements (1991: 
> Myiophonus), Howard &amp; Moore (1980, 1984, 1991: Myiophoneus), Walters (1980: 
> Myiophoneus).

Bubo magellanicus <strong>Systematics and Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>

<li>A complex systematic and nomenclatural situation.</li>
<li>Recently summarized (<i>in litt.</i> 2004.05.15) by Norbert Bahr, who reviewed and translated
two of the recent papers relating to these questions.
For the present, I interpret the implications of these works (<i>v. i.</i>) to favor the
intepretation that <i>Bubo magellanicus</i> should be held to be a species distinct from <i>Bubo
virginianus</i>.</li>

<li>Norbert's email (with slight editing) is below, and is followed by my previous notes on this
taxon.
<pre>
 ... I can help you with translations of the K&ouml;nig et al. (1996) as well
as the Weick (1999) articles on American Bubo, as I have both these papers at
hand. I will start with an extended summary of the paper by K&ouml;nig et al. (1996).

<li>K&ouml;nig, C., P. Heidrich &amp; M. Wink (1996): Zur Taxonomie der Uhus (Strigidae: Bubo
spp.) im s&uuml;dlichen S&uml;damerika. Stuttgarter Beitr. Naturk., Ser. A, Nr. 540, 1-9
[Taxonomy of Great Horned Owls (Strigidae: Bubo spp.) in southern South 
America.]

According to Amadon &amp; Bull (1988) there is only one <b>Bubo</b> species in the whole
American continent from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego: <i>Bubo virginianus</i>. Traylor
[Auk 75: 143-148 (1958)] studied variation and races of the Great Horned Owl in 
South America and came to the conclusion that the form east of the Andes must be 
<i>Bubo virginianus nacurutu</i>, whereas the birds of Patagonia, Chile, and of the
Andes from Tierra del Fuego to Peru should be called <i>B. v. magellanicus</i>. Indeed,
<i>nacurutu</i> and <i>magellanicus</i> are rather different: they have very obvious
differences in bill and foot dimensions, and in the barring of the underparts. 
Fjeldsa &amp; Krabbe (1990) used the name <i>magellanicus</i> for the smaller taxon from
Patagonia and the southern Andes.
It would be a surprise that a subspecies occuring in sub-arctic Patagonia and 
the High Andes is smaller than a [sister] subspecies living in warmer climatic
conditions, and indeed, compared to other subsp. of <i>virginianus</i>, <i>magellanicus</i> is
a dwarf form. Besides these morphological differences, the vocalizations of both 
Bubo forms are quite distinct. The Great Horned Owl is called 'nacurut&uacute;' in
Argentinia, but 'tuc&uacute;quere' in Chile, apparently an onomatopetic transcription
of the calls of these birds.

<b>Morphologic and bioacoustic comparison of the forms <i>magellanicus</i> and <i>nacurutu</i>.</b>
<i>B. magellanicus</i> is small, has a relatively small bill (culmen under 43 mm) and
comparatively small feet. Below, this taxon [is] barred very narrowly light and dark.
There are light morphs showing much white, but there are also rather dark morphs 
with a brownish main color.
The wings are, according to Traylor, in males from Chile and Argentinia on 
average 329,0 mm (318-339), in females 342,9 mm (330-358). Birds from the Andes 
of Bolivia and Peru are somewhat larger (wings 351-380 mm); the bill is on 
average 38,0 mm in males and 39,3 mm in females. Birds in the Stuttgart 
collection agree with these measurements.
If one compares living birds side by side, so the different culmen and talon 
measurements are very obvious [ther are photos of pairs of both forms in the 
paper which show these differences very impressive!]. Further on, both taxa have 
different 'faces' and feather ears (longer in <i>nacurutu</i>).
Still more impressive are the differences in songs of both taxa. Both sexes of 
<i>magellanicus</i> sing in duet, the male uttering a double-call "wu-bh" with a
quiet tremolo on "o": "wu-bh-worrrr". 'Tucquere' is a good circumscription of 
this vocalization. The female sings similarily, but the tremolo is a little 
longer.
The <i>nacurutu</i> subsp. of <i>virginianus</i> is a little larger than <i>magellanicus</i>, with
large feet and a stronger bill. Barring is not as narrow and the facial 
expression is more "wild", caused by the longer feather ears and the strong bill.
Wing length in 15 males is 341,4 mm on average (330-354), in 21 females 363,1 mm 
(240-376); the strong bill is about 45,6 mm in 14 males and 48,8 mm in 20 females.
Pairs vocalize in duets also. The song of males is like "wu-bub&uacute; buh buh" in
females like "wu-bubub&uacute;" followed by a drawn-out "buh". The first part of the
females song is fairly good circumscribed with 'nja-curut&uacute;'.

<b>Molecular biological results</b>
Heidrich and Wink conducted a sequence analysis of the mt cytochrome b genes in 
their laboratory. Material was used from blood and feathers and by PCR they 
amplified 960 base pairs. Nucleotide sequences differed in 15 positions (1,6%), 
according to about 800 000 years when using the 2% rule. Both taxa are 
apparently sibling species, comparable to the differentiation of Spotted and 
Lesser Spotted Eagles (<i>Aquila clanga</i>, <i>A. pomarina</i>) or the Imperial and Spanish
Imperial Eagles (<i>A. heliaca</i>, <i>A. adalberti</i>).

<b>Discussion</b>
As vocalizations are likely the most important mechanisms of isolation in owls, 
it seems highly probable that <i>B. magellanicus</i> and <i>B. virginianus</i> are good
species. Genetic distances not only confirm this assumption, but also confirm 
the hypothesis that vocalizations in owls are of special importance for owl 
taxonomy.
The form <i>nacurutu</i> apparently represents a subspecies of <i>Bubo virginianus</i>,
distributed in North and most of South America. It occurs in southern South 
America east of the Andes, where it has its southern limits in the Province of 
Buenos Aires.
<i>Bubo magellanicus</i> is relatively common in Tierra del fuego and Patagonia, where
it lives in mountainous habitats. There it occurs in loosely wooded areas of 
southern beech as well as in mountains. It is distributed northward on the
Pacific slope (Chile) as well as in the central part (high-andine) of the Andes 
of Peru, agreeing with Traylor's findings of <i>magellanicus</i>. In the eastern slopes
of the Andes an overlapping zone of both species may be found, where <i>B.
magellanicus</i> apparently prefers rocky areas.</li>

<li>Weick, F. (1999): Zur Taxonomie der Amerikanischen Uhus (Bubo spp). Unter
Ber&uuml;cksichtigung eines gr&ouml;tenteils parallel variierenden Polymorphismus
innerhalb der Subspecies. kologie der Vgel 21: 363-387
[Taxonomy of the American Great horned Owls (Bubo spp) with consideration of a 
mostly parallel variation within the polymorphic subspecies.]

The author was studying specimens of New World <b>Bubo</b> in preparation for the
plates of Knig et al. (Owls) in several museums, where he found a enormous 
variability  in plumages within populations. The evident polymorphism is obvious 
in most subspecies and varies parallel among taxa. Without knowledge of the 
locality of collection, many specimens are impossible to classify correctly. 
Original descriptions of subspecies are of little help, as they were often based 
on too few specimens of the same color morph. Most authors do not mention color 
morphs in Great Horned Owls at all, an exception is Oberholser's paper of 1904.

<b>Comments on taxonomy</b>
New World Bubo are an interesting group with a complicated taxonomy, determined 
by the following factors:<ul>
<li>a. with some exceptions, there is relatively few material of these birds
available. In zoos and in private collections of living birds the number of 
individuals and subspecies is limited.</li>
<li>b. polymorphy, the existence of two or more color morphs, shows parallel
variation among subspecies; this means that there are very similarely colored
birds in different distrubutional areas. The scale light-intermediate-dark birds 
is often shifted from one subspecies to the other. The light morph of one subsp. 
can be similar to the intermediate or dark morphs of another subsp.</li>
<li>c. a number of well described subspecies, of relatively small populations, is
surrounded often by a number of variants occupying a larger area.</li>
<li>d. there are broad zones of intergradation with intermediate populations between
races.</li>
</ul>

<b>Comments on distribution, size and coloration</b>
The species is distributed from the west coast of Alaska, over subarctic boreal 
areas of Canada, parts of the tundras of Canada and Labrador, to Middle and 
South America and Tierra del Fuego. It is lacking on the Queen Charlotte Is., 
the West Indies, and larger areas of the South American lowland rain forests.
Some insular areas of occurence within these areas are little known. There are 
some obvious clines in size and coloration in agreement with Bergmann's and 
Gloger's rules. 

<b>Color morphs and intermediate populations</b>
As mentioned above, each subspec. has its typical morph, but there are one or 
more other morphs detectable. Often these morphs agree well with morphs of other 
subsp., but not always in size and proportions. There are two color plates 
showing the different morphs and subspecies, and two maps depicting the 
distribution of the subsp.
Checking of the collecting localities and breeding places revealed that several 
described subsp. are only morphs of other subsp. So is <i>lagophonus</i> only a synonym
of <i>saturatus</i> (the latter is given as restricted to a small coastal area in
western North America, but it occurs also in the interior of Brit. Columbia). 
Weick found large areas of secondary contact between the forms <i>wapacuthu,
heterocnemis, occidentalis</i> and <i>virginianus</i>, where intermediate populations are
found. Smaller areas of introgrssion are known between <i>virginianus</i> and
<i>pallescens</i>, <i>pallescens</i> and <i>pacificus</i>, and <i>pacificus</i> and <i>saturatus</i>.

<b>Comments on earlier publications</b>
Weick has reviewd the literature on Amer. Bubo (Oberholser 1904; Kelso & Kelso 
1934, Eck &amp; Busse 1973, Voous 1988, Peters 1940 and many more; Karalus & Eckart 
1974 listed all what is known on described subsp., resulting in up to three 
subsp. for one and the same area!)

<li>A complex situation here. (Thanks to Normand David for most of the details on
this).</li>
<li>The argument for recognition of the form as distinct from <i>B. virginianus</i> 
is put forward by:<ul>
	<li><cite>Konig, C., P. Heidrich &amp; M. Wink. 1996. Zur Taxononie der Uhus (Strigidae:
Bubo spp.) im sudlichen Sudamerika.Stuttgarter Beitrage zur Naturkunde.
Ser. A, Nr. 540, 1-9.</cite><p>

The abstract reads:<p>

"<i>Bubo magellanicus</i> is much smaller than true <i>viginianus</i> 
(e.g. spp.  <i>nacurutu</i>), with rather small talons and a small bill. 
Beyond that the barring of the underside is finer. The most striking 
difference is being found in vocalizations: <i>B. magellanicus</i> 
and <i>B. virginianus</i> have totally different songs. The differences 
have beeen secured by DNA-evidence (PCR, DNA-sequences), as both species 
differ by nucleotide substitutions of 1.6%.  Subspecific differences 
normally vary between 0 and 1% nucleotide substitutions."</ul></ul>

The nomenclature iincludes the following issues.<ul>

<li>HBW <b>5</b>:185 gives the citation as J.F. Gmelin, 1788.</li>
<li>The Richmond index card for Strix magellanicus Gmelin, 1788 has the handwritten 
written notes. "not citable from Gmelin" and "Possibly in Latham 1790?".</li>
<li>The Richmond index also has a card:<br>

p.202</li>
<li>Claus Konig,Friedhelm Weick and Jan-Hendrik Becking. In their 1999 book Owls of the
World give Lesson, 1828.</li>

<li>In Cat.BirdsBrit.Mus. <b>II</b>:29 (=Sharpe 1875), under <i>Bubo magellanicus</i>,
the synonymy is as follows:

<li>The issue of nomenclature here has been previously addressed:

Traylor 1958 (<cite>Auk <b>75</b>:143-149</cite>) Variation in South American Great Horned
Owls, recognized four subspecies of <i>Bubo virginianus</i>: <i>magellanicus</i>,
<i>nacurutu</i>, <i>nigrescens</i>, <i>deserti</i>. 
He commented on the nomenclature as follows:<br>
All birds were previously treated under <i>magellanicus</i> Gmelin 1788;
Oberholser 1908 (<cite>Science Bulletin 1, no 14: 371-374, Mus. Brooklyn Inst.
Arts Sci.</cite>) showed that Gmelin used the name in a varietal or descriptive
sense, and that therefore the earliest name available was <i>nacurutu</i> Vieillot 1817. 
(Oberholser's paper not seen by APP or ND at this time (2001.01.21)).<p>

Traylor argues that Vieillot's <i>nacurutu</i> is a composite from Buffon's Hibou
des terres magellaniques and Azara's nacurutu, and further that <i>nacurutu</i> must be
restricted to Paraguay (and/or Rio de la Plata, Argentina), and that a name
is needed for the birds west of the Andes. <p>
"The earliest available name appears to be Lesson's 1828: 116 validation of Gmelin's <i>magellanicus</i> with a
reference to Buffon and a description".<p>

Under <i>Bubo virginianus magellanicus</i> (Lesson 1828), Traylor gives:
<i>Strix magellanicus</i> Lesson 1828 Man. d'Orn. <b>1</b>:116.<p>

<!--Since <b>Strix</b> is feminine, Traylor should have corrected the name to <i>Strix
magellanic<b>a</b></i> (mandatory correction for gender agreement). On the other hand,
<i>magellanicus</i> cannot be attributed to Lesson. Lesson indicated "strix
magellanicus, Gm", therefore attributing magellanicus to Gmelin. On the
other hand, Lesson introduced the genus "XXXIVe Genre. Hibou, asio Briss.,
otus, Cuv.; strix, auct.". Thus the CBBM synonym "Asio magellanicus Less.
Man. d'orn. 1: 116" is explained.-->

<!--If Oberholser (1908) is right, i.e. that Gmelin's magellanicus is
unavailable (note that HBW 5: 185 gives the citation as "[Strix]
magellanicus Gmelin 1788"), and if Lesson's magellanicus never existed,
then another name must be looked for or introduced.-->

It would appear that (Lesson, 1828) is the correct citation here.
<p>

Murry Bruce adds additional information to this puzzle: (email 2001.05.11)<p>
"<i>Bubo magellanicus</i>: The citation for this name was one of the 
queries I examined for HBW <b>5</b>, so I'm responsible for having it cited to Gmelin.  
I studied the issues you discuss and the question of it being a 
varietal name was considered (I even sent a photocopy of the relevant 
page from my copy of Gmelin to HBW).  I reasoned that there are 
inconsistencies in the recognition of varietal names from Gmelin, 
but as demonstrated by Lesson, Cat. BM, etc., this has gone on for a 
long time. <ul> 
<li>If Oberholser was the first to change Gmelin's name, was this 
Richmond's influence or vice versa?</li>  
<li>Was this influenced by changes to the rules of nomenclature at the time? </li>

<li>Edward C. Dickinson writes (2004.09.25)
<pre>
The problem with [Amadon's] reasoning is that Deignan (1960) resurrected
the name before the first edition of the Code appeared in 1961. In Article
23 of the 1963 Code the form used was 'After 1960 a zoologist who
discovers such a name is to refer it to the Commission'. It follows that
an action in 1960 is not covered by the Code and Deignan's resurrection of
this name must stand.</pre></li>

Porphyrio martinica <strong>Spelling  </strong>
<ul>
<li>Originally as <i>Fulica martinica</i>.</li>
<li>Sibley and Monroe have as <i>Porphyrio martinicus</i>
It appears to me that it is a noun in apposition, and 
I favor the likelihood that <i>P. martinica</i>
will be seen as correct.</li>

<li>Norman David writes (2001.03.12).<br>
<b>Porphyrio</b> is masculine. The word <i> martinicensis</i> is definitely adjectival
(masculine and feminine; neuter: <i>martinicense</i>).<br>

But <i>martinica</i> appears a noun in apposition (a place name), as the several
African place names combined with <b>Cisticola</b>. <i>Porphyrio martinica</i> may be
correct. The original name <i>martinica</i> (and several others, e.g. <i>dominica</i>,
<i>cajanea</i>,<i> guinea</i>, etc.) are problematic. They must be studied together, and
I plan to do that in the near future.<p>

Note, however, that the suffix <i>-us</i>, <i>-a</i>, <i>-um</i> is adjectival when added to a
noun ending with a consonant (e.g., <i>hainanus</i>, <i>hainana</i>, <i>hainanum</i>, from
Hainan). Thus, <i>martinicus</i> could be viewed as a modified noun, not as an
adjective. But I am not yet 100% sure.</li>

</li>
<li>Pachecho JF &amp; Whitney BM. 2006. "Mandatory changes to the scientific names of three
Neotropical birds" BBOC <b>126</b>(3):242-244. suggest that the use of
<i>sclateri</i> was based on Peters belief that <i>Psittacula
modesta</i> Cabanis 1848 was a secondary junior homonym of
<i>Psittacula modesta</i> (Fraser, 1845). The latter is, of course,
actually <i>Palaeornis modestus</i> Fraser 1845 PZS Pt13 no.144
p.16., though Pachco &amp; Whitney do not give the original
combination.</li>

<li>Pacheco and Whitney indicate that Fraser's name and Cabanis' name
"appl[y] the name <i>modesta</i> to different nominal genera
(<i>Psittacula</i>Cuvier, 1800 [type: <i>Psittacus alexandri</i>
Linnaeus] and <i>Psittacula</i> Illiger, 1811 [type: <i>Psittacus
passerinus</i> Linnaeus])"</li>
<li>I am still working to understand if this rationale is correct.</li>
<li>Thus it seems that: <ol>
	<li>1845 Fraser described <i>Palaeornis modesta</i>, this bird has
	no type locality (it was a caged bird) but is presumed (based on
	who knows what?) to be an Australasian parrot from Engano
	Island.</li>
	<li>This taxon was subsequently (?when ?by whom) placed in
	<b>Psittacula</b>, and at least some believe that this
	<b>Psittacula</b> was felt to be <b>Psittacula</b> Illiger 1811 (how
	is this known?).</li> 
	<li>1848 Cabanis described a South American (eastern Venezuela)
	parrot as <i>Psittacula modesta</i>, and evidently there is some
	belief that the <b>Psittacula</b> that Cabanis had in mind was
	<b>Psittacula</b> Cuvier, (how is this known?).</li> 
	<li>1859 Gray described <i>Psittacula sclateri</i> for a 
	parrot from Rio Javari, Peru.</li> 
	<li>Peters held that <i>Psittacula modesta</i> Cabanis was
	pre-occupied by <i>Psittacula modesta</i> (Fraser). and erected
	<i>Forpus slateri eidos</i> as a new name for <i>Psittacula
	modesta</i> Cabanis. He supported this decision with Hellmayr's
	discussion of the character and distribution of the races of
	<i>Forpus sclateri</i> Hellmayr. 1910. Novit.Zool.
