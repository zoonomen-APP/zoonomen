Mulleripicus funebris parkesi <strong>Nomenclature (date)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This taxon is dated variably to 1957 or 1958.</li>
	<li>Birds of the World (accessed 2021.11.27) for example dates it to 1957 (the imprint and

<hr><A id="H.parensisCite"></a>
Hylopezus paraensis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The date for this taxon presents a problem.</li>
	<li>It is described here:	<a href="https://ia800309.us.archive.org/BookReader/BookReaderImages.php?id=ornithologisch181910berl&itemPath=%2F14%2Fitems%2Fornithologisch181910berl&server=ia800309.us.archive.org&page=n205_w420" target="new">Orn.Montasb. <b>18</b>:192</a></li>
			<li>At the bottom of the page, reference is made to a Danzig publication from 2011</li>
			<li>That work is seen here: <a href="https://www.archive.org/download/berichtdeswestp331911west/page/n2_w373" target="new">33. Bericht.WestPr.Botan.-Zool.Vereins</a></li>
			<li>On the first page of the article referred to in Orn.Monatsb. is a reference to the lecture
		      	on the subject given in 1910, and it would have probably been known that
		the material would be published in the proceedings of the 33 General Meeting. That is seen here: 
		<a href="https://www.archive.org/download/berichtdeswestp331911west/page/n189_w370" 
     target="new"> Bericht.WestPr.BOtan.-Zool.Vereins p.158</a></li>
			<li>The note at bottom translates:<pre>Lecture given at the 33rd General Meeting of the Society in Briesen on May 18. 1910.</li></pre>
		<li>Orn.Monatsb. is extraordinary (for this period) in being dependably timely. When the publication date
			differs from the imprint date it usually is a publication date that <b>preceeds</b> the imprint date (or
			part of the imprint date for the bimonthly issues).</li>
		<li>Charles W. Richmond lists the publication date as 1910, and the evidence indicates that he himself 
			looked at this page that included the reference to the 1911 publication. I interpret this
			to be the case, because the copy in the BHL is the Smithsonian Copy, and it has little "+" marks
			next to taxa.  This procedure was typical of (but not unique to) Richmond.  Richmond was unusually adept
			at recognizing indicia of delayed publications, so it would be surprising if he missed this one. Surprising, 
			but possible.</li>
		<li>On balance I will leave the date as 1910, but with some trepidation, and concern that I am not being entirely
			consistent with my practice in similar situations.  I may be putting too much emphasis on the apparent 
			regularity of the publishing history for this serial, and on the very low error rate in Richmond's work.</li>

<hr><A id="M.prawiradilagaeCite"></a>
Myzomela prawiradilagae <strong>Citation date</strong>
<ul>
	<li>A confusing, and in my view an unfortunate situation here</li>
	<li>The portion of the hard copy published J.Orn. containing this new
		description is in the January 2020 issue.</li>
	<li>However, there is a copy of the material online dated 5 Oct. 2019, and a note
		in the hard copy indicating it was "Published 05 October 2019".</li>
	<li>The online copy ("Published" in 2019) is unpaginated.</li>
	<li>Thus, we end up with an unusual citation discordant between the online version
		and the print version.  The citation MUST be to the online version.</li>
	<li>I am unclear whether it is appropriate to include the "number" (as is conventionally done).</li>
	<li>It appears to me this is similar to author's preprints that were frequently issued in the
		19th and early 20th centuries.  These often had different pagination from the
		copy included in the final published volume, and the taxa involved <b>must</b> be cited
		to the author's preprints.</li>
	<li>The lack of pagination, no doubt seems a triviality to most, but I see it as a serious
		deficiency, and hold myself back from expressing the very strong critical feelings I have
		on the matter.</li>
	<li>The note on the website further limits the authors of the taxon to the "(first, second and last of 7)".</li>

Phasianus cholchicus principalis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>II</b>:122 to "p.322 pl.32"</li>
	<li>The correct page and plate citation is p.324 and pl.22, as

<hr><A name="R.pennataNomen." id="R.pennataNomen."></a>
Rhea pennata <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>

	<li>This name is cited to 1834 (Peters CL <b>I</b>:7) and Hellmayr &amp; Conover <b>1</b>(1):6. 
		Salvadori (CBBM <b>27</b>:582 gives the date "1835-1838".
		These all refer to the second volume (<i>Itineraire</i>) of the Voy.Am.merid.</li>
	<li>Note, that this same volume is cited to "<i>ca.</i> 1839" by Peters (Peters <b>III</b>:200 for <i>Arara aymara</i> (also pubished in volume 2 of the <i>Itineraire</i>).
		Cory (Cat.B.Am. <b>II</b>(1):73 cites the parrot to 1839.  H&amp;M 4<sup>th</sup> <b>I</b>:357 cites this name to 1839, though Orbigny's <i>Arara aymara</i> is not discussed by Dickinson &amp; Leboss&eacute; (at least not that I find).</li>
	<li>The work by Dickinson &amp; Leboss&eacute; (Zoological Bibliography <b>V</b>(1-5) 2017-2018) does not deal
		the parrot name or the rhea name; it appears they chose not to investigate the dates of the <i>Itineraire</i> (ZB 2017 <b>5</b>(1):4)
		even though one and possibly two new taxa are described therein.</li>
	<li>Dickinson and Leboss&eacute;'s work make it clear that this work (Voy.Am.merid.) overall had mulitple and complex publication delays.</li>
	<li>	I speculate that these delays
	       	may explain why Orbigny included a note in the April 1837 issue of L'Echo du Monde Savant claiming his authority for this name.  
		It appears he was concerned that a publication by Gould might threaten the priority of his authorship, and indeed later that year (Nov. 21) Gould
		published a description of the bird with the name <i>Rhea darwinii</i> (PZS <b>V</b> no.li:35)</li>
	<li>Sherborn cites the 1837 Echo du Monde Savant for the name <i>Rhea pennata</i>.</li>
	<li>It appears that as brief as the note is, the 1837 Echo du Monde Savant citation is the authority for the name, unless it is shown
		that the volume 2 <i>Itineraire</i> was published before 1837.  If so this in turn would then require a different 
		date for the parrot name.</li>
	<li>This vexed matter was addressed by Salvadori in CBBM <b>XVII</b>:583 where his note indicates that Des Murs held that Orbigny named
		the bird in 1830 in his correspondence with Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire.  The 1837 vol.1 (n.s.) of Charlesworth's Magazine of
		Natural Hist. (p.504) refers to a letter in which Orbigny claims priority for the name.  The letter was published in "one of the French
		scientific journals", but one that Salvadori was not able to find.</li>

<hr><A name="H.picaoidesNomen" id="H.picaoidesNomen"></a>
Heterophasia picaoides <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Conventionally given as <i>pi<strong>c</strong>aeoides</i>.</li> 
	<li>Modern authors appear to be following Cat.B.Br.Mus. <strong>7</strong>:401 (Sharpe 1883), 
	or Peters CL <strong>X</strong>:420 (Deignan 1964).</li>
	<li>As noted by both of these sources, the original spelling is <i>Pi<strong><u>e</u></strong>aoides</i>.
	<li>Sharpe may be basing his spelling on the unpublished plate that is in the collection
	of the Br. Mus.</li>
	<li>However, in the cited and published source for the name, not only does the spelling
	employ the <strong>e</strong> rather than the <strong>c</strong>, but also the text immediately
	following the name states: "Pie-like". This can be seen here:
	<a href="http://www.zoonomen.net/avtax/n/image/JASB_8_38.jpg" 
	target="new"><i>J.Asiat.Soc.Bengal</i> 8 p.38</a></li>
	<li>What Hodgson means by "Pie-like" is not made more explicit. My guess is that it means Pie, as in Magpie,
	which, of course, is why <i>pica...</i> also seems so appropriate.</li>
	<li>It appears <b>unlikely</b> that "Pie-like" is a misprint for "Pic-like, which would seem unlikely as an expression in English.</li>
	<li>My interpretation is that <i>picaoides</i> is an unjustified emendation. 
	Hodgson's spelling and specific intent are explicit in the original publication.</li>
	<li>The spelling <i>pi<strong>c</strong>aeoides</i> may be acceptible if it is present on the plate, and
	the plate is demonstrated to satisfy publication requirements. However, even in this case, Hodgson's published
       	text "Pie-like" seems compelling, and would implies accepting the inference of "pica" for (mag)pie as a basis for the "pica..." spelling.</li>
	<li>In The Zoological Miscellany G.R. Gray lists the names on plates and drawings in the Cat.Nip.Birds, and on p.83 has both "T. ? picaoides, 363" and also
	a name "Alcopus (Sibia) picaoides, 246" so it seems the "c" spelling was used on the plates.</li>
	<li>"pie" was a commonly used name for the magpie in the 18th and 19th
	centuries. See for example "The Life of Thomas Nuttall" 1967. J.E. Graustein
	Harvard Univ. Press (p.6) where she quotes Nuttall writing about the magpie:<p>
	"As might have been anticiapted from his sagacity, the Pie hs been 
	considered as a messenger of fate in the north of Europe..."<p>.
	So when Hodgson said "Pie-like", it seems reasonable to interpret that he meant
	"Pie-like" and <b>NOT</b> "Pica-like", and that this was then represented as "pieaoides".  This best argument for a different intention (to my mind) is the "a" in 
	the name.</li>
	<li>There is a long tradition of persons feeling they can recognize
	error, when something does not match their expectation.  The Code allows
	correction of obvious errors, but why this is in fact an <b>obvious</b> error is not
	clear to me.</li>
	2020.04.06
	<li> I am (at long last) convinced by countervailing arguments.
		The Latinization of "pie" would PROBABLY be "pic" <strong>and</strong> the most parsimonious explanation
		for this unusual published spelling would be a <i>lapsus</i> by the type setter looking at the text
		and picking up a bit of "e" type, while Hodgson almost certainly would have written "c".</li>
	<li>My strong (perhaps overly strong) preference for original spellings leaves me a bit unsatisfied here.
		I feel I am uncomfortable dealing with things as they actually happened, rather than rushing about
		re-writing history so that if fits my expectations.</li>
	<li>In ornithological nomenclature this name pops out for the unusual spelling, and thus gets lots of attention.
		In non-ornithological nomenclature the number of unusual appearing names is substantial, and trying to investigate
		which should be forced to comply with one's expectations seems a silly and bootless task.</li>

		(See: http://www.archive.org/stream/monographTrochi4Goul#page/n241/mode/2upa)</li>
	<li>At the base of the page of text Gould writes: <pre>By some inadvertence the term <i>Heliomaster</i> has been printed on the Plate <i>Helioster</i>.</pre>.</li> 
		<li>I do not find this name in the PZS in Pts 19-21.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>My interpretation is that Gould may well have had "Helioster" on the <b>drawing</b> while the <b>plate</b> had "Heliomaster".</li>
	<li>"Helioster" was never <strong>published</strong> as a name, though Gould may have intended it to be.</li>
	<li>If in fact a plate (or text) was published with the name as "<i>Helioster pinicola</i>" and that name were shown to have priority, the matter might be more difficult.</li>

Selenidera piperivora <strong>Nomenclature  </strong>

	<li>[2010.06.08] Previously as <i>Selenidera culik</i> with this discussion.</li>
	<ul>
<li>I have some difficulty making sense of this citation.
I follow Peters Checklist <b>6</b>:79, and do not find an entry for this in the Richmond
Index.</li>
<li>The orthography of the Sherborn entry is a confusion. It reads:<pre>
"<b>culik</b> Pteroglossus, J. Wagler, Syst. Avium, I. 1827, sign. I<sub>11</sub>."</pre>
The subscripted "11" tempts me to interpret it as the species number, however 
the citation for <i>Selenidera reinwardtii</i> is similarly:<pre>
"<b>reinwardtii</b> Pteroglossus, J. Wagler, Syst. Avium, I. 1827, sign. I<sub>11</sub>."</pre>
Surprisingly, the Sherborn listing for <i>Campethera punctuligera</i> is : <pre>
"<b>punctuligera</b> Picus, J. Wagler, Syst. Avium, I. 1827, sign.  <b>2</b><sub>11</sub>."</pre>(bolding supplied)
The Richmond Index list this as "[p.27]".<br>
The Sherborn listing for <i>Pteroglossus Humbloti</i> is:<pre>
"<b>humbloti</b> Pteroglossus, J. Wagler, Syst. Avium, I. 1827, sign I<sub>9</sub>".</pre>
The Richmond Index lists this as "[p.9]" so in this instance the p.no and sp.no appear to match.

So I remain confused.</li>

identifiable" (by Peters and others), but that the 1766 Linnean entry was adequate. The 1766 Linnean
name has additionally been used by multiple authors (from 1907 to 2004) and they 
felt it must be considered the valid name for this taxon. They would give the citation as:<ul>

<li>Selenidera piperivora (<a href="../../bio/biol.html#Linnaeus"
target="ref_fr">Linnaeus</a>) 1766 <i><a href="../../cit/jours.html#Syst.Nat."
target="ref_fr">Syst.Nat.ed.12</a></i> p.150 <a href="./p.html#S.piperivoraNomen"
target="ref_fr">Nomenclature</a></li>
</ul>

<li>However, as noted by Murray Bruce (<i>in litt.</i> 2006.10.19) 
their points do not change the fact that the (adequately described) Linnaeus 1766 name is 
preoccupied by the (unidentifiable) Linnaeus 1758 name. Thus it would seem that 
<i>culik</i> must stand</li>

<li>Whitney &amp; Pacheco 2006 do not reference (and may not have seen) 
an important work in which Peters addresses this matter. I am thankful to Murray Bruce for bringing it to my attention. It is:

	target="ref_fr">Hartlaub</a> 1887 <i><a
	href="../../cit/jourz.html#Zool.Jahrb."
	target="ref_fr">Zool.Jahrb.</a></i> 2 p.343</li></ul>
<li>Originally I had this as <ul>

<li>Ploceus pelzelni (<a href="../../bio/bioh.html#Hartlaub"

href="../../cit/jourz.html#Zool.Jahrb."
target="ref_fr">Zool.Jahrb.</a></i> 2 Heft2 p.343 pl.14 fig.9,10</li></ul>

<li>However, at least 4 months prior to Hartlaub's publication in Zool.Jarhb. (May 1887)
Shelley published this name in Ibis (Jan. 1887 p.23) with the following text:<pre>
Dr. Hartlaub informs me by letter that his <i>Hyphantornis crocata</i> 
is totally distinct from the <i>Icteropsis crocata</i>, Pelz.,
for which latter species he has therefore suggested the name
of <i>Sitagra pelzelni.</i></pre></li>
<li>Pelzeln erected the genus <b>Icteropsis</b> in 1881 in Verh.k.k.Zool.-Bot.Ges.Wien 
<b>31</b>:149 where Hartlaub's <i>Hyphantornis crocata</i> (with a Latin diagnosis apparently
by Pelzeln) is the type by monotypy.</i><ol>

</ol></li>
<li>It appears to me that by indication Shelley's publication satisfies the relevant provisions
of Articles 10 and 11 of the Code, and despite his intentions, Shelley is the author of the 
name.</li>
<li>Hartlaub's <i>Hyphantornis crocata</i> has the diagnosis reproduced in J.Orn. <b>30</b>:451,
where it cites the original in Abh.Naturw.Ver.Bremen <b>VII</b> Band 2. Heft 1881 p.100 - 
the citation given for <i>Ploceus crocata</i>.</li>
<li>It does not seem correct to me to cite this name to 1887 Zool.Jahrb. when the name
was used earlier and linked, by indication, with <i>Icteropsis crocata</i>, whatever the
status of that name may be.</li>
<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:270 (through Corrigenda 8) gives Hartlaub as the author of the name, without comment.</li>

Troglodytes aedon parkmanii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>This bird was named for the famous and wealthy Boston physician, 
	George Parkman (1790-1849). Parkman was the victim of one of the most famous murders
	of the 19th century. His fellow Harvard faculty member John Webster (1793-1850) 
	was convicted and executed for the 1849 murder. 
	The case was sensational, controversial, and with repercussions that
	last in the law to this day.<br>
	This case is credited with establishing the requirement of proof beyond a
	reasonable doubt, as opposed to "an absolute certainty" (at the time the standard
	in a murder trial). Other important precedents were set in this trial as well, and
	the witnesses included historical figures including Oliver Wendall Holmes, Sr., 
	William T.G. Morton (famous for introducing the use of ether for anesthesia).<br>
	Simon Schama published a history of the affair (1991), and a PBS documentary 
	was produced on the subject. While Chief Justice Shaw is noted and quoted for his
	instructions to the jury in the case, that at that time "real time"  stenographic
	recordings of trials did not exist. Shaw's "instructions", as delivered from 
	the bench, were felt by the reporters present to be garbled and confusing.
	Shaw seems to have responded by writing down what he felt the instructions were,
	and these seem to be clear and direct, so it is speculated that his "instuctions"
	were probably not those that he actually delivered in court. 
	That, at least, is a speculation.

Stiphrornis pyrrholaemus <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>On p.29 of this publication, the name is given as <pre>
	<b><i>Stiphrornis pyrrholaemus</i> sp. nov. (Schmidt &amp; Angehr)</b></pre>
	which implies (to me at least) that Schmidt and Angehr see themselves as the author of the taxon.
	It is interesting that their names are given in parentheses, which are reserved in the Code
	for indicating that a "species group name is combined with a generic name other than the original one"
	(Art. 51.3), and that surely is not the case here.<p>
	Regarding authority the Code reads<pre>
If a work is by more than one person but it is clear from the contents that 
only one of these is responsible for the name or act, then that person is the author; 
otherwise the author of the work is deemed to be the author of the name or act.</pre>
	This statement has obvious logical deficiencies, but lets see if I can apply what I interpret to
	be the intent of this portion to this problem.</li>
	<li>My guess would be that if the <b>content of this work</b> (whatever else the authors may subsequently
	say is immaterial) makes it clear that <b>only</b> Schmidt and Angher were responsible "for the name or act"
	then they would be deemed to be the authors of the name.</li>
	<li>The first sentance of the abstract reads: <pre>
	We describe a new species of forest robin from ...</pre>
	This seems to create a problem, as the "we" seemingly <b>must</b> refer to the authors (all of them) of the paper.
	If there was a note in the text, or a footnote on the name that said something like "Schmidt and Angehr alone
	are responsible for naming this taxon" then the case would be clear -- to me at least.</li>
	<li>Probably it is reasonable to interpret the text on p.29 as "making it clear" that Schmidt and Angehr alone
	were responsible for <b>naming</b> this taxon, but it is also reasonable to state that a few words to that effect
	would have demonstrated awareness of the applicable Code as well as eliminating any uncertainty.</li>
	<li>I do not see it as entirely unreasonable to interpret the authors of the work as the authors of the name.</li>

Ptyonoprogne obsoleta pallida <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:536 places the authority for this name in parentheses with
	no comment, though this departs from Peters Checklist <b>9</b>:103 (= Mayr &amp; Greenway 1960).
	HBW <b>9</b>:673 (= Turner,AK 2004) holds the taxon as <i>Ptyonoprogne fuligula pallida</i> and
	does <b>not</b> place the authority in parenthese. In my view this latter approach is correct.</li>
	<li>It appears, both from the Richmond Index and from the Peters CL rendering, that Hume's original 
	combination was as <i>Ptionoprogne Pallida</i>. So the question becomes: was there a proposed
	genus group name <b>Ptionoprogne</b> published prior to Humes use of the name, or was it simply
	an emendation of Reichenbach's <b>Ptyonoprogne</b>?.<p>
	The Richmond Index indicates two uses of <b>Ptionoprogne</b>: <ol>
		<li>Stoliczka used this name in the June issue of J.Asiat.Soc.Bengal <b>XLI</b> Pt2 no.2 p.219,231,
		though Richmond comments "[pro <u>Ptyonoprogne</u> Rchb. 1850]" -- indicating it was
		an emendation.</li>
	       
		<li>Blanford proposed (or used) a genus group name <b>Ptionoprogne</b>
		which Geibel quotes as "Ibis 1863 III 214".</li>
	</ol><p>This second instance might require the use of parentheses for
	the current representation as <i>Ptyonoprogne obsoleta pallida</i>. However, Richmond indicates that Blanford's
	name was actually published in 1873, which would post-date Hume's use, thus supporting the interpretation that
	Hume's use was  an emendation. In that case compliance with the Code (1999) would require that parentheses 
	<b>not</b> be used for the authority.</li>

Periparus ater pekinensis <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:94 (= Snow 1967) cites this name to<pre>
		David 1870 Ibis, p.155</pre> which most probably simply parrots the 
	entry in the CBBM <b>8</b>:41. Other authors (H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:526; 
	HBW <b>12</b>:722) in turn appear to parrot the Peters entry.</li>
	<li>It appears to me that this name was first published in 1868 by J. Verreaux as cited.
	(data from the Richmond Index). That taxon is linked to material that is (or was) in
	the Paris Museum. Whether that material can be now identified with certainty is 
	not known to me.</li>
	<li>As there is a published indication (the Richmond Index) that the 
	first use of the name is due to Verreaux 1868, the burden of 
	proof lies upon those who support the use of a later publication (1870) by a 
	different author (David).</li>
	<li>(2009.08.16) Colin Jones supplied me with the URL to examine this work, 
	the article commences:<pre>

	un certain nombre d'Oiseaux, parmi lesquels nous avons remarqu&eacute; les 
	suivants comme constituant des esp&egrave;ces nouvelles pour la science :</pre></li>
	<li>The name is given, followed by "A. David" but there are no quotes around
	the desription, or any indication that David supplied anything other than the specimen
	and (apparently) the manuscript name.</li>
	<li>I continue to interpret this matter such that the author of the name is Verreaux, and
	the date cited should be 1868, though it must be stressed that this contrasts with
	Peters, HBW <b>12</b>:722; &amp;

to Schalow in J.Orn. <b>23</b> 1875. This is found in no.130, the

slowly emerging was probably delayed for a minimum of 3-8 months before
it actually appeared.</li>
<li>In Schalow's J.Orn. use of the name he attributes it to Severtzov in
1873, also in the J.Orn. where Severtzov uses the name <i>Lanio
phoenicuroides</i> p.347 in a list, where it appears to be a <i>nomen
nudum</i>.</li>
<li>Severtzov also published the name <i>L[anius] phaeicuroides</i> in the
Nov. 1875 number of Stray Feathers <b>III</b> no.5 p.429. My
interpretation of the Richmond Index card in this case is that Severtzov
was using <i>L. phaenicuroides</i> for <i>L. phaenicuris</i> (described
in that work at p.144). So the Schalow use of the name may very will be
the first valid instance of use. If not, the date could be a problem as

<li>I can not resolve the uncertainty regarding the affinities of this subspecies, or
the species level status of <i>moniliger</i>, but I can correct the nomenclatural
errors. The Richmond Index demonstrates that the

has included notes indicating that <ol>

	<li>"in some copies [it is] corrected by a a slip pasted over the name, reading
	"<u>Formicarius</u> <u>pallidus</u>"</li>
	</ol> </li>

<li>The Code's discussion of such situations is as follows:<pre>
32.5. <b>Spellings that must be corrected (incorrect original spellings).</b>

	32.5.1. If there is in the original publication itself, without recourse to any
	external source of information, clear evidence of an inadvertent error, such as a
	lapsus calami or a copyist's or printer's error, it must be corrected. Incorrect
	transliteration or latinization, or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel, are
	not to be considered inadvertent errors.

		32.5.1.1. The correction of a spelling of a name in a publisher's or
		author's corrigendum issued simultaneously with the original work or as a
		circulated slip to be inserted in the work (or if in a journal, or work
		issued in parts, in one of the parts of the same volume) is to be accepted as
		clear evidence of an inadvertent error.</pre>

<A id="S.c.plumbicepsNomen" name="S.c.plumbicepsNomen"></a>
Saltator coerulescens plumbiceps <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several issues here	</li>
	<li>The original spelling appears to be <i>plumbiceps</i>, based on the Richmond Index.</li>
	<li>Gadow in CBBM <b>11</b>:289 (1886) emends this without comment 
		to <i>plumb<big><b>e</b></big>iceps</i>; Lawrence is listed as the author.</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small>:824 (through Corrigenda 6) also lists the author
		as Lawrence (but with the correct spelling for the species epithet).</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index lists the author as "Baird in Lawrence", which I follow until this is shown
		to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Examination of a copy of the original description (kindly provided by Craig Ludwig and Roy McDiarmid of the Smithsonian)
clarified many issues. The spelling is clearly as indicated by Richmond in the Richmond Index and the author of the taxon is
Baird and not Lawrence.</li>

<li>Most workers attribute this name to Lawrence (<i>e.g.</i> Sclater CBBM
<b>11</b>:289; Deignan USNM Bull. 221:591;
H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:824; and this
interpretation is understandable when it is based on either a casual and
partial review of the original description, or more commonly when the
attribution simply results from uncritically reproducing the work of
others (as I did until looking into this matter in more detail).</li>
<li>The name is usually listed as a "Baird MS" name except in the case of
the Richmond Index where the name is 
listed as <pre>Baird in G. N. Lawrence</pre> so the question arises: what
are the facts of the matter?</li>
<li>First, Lawrence's note at the end of the article (p.482) must be heeded, 
it reads:
<pre>  <i>Note.</i>&#8212; I recently found in certain families of birds in the
collection of the Smith. Institution, several new species, and 
among others some with MS. names given by Prof. Baird,
which I have adopted; these are the five last described in the
above paper. Prof. Baird kindly furnished me with his notes,
made a few years since when he received the birds, with his
permission to use them and to make such alterations as I
might deem necessary; <b>his notes are indicated by quotation 
marks</b>.</pre> (emphasis supplied).</li>

The description that preceeds this is (p.477):<pre>
	<big><b>15. Saltator plumbiceps,</b> Baird, MS.</big>

  <b>"</b>Male. Upper plumage grayish olive, the head above and at the
sides cinereous; tail olivaceous; quills dark biown edged with ashy gray; beneath
whitish, tinged with gray or brownish gray on jugulum and breast, passing behind on
the remaining under parts into pale fulvous, of which color also are the axillaries;
superciliary line reaching to the nape, bend of the wing and broad throat stripe
white, the latter margined with a black line and above this a light gray one; irides
reddish; bill and feet dark brown.

  <b>"</b>Length 8 in.; wing 4.; tail 3.75; bill from nostrils .56, commissure .90;
tarsus 1.06.

  <b>"</b><i>Habitat.</i>&#8212; Mazatlan. Collected by J. Xantus, 1863. No. of type,
29,372.
  <b>"</b>This species, as far as I can ascertain, is undescribed, and is interesting
as being the most northern representative of the genus yet discovered. It approaches
the <i>Saltator rufiventris</i> of Vigors (<i>S. vigorsii</i> of Gray, and, perhaps,
of Bonaparte, Notes Ornith. 23), and considered perhaps justly to be a synonym of
<i>S. grandis</i>, but appears to be lighter below, the abdomen and crissum by no
means rufous, and the super ciliary stripe extending far beyond the eye; it resembles
typical specimen of <i>qrandis</i> in the absence of clear olivaceous on the back and
wings; it is, however, much paler beneath,
the head lighter, the black stripe bordering the throat narrow, and with a light line
above it; although the wings are longer, the bill is smaller, narrower, and much less
tumid.<b>"</b>
  <i>Remarks.</i>&#8212; In the color of the back this species is much like <i>S.
grandis</i>, but is of a lighter olive, the latter species has the sides of the head
brownish black, the black border to the throat much wider, and the under surface very
much darker; the new species in its under plumage resembles somewhat <i>S.
olivaciens</i>, hut the colors are paler, less cinereous, and the tinge of fulvous
more diffused.</pre></li>
<li>It is noted that only the "Remarks" section is not enclosed in quotes, and this
section must be attributed to Lawrence.</li>

<li>Article 50.1.1 of the Code (1999) reads:<pre>
<b>50.1.1.</b> However, if it is clear from the contents that some person other than an
author of the work is alone responsible both for the name or act and for satisfying the
criteria of availability other than actual publication, then that other person is the
author of the name or act. If the identity of that other person is not explicit in the
work itself, then the author is deemed to be the person who publishes the work.</pre>
I hold that given the details of this matter and given Art. 50.1.1 that Baird is the
author here.</li>

Piranga <strong>Nomenclature</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>13</b> (=Storer, 1970) lists the authority in parentheses when taxa were described in <b>Pyranga</b>

<li>This is followed, without comment,  by H&amp;M 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small>:818 (through Corrigenda 6).</li>
<li>The published literature (Neave, 1940 p.1057 &amp; The Richmond Index) makes it clear that <b>Pyranga</b> Vieillot, 1817
is merely an emendation of <b>Piranga</b> Vieillot, 1808.</li>
<li>Therefore, if the published literature and the ICZN Code (1999) is to be followed, the authority should not be in
parentheses.</li> 
<li>This problem has been addressed repeatedly and  previously, but these <b>published</b> interpretations are apparently
neglected ; The AOU CL 7<sup>th</sup> lists all taxa currently
held in <b>Piranga</b> but described in <b>Pyranga</b> without parentheses for the authority (<i>viz</i>: <i>P. roseogularis,

Aramadis cajanea plumbeicollis <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mark Brown has brought to my attention some confusion and uncertainty regrading this citation.</li>
<li>This taxon is often cited (<i>e.g.</i> Peters Checklist <b>2</b>:175 lists this citation to volume "2" of
"An. Mus. Nac. Costa Rica", and has a footnote indicating that the name is a <i>nomen nudum</i> in "An.Mus.Nac.Costa
Rica, <b>1</b>, 1887, p.131."</li>
<li>The Handbook of Learned Societies and Institutes of Americas by the Carnegie Institute suggests two possibilities
there is uncertainty about whether the description was published in volume 1 or 2. If published in volume 2 the date of
publication may well be 1889.</li>
<li>The Richmond Index (which has the highest <b>probability</b> of being correct) does not list a volume number, but
lists the taxon to p.3 and 1888. This would fit with the scenario (which appears most likely to me) that there was
<b>no</b> volume "2" of the An.Mus.Nac.CostaRica -- which was continued as the "Anales del Instituto Fisico-Geografico
y del Museo Nacional de Costa Rica".</li>
<li>For now I follow the citation as shown in the Richmond Index.</li>
<li>Thanks again to Mark Brown for bringing this interesting bit of confusion to my attention.</li>
<li>Further (and better) understanding comes via Frederick Brammer (<i>in. litt.</i> 2020.12.23) who
directs my attention to  Marcondes,Rafael Sobral; Silveira,Luís F&aacute;bio (2015): A taxonomic review of Aramides cajaneus (Aves, Gruiformes, Rallidae) 
with notes on morphological variation in other species of the genus. Zookeys <b>500</b>:111-140.<li>
	<li>They present the publishing history and demonstrate that volume 2, as previously cited, was never in fact published
		which obviates its use as an indication for the 1888 name use, which now must be held as a <i>nomen nudem</i>.

<ul>
<li>Conventionally cited to 1794 (<i>e.g.</i> Peters Checklist <b>10</b>:231 (Deignan, 1964)).</li>
<li>The Richmond Index card for this taxon has "1794" with the "4" crossed out and "5" written over
it. The basis for this change is not completely clear, but there are apparent problems with the
"1794" date. Mathews in Biliography of the Birds of Australia p.124 notes that pt. III was received
at the Linnean Society (Lond.) on Feb. 4th, 1794, but on the line below notes that the G&ouml;tt
Journ., Vol. I, heft 2, p.143 notes the date of 1795 for pt. III.</li>
<li>The internal inconsistency of Mathews' dates seems typical to me. His statement that pt. III was
received Feb. 4th, 1794 seems particularly problematic as apparently pll.  IX, X of this part bear
the date "10/9/94". It is possible that Mathews intended to say the material was received Feb. 4th
179<b><big>5</big></b>.</li>

<li>Very little of that make sense, certainly there is no "volume 52" that occurs during this period,
and the only part of the "1884" volume that was published in 1885 was Pt.4 pp.475-645.</li>
<li>As there were other taxa attributable to Berlepsch &amp; Taczanowski close to this page number (pp.296,299)

Heliodoxa leadbeateri parvula <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>5</b>:88 cites this taxon to 1887, which is the imprint date for this
number (No.179) of the J.Orn. This date is followed by most workers (<i>e.g.</i>H&amp;M
3<small><sup>rd</sup></small>:269; HBW <b>5</b>:615).</li>
<li>The Richmond Index notes that this number of the J.Orn. was "Issued in Nov. or later!" and
references Ibis 1891 p.616, where Sclater indicates that Waterhouse has furnished him with the dates
at which parts of the J.Orn. were received at the Library of the Zoological Society of London. This
number was received March 5, 1888, which appears to be the first date at which this number can be
proven to be available.</li><br>
2014.04.04<br>
<li>Given the information above, the date "1887" is simply not compliant with the rules of the Code. 
With November information in the "Juli" Heft, that date specified in the work can be characterized 
as being found to be incorrect. The Code then requires that the earliest day on which the work is 
demonstrated to be in existence as a published work is to be adopted. The data above would suggest March 5, 1888.</li>
<li>However, at least part of this work was published as an author's separate, or author's edition.
A copy of that separate is found in Ridgway's material and includes notations by Richmond. The cover wrapper
includes the date "Januar" and the hand written note on the wrapper indicates that it was "Rec'd Jan. 30, 1888" (a Monday).
(Absent the specification as to day the work would need to have been dated Jan. 31, 1888.)</li>  
<li>A date of 1887 remains <strong>possible</strong> but would require specific data
demonstrating the Juli Heft as being available as a published work <strong>in</strong> 1887. I know
of no such data or evidence, and given the publishing history of this serial, expect that it is unlikely.
Absent such a demonstration, 1888 is the correct date. Furhtermore, the citation must be to the (repaginated) 
author's edition, demonstrated to be in existence more than a month before the Heft was received at the Zoological
Society.</li>

The Richmond Index lists this as:<pre>

	<li>Sclater in Syst.Av.Ethiop. <b>1</b>:30 attributes the name to Hartlaub, and adding

	<li>Sharpe in his Hand-list <b>1</b>:202 attributes the authority to Verreaux with a note

<li>The name in Des Murs' work, is attributed to Lafresnaye, and the descriptive

that Lafresnaye's text is being used. Therefore, my interpretation is that the
author of the name is Lafresnaye (or more formally Lafresnaye in Des Murs).</li>

<li>The spelling is <i>pucherani</i> on the plate, and <i>pucheranii</i> in the
text, additionally Lafresnaye uses the spelling <i>pucheranii</i> in his 1850
Rev.Mag.Zool. article.</li>

<li>Therefore, I attribute the authority to Lafresnaye, rather than Des Murs, and
the spelling as <i>pucheranii</i>.</li>

<li>[2010.01.20] David, Dickinson, &amp; Gregory. 2009. "Contributons to a List

this volume when there are two dates, the date in parentheses is the
date of publication; the unparenthesized date is the imprint date).</li>

Treron psittaceus <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>This taxon would appear to be the result of less than complete reseach by Salvadori 
when he prepared the Columbiformes volume of the Cat.B.Br.Mus.  Salvadori cites Temminck & Knip 
as the authors of this taxon, and this appears to be followed without question or comment by 
Peters <b>III</b>:17 and HBW <b>4</b>:198.</li>

<li>No mention is made of <ul>

	<li>[Columba] psittacea <a href="../../bio/biof.html#Forster,JR" 
	target="ref_fr">Forster,JR</a> 1795 <i><a 
	href="../../cit/jourf.html#FaunulaIndica.ed.2" target="ref_fr">FaunulaIndica.ed.2</a></i> 
	p.10</li>
	</ul>
Though certainly other currently valid taxa are cited to this source.</li>

<li>The Forster name, would create problems of its own because, at least according to the Richmond
Index it is a synonym of <i>Columba vernans</i> Linnaeus 1771 (now <i>Treron vernans</i>). 
So it appears that the currently used name is a junior primary homonym of a name that is itself a 
synonym of a taxon now in the same genus (!).</li>

<li>To the extent I have been able to determine, the senior homonym (<i>Columba psittacea</i>) is
likely a <i>nomen oblitum</i> unused since 1899. If this name has been used since 1899,
I understand from Edward Dickinson that the most likely place for it to have occured would be
in the works of Oberholser in his treatment of the Abbott collections from the East Indies. 
I have not had the opportunity to see if the name is in fact used there, but probably this
should be pursued, as Oberholser undoubtedly used the Richmond Index, where this Forster name is 
included. Therefore Oberholser could have easily known of the name.</li>

<li>Cited by Peters Checklist <b>8</b>:207 (Traylor, 1979) and by Wolters
(p.183) as published in 1826; these are either typographic errors or remarkable

<li>Nevertheless, this date ("1826") is followed without comment or question by
H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:374 as well as by HBW <b>9</b>:408 (? J.A. Mobely).</li>

<li>What this tells us is that none of these authors consulted The Richmond
Index, Neave, Schulze, or such obscure references as the 3<sup>rd</sup>,
4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> AOU
Checklists where 1827 is the date cited.</li>

<li><b>Nilaus</b> from some three pages earlier in the same volume of the

date of 1828 (!). Similarly, Wolters (p.230) cites 1827 for <b>Nilaus</b>.</li>

<li>CW Richmond's unpublished notes on Dates of Publication indicates that the
table of contents of the Journal has Vol. III no. X for "April-September, 1827".
Furthermore, Richmond notes that the Trans. of the Linn. Soc. of London quotes
no.6-10 for the Zool.Journ. as "1825-1827", which would certainly put this
number in 1827. Thus it appears that neither Traylor nor Wolters examined
the original serial or sought any corroborative information regarding the
date</li>

<li>Subsequent workers, are clearly ready to accept Peters Checklist without
question, or without consideration of sources such as the AOU Checklists.</li>

  The peculiar structure of the feet in this bird, so different

<li>To date, I am unable to find any indication that <b>Megal&aelig;ma</b> was

and do not use parentheses around the author's name. Sherborn lists
<b>Megalaema</b> (without ligature) as an Agassiz "<i>emend. pro</i> Megalaima,
Gray.", and Schulze "Nomen. animalium gen. et subgen." p.1995 also has this

<li>Peters <b>8</b>:312 [= Mayr] is the source of 1863 for <i>Anthocincla

<i>Gecinulus viridis</i> to 1862.</li>

<li>CWR has notes on these taxa, listing both in 1862 in vol.31 with a
handwritten notes indicating "no.3 [not <u>ante</u> June]" (<i>A. Phayrei</i>)
and "no.3 not earlier than June" (<i>G. viridis</i>).</li>

<li>This JASB is such an unresolved nightmare, that I am willing to believe
almost anything is possible. But especially as these two taxa occur in the same
number (no.3) of this volume, I would think they should both have the same year
date (until some story helps us understand otherwise). It appears from CWR's
note, and from Mayr's treatment that there must be some evidence for delay, or
at the very least "time uncertainty". As the imprint date would appear to be
1862, I am unwilling to put either (or both) of these taxa in 1863 until someone
can demonstrate that 1862 is not possible.</li>

Neophron percnopterus <strong>Spelling</strong>
<ul>
<li>Linnaeus's original spelling is clearly <i>Per<b><big>e</big></b>nopterus</i>.</li>
<li>This spelling does not seem inadvertant. The specific epithets in Linnaeus' listing are spelled both Perenopterus,
and Percnopterus.</li>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>1</b>(2):304 interprets the name as based on Hasselquist's 1757 Iter Palestinum p.209
which does indeed seem to be listed in Linnaeus's entry. It is the third (!) of his entries, the first being
"Perenopterus s. Gypa&euml;tos. <i>Aldr. orn. t. 2. c.</i> 10. <i>Raj. av.</i> 8."</li>
<li>It is not clear to my why this name is determinative of the spelling, while Linnaeus' seems to have 
intentionally chosen another spelling.</li>
<li>The text in Linnaeus's Systema Natura 10<sup>th</sup> Ed. reads:

	<li>Rainer Massmann adds additional understanding on this (<i>in litt.</i> 2008.08.16) he  
"found that both [earlier] authors, in fact, clearly used the spelling '<i>Percnopterus</i>', 
so that Linnaeus' citation is incorrect. The ICZN apparently came to the same conclusion and declared <i>perenopterus</i>
to be an incorrect original spelling (Opinion 411) and placed it on the Official Index, while <i>percnopterus</i> was placed on

<li>Peters Checklist (Mayr &amp; Greenway) have a footnote opposing use of <i>Anthus pelopus</i> Gray 1846, but base
this on the occurance of the name in Gray's Zool.Misc. where they hold it to be a <i>nomen nudum</i>.
<li>The Richmond Index also lists the Zool.Misc. presentation of the name as a <i>nomen nudum</i>, but shows the name
appearing twice in the Cat.Mamm.BirdsThibet, once on p.77 (where it is a <i>nomen nudum</i>) and on p.154 where it is

Hedydipna pallidigaster <strong>Spelling</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Originally described as <i>Anthreptes pallidigaster</i> by
Sclater and Moreau, 1935.</li>

<li>In his recent revision of the Sunbirds, <cite>Irwin. 1999 "The
genus Nectarinia and the evolution and diversification of sunbirds:
an Afrotropical perspective." Honeyguide <b>45</b>: 49.</cite>
spells the specific epithet
"<i>pallidigast<big><b>ra</b></big></i>". Presumably because the
genus of the gender <b>Hedydipna</b> is feminine.</li>

<li>However <cite>David N &amp; Gosselin M. 2002. "Gender agreement
of avian species names." BBOC. <b>122</b>(1):30</cite> discuss
Latinized Greek adjectives ending in -GASTRA and indicate that
"Original names that end in <i>-gaster</i> and that have Latin
initial components (such as <i>flavigaster</i>, <i>rufigaster</i>,
etc.) are noun phrases that end in the classical Latin noun
<i>gaster</i>, and are to be treated as nouns in apposition, with
gender ending unchanged (ICZN 1999, Art.31.2.1, 32.3, 34.2.1,

<ul>
<li>Molecular and song character analysis of the OROPENDULAS by
Price and S. Lanyon (Evolution. 2002 <b>56</b>(7):1514-1529)
suggest some systematic revision of the OROPENDULA group is needed
(<a href="./OROPENDOLAS.html" target="new_window">ABSTRACT</a>): 
<ul>
<li>Within <i>P. angustifrons</i> the subspecies <i>P. angustifrons
atrocastaneus</i> differs substantially from the other <i>P.
angustifrons</i> subspecies. Price and Lanyon do not specifically
propose elevating this to species status, though in recent years
many others have elevated subspecific taxa to species level with
much, much less support, and I anticipate that many (though not
necessarily Price and Lanyon) will take this of proof of its status
as a species. If held to be a species, the taxon would be: 
<ul>
<li>Psarocolius <b>atrocastaneus</b> <a
href="../../bio/bioc.html#Cabanis" target="ref_fr">Cabanis</a> 1873
<i><a href="../../cit/jourj.html#J.Orn."
target="ref_fr">J.Orn.</a></i> 21 p.309</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>There is strong support for excluding <i>Psarocolius oseryi</i>
from the genus <b>Psarocolius</b>, but Price and Lanyon state
(p.1523) "However, we have yet to determine this species' closest
allies within the oropendula-cacique clade, so we await a more
detailed analysis of cacique phylogeny before suggesting a revised
classification." Recent listings (<i>e.g.</i> Gill &amp; Wright 2006 and Lanyon in "The tree
of life") list this as <i>Clypicterus oseryi</i>. Within <h4>Clypicterus <a

href="../../cit/jourc.html#Consp.Gen.Av." target="ref_fr">Consp.Gen.Av.</a></i> 1 p.426
</h4></li>

<li>The song based estimates of phylogeny positioned <i>Psarocolius
viridis</i> within <b>Gymnostinops</b>, and suggested it was most
closely related to <i>Gymnostinops bifasciatus</i> (!). Further
molecular studies are underway to clarify this situation.</li>

<li>The systematics of this group remains somewhat uncertain. I
asked Kevin Burns about this and his email reply (2002.08.07) with
explanation includes this discussion:
<ul>
<li>"The Sato et al. paper reported the Darwin's finches sequences
that I used and the vegetarian finches they used were labeled with
the genus name <b>Platyspiza</b>. Likewise, the genbank records
also used <b>Platypsiza</b>. Therefore, I thought it would avoid
confusion if I followed the taxomony used in the Sato et al. paper,
although they didn't explicitly justify their taxomony.
<p>However, based on their results, one could make a case for
resurrecting <b>Platypsiza</b> (including only the Vegetarian
Finch). In their trees, they show <b>Certhidea</b> branch[ing] off
first, followed by <b>Platypsiza</b>, followed by a clade
containing uniting <b>Geospiza</b> with <b>Camarhynchus</b> and
Cocos Is. finch. Interestingly, the <b>Camarhynchus</b> species
themselves (excluding <b>Platypspiza</b>) do not show up as
individual, monophyletic species. That is, morphologically
identified species of tree finches are intermingled. This either
means that something very unusual is going on in sequence evolution
within the tree finches or the species of tree finches are not
described properly. In any case, <b>Platypspiza</b> is clearly
distinct from this cluster of <b>Camarhynchus</b> individuals."</p>

<a id="E.pictumSpell" name="E.pictumSpell"></a> Emblema pictum
<strong>Spelling</strong> 
<ul>
<li>Spelt <i>pict<b>a</b></i>. (e.g. Peters), as Gould originally
described it (in <b>Emblema</b>), or <i>pict<b>um</b></i> (e.g.
Sibley &amp; Monroe).</li>

<li><cite>David N &amp; Gosselin M. 2002. "Gender agreement of
avian species names." BBOC. <b>122</b>(1):20</cite> discuss this.
They indicate that "<i>Emblema picta</i> Gould, 1842, must be
corrected to <b><i>Emblema pictum</i></b> . <i>Emblema</i> is
neuter (ICZN 1999, Art.30.1.1)"</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>The relevant portion of 30.1.1 -- "a genus-group name that is
or ends in a Latin word takes the gender given for that word in
standard Latin dictionaries"; here (Glare, 1983) gives:
<ul>
<li>"<b>emblema</b> ~atis <i>n.</i> ... 1. An inlaid pavement,
mosaic, 2. An inlaid relief attached to the inside of a silver bowl
or sim."</li>

<li>"<b>pictus</b> ~a ~um, <i>a.</i> ... Painted."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Thus "<i>Emblema</i>" is, neuter as noted by Sibley &amp;
Monroe (following McAllan &amp; Bruce, 1988), and "<i>picta</i> /
<i>pictus</i>" is an adjective in the nominative singular. Does
that mean <i>picta</i> (the feminine form) "must" be
corrected?</li>

<li>"31.2 <b>Agreement in gender.</b> A species-group name, if it
is or ends in a Latin or latinized adjective or participle in the
nominative singular, must agree in gender with the generic name
with which it is at any time combined."</li>

<li>Are there arguments that would support <i>Emblema picta</i>? 
<ul>
<li>Should it be maintained on the basis of "prevailing usage"?
<ul>
<li>During the period of 1978-1992 only the combination <i>Emblema
pict<b>a</b></i> occurs in the <b>Zoo. Rec.</b>., where I find it
12 times. It would thus appear to be a contender for maintenance on
the basis of "prevailing usage".</li>

<li>However, Article 33.3.1 that deals with prevailing usage
pertains to "<b>in</b>correct <b>subsequent</b> spellings [which
are] in prevailing usage and [are] attributed to the publication of
the original spelling" in prevailing usage and [are] attributed to
the publication of the original spelling". (emphasis added).</li>

<li>I interpret "Emblema picta" to be a "correct original spelling"
as follows:</li>

<li style="list-style: none">
<ul>
<li>Article 32.2 <b>Correct original spelling.</b> states: "The
original spelling of a name is the "correct original spelling",
unless it is demonstrably incorrect as provided in Article
32.5."</li>

<li>32.5 states: "<b>Spellings that must be corrected (incorrect
original spellings).</b> 
<ul>
<li>32.5.1. If there is in the original publication itself, without
recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence of
an inadvertant error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist's or
printer's error, it must be corrected. Incorrect transliteration or
latinization, or use of and inappropriate connecting vowel, are not
to be considered inadvertant errors."</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Thus, 32.5.1 is not applicable (no such specific inadvertant
error has been proposed), and I don't recognize any of the other
subparts of Article 32.5 as applying. The original spelling (while
incorrect by the <b>current</b> code) would appear to be a "correct
original spelling" (<i>sensu</i> Article 32.2) [it is the original
spelling, and it is not "demonstrably incorrect as provided in
Article 32.5"]. This makes sense; it would be inappropriate and
<i>nunc pro tunc</i> to deem Gould's construction "incorrect" by
rules that were not in existance at the time he formed the
name.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>As it is not an "incorrect subsequent spelling" (as treated in
Article 33.3.1) "<i>picta</i>" does not benefit from protection on
the basis of prevailing usage.</li>

<li><i>Emblema picta</i> is a "<b>correct original</b> spelling"
(emphasis added); 33.1.1 does not apply and it must agree in gender
with <b>Emblema</b>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Thus David &amp; Gosselin's argument appears consistent with
ICZN 1999 Article 34.2 "The ending of a Latin or latinized
adjectival or participal species-group name must agee in gender
with the generic name with which is is at any time combined [Art.
31.2]; if the gender ending is incorrect it must be changed
accordingly (the author and date of the name remain unchanged [Art.
50.3.2])."</li>

They treat the two as conspecific, an interpretation that appears to

<ul>
<li>The type of the name <i>perlata</i> is an immature of:
<ul>
<li>Pyrrhura rhodogaster (<a href="../../../bio/bios.html#Sclater,PL"
target="ref_fr">Sclater,PL</a>) 1864 <i><a
href="../../../cit/jourp.html#PZS" target="ref_fr">PZS</a></i> p.298
pl.24</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>This makes that name a junior synonym of <i>P. perlata</i></li>

<li>The form previously known as <i>P. perlata</i> now becomes
<i>P. lepida</i>.</li>

<li>Generic separation from <b>Otus</b> on the basis of eye-size,
and "molecular-biological studies" (HBW <b>5</b>:182).</li>

<li>Type is currently uncertain. No type given by Kaup in erection
of genus. He included two species "Scops leucotis Sw." and "Scops
megalotis Gray" according to the Richmond Index entry. I have yet

<a id="P.pygmeusSpell" name="P.pygmeusSpell"></a> Phalacrocorax
pygmeus <strong>Systematics</strong> 
<ul class="noindent">
<li>Originally described in <b>Pelecanus</b> and spelt
"<b>pygmeus</b>".</li>

<li>Often spelt "pygm<b>a</b>eus" (e.g. Sibley &amp; Monroe, 1990
-- corrected in Supplement 1993).</li>

<li>HBW <b>1</b>:353 list it as "pygm<b>a</b>eus".</li>

<li>It appears to me that this (as previously) is an unjustified
emendation.</li>

<li>2019.02.09: In the current time, a vast frenzy of grammatical and linguistic "tidying up" is being
	forced on the world of biological nomenclature.  I think this is foolish, wrong headed and puts
	scientific considerations secondary to notions of grammatical and linguistic purity. There is <b>NO</b>
	question that is eventuates not only in nomenclatural instability, but ensures future instability.</li>
<li>I imagine this process may seem reasonable to those carrying out "linguistic cleansing" of avian nomenclature, 
	They have their work cut out for them with insect names. If they are NOT willing to undertake this cleansing
	in other taxonomic groups, perhaps the whole idea needs to be reconsidered.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, forces that I consder to be effectively anti-scientific are found increasingly present these days, and it appears to me
	that this influence has spread to biological nomenclature.</li>
<li>Under the current regime, this name is to be spelt <i>pygmaeus</i>.</li>
<li>I am reminded of when I asked a knowledgable Latin scholar to help me translate the Intoduction to Bonaparte's Consp.Gen.Av. -- all the
	translator could talk about was how "poor" Bonaparte's Latin was.</li>

<li>The units of measurement here are of interest.<br />
<b>Pouce</b> is a unit of length used in 14<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> century
France. It was replaced by the metric system during the Revolution.
France, however, fairly quickly abandoned the metric system under
Napolean, reverting (as we see here) to old systems of
measurement.<br />
<b>Pouce</b> is derived from the word for "thumb"; <b>ligne</b>
means line and is a watchmaker's measure for the thickness of a
watch movement.</p>

<p>Pouce = 1.0657 inches, 27.07 mm. 12 pouces = 1
pied-de-roi.<br />
ligne = 2.256 mm; 12 douziemes; that is 12 ligne to a pouce.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>S.F. Baird on p.XVI of vol.IX of the Pac.RRReports has a note reading:<br>
"The English inch is about equal to 11.26 French lines, .9389 French inches, or
to 25.40 Millimetres."</li>
<li>This would suggest there may be some variability in the conversion.</li>
