Strix aluco willkonskii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The original spelling of this epithet in the 1896 publication is <b><i>willko<big>u</big>skii </i></b> and can be seen here:
	<a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32475500#page/366/mode/1up" target=new>O.D. BHL Image</a></li>
	<li>The text refers repeatedly to a "Mr. Willkousky", and in THIS publication there is no indication that this
		name is misspelled.<br> 
		Later (in 1897) we can INFER that a "u" was printed where an "n" was intended. This comes from
		a note in the follwing year that PROPOSES a "correction" to the spelling of the specific epithet, but does NOT
		in fact directly indicate the spelling of the name of the gentleman after whom it is to be named.<br>
	       	That note can be seen here: <a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/32475500#page/384/mode/1up" target=new>"Correction note" BHL Image</a></li>
		<li>What to do?</li>
		<li>The Code says this:
			<h5>	32.4. Status of incorrect original spellings</h5>
			<ul>

			<li>An original spelling is an "incorrect original spelling" if it must be corrected as required in Article 32.5. An incorrect original spelling has no separate availability and cannot enter into homonymy or be used as a substitute name.</li>
			</ul>

			<h5>32.5. Spellings that must be corrected (incorrect original spellings)</h5>

			<ul>

			<li>32.5.1. If there is in the original publication itself, without recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence of an inadvertent error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist's or printer's error, it must be corrected. Incorrect transliteration or latinization, or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel, are not to be considered inadvertent errors.</li>

			<li>32.5.1.1. The correction of a spelling of a name in a publisher's or author's corrigendum issued simultaneously with the original work or as a circulated slip to be inserted in the work (or if in a journal, or work issued in parts, in one of the parts of the same volume) is to be accepted as clear evidence of an inadvertent error.</li>
			</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Is there "clear evidence of an inadvertent error" "in the original publication itself"? -- emphatically NOT.</li>
		<li>Is the correction "issued simultaneously with the original work or as a circulated slip to be inserted in the work"? -- emphatcially NOT.</li>
		<li>My interpretation (which I have learned is worth almost nothing) is that this name should be spelled as originally published (<i>willtouskii</i>)</li>
		<li>An argument of "prevailing usage" would probably be supportable, as the correction (whilst <b>not</b> valid as a correction according to the Code) was published so soon after the introduction of the name.</li>

Treron calvus wakefieldii <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>III</b>:21 (= Peters 1937) puts the authority in parentheses,
	and gives the original combination (incorrectly) as <i>Vinago wakefieldii</i>.</li>
	<li>This was described in <b>Treron</b>.</li>
	<li>Peters may have been mislead by Sclater's <i>Systema Avium Aethiopicarum </i> 
	<b>I</b>:176 (1924), where the combination is shown as "Vinago wakefieldii", and the
	original combination is omitted.</li>

Zosterops poliogastrus winifredae <strong>Citation</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>12</b>:333 (= Mayr  1967) cites this to 1935, which is simply
	wrong. This number (<b>CCCLXXX</b>) of volume <b>LV</b> of the BBOC was published 
	30 Oct. 1934.</li>
	<li>Similarly, it appears appropriate to attribute the authority to 
	Sclater &amp; Moreau, since the article commences: "Mr. W.L. Sclater exhibited and
	described, on behalf of Mr. R.E. Moreau and himself, two new birds..."</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:630 follows the Peters Checklist and corrects this date in Corrigenda 8.</li>	
	<li>As Bob Dowsett suggests, the authorial order is more properly Moreau &amp; Sclater, and I follow his suggestion (2009.05.19).</li>

Quiscalus major westoni <strong>Nomenclature Systematics</strong><p>

Nomenclature
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:190 (= Blake 1968) lists the original combination
	as <i>Quiscalus mexicanus westoni</i>.</li>
	<li>This is incorrect, as Sprunt described this in <b>Cassidix</b> as shown by
	the Richmond Index.<li>
	<li>Blake does not appear to have checked Hellmayr 1937 <b>XIII</b> ptX p.89,
	where the original combination in <b>Cassidix</b> is also shown.</li>
	<li>H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:775 also apparently simply follows
	Peters, as it does not place the authority in parentheses, even though it holds this
	as a subspecies of <i><b>Quiscalus</b> major</i>.</li>
</ul>
Systematics
<ul>
	<li>Originally described in <i>mexicanus</i>.</li>
	<li>Included in <i>major</i> by BNA, and by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:775, though why
	this is not held in <i>mexicanus</i> is not discussed in either of those presentations.</li>
	<li>My guess is that the matter of whether this is better held in <i>mexicanus</i> or <i>major</i>,
	is treated in 
	Stevenson, H. M. 1978. "The populations of Boat-tailed Grackles in the southeastern United States." 
	Proc.Biol.Soc.Wash. <b>91</b>:27-51. (not seen as of 2008.11.29).</li>

Glaucidium cuculoides whiteleyi<strong>Nomenclcature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Originally spelled <i>Athena whiteleyi</i> and named for Henry Whiteley Jr.</li>
	<li>CBBM <b>2</b>:222 (Sharpe 1875) probably started the difficulty by listing this as <i>Athene whitelyi</i> and
	this spelling has been repeated by most authors subsequently (Peters Checklist <b>4</b>:134 (= Peters 1940); 
	HBW <b>5</b>:221 (AA Weller 1999); H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:231 (2003, thru Corrigenda of 2008).</li>

Pycnonotus squamatus webberi <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>9</b>:230 (= Mayr &amp; Greenway 1960) cite the original combination
	(correctly) as <i>Ixidia webberi [sic]</i> with a double "bb". They list the name as <i>weberi</i>, but give no
	rationale or basis for what they apparently imagined was a correction.</li>
	<li>This unsupported orthography is followed by H&amp;M 3<sup><small>rd</small></sup>:566 (through Corr.8), but not
	by HBW <b>10</b>:176 (2005).</li>
	<li>The Richmond Index lists the original combination as <i>webberi</i> with a note that it was collected by "Capt. Webber".</li>
	<li>The CBBM <b>6</b>:171 also spells this <i>webberi</i>.</li>
	<li>I have not seen the original description, but it appears to me that the original spelling must stand.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:214 (= Blake &amp; Vaurie 1962) cite this to 1854 and this
	error is followed by many workers.</li>
	<li>This name was published in the supplement to vol.2 of the J.Orn. and there are multiple
	indications that it was not published until 1855 (date at foot of title page, and 
	correspondences dated "Januar 1855" on pp.LXIX and XCIII.</li>
	<li>Taxa from this supplement must be dated 1855, and presumably Dec. 31, 1855 unless and until
	data demonstrating it's availability earlier in that year becomes available.</li>

Willisornis <strong>Systematics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Molecular studies of <b>Hylophylax</b> show that inclusion of
<i>Hypocnemius poecilinota</i> Cabanis 1847 in the genus results
in a polyphyletic assemblage. <br> (ref. Brumfield RT, Tello JG,
Cheviron ZA, Carling MD, Crochet N &amp; Rosenberg KV (2007)
Phylogenetic conservatism and antiquity of a tropical
specialization: army-ant following in the typical antbirds
(Thamnophilidae). <i>Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution</i>
<b>45</b>:1-13.)</li>
<li>As pointed out by Agne CEQ, &amp; Pacheco JF (2007) employing
the 1918 Chubb name <b>Dichropogon</b> for <i>poecilinota</i>,
which is non-sister to the other <b>Hylophylax</b> taxa runs
afoul of the 1910 Dipteran genus name <b>Dichropogon</b>
Bezzi. <br>(ref. Agne CEQ, &amp; Pacheco JF "A homonomy in
Thamnophilidae: a new name for <i>Dichropogon</i> Chubb."
Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia <b>15</b>(3):484-485. Sept.
2007).</li>
<li>Agne and Pacheco do not discuss the gender of the genus group
name they propose, but it is honorific to Edwin O'Neill Willis so
I presume that <b>Willisornis</b> like <b>Hylophylax</b> is
masculine, and the combination <i>Willisornis
poecilinotus</i> is compliant with the gender-agreement
requirement currently the fashion adopted by the ICZN.</li>

<A id="S.whitneyiNomen" name="S.whitneyiNomen"></a>
Synallaxis whitneyi <strong>Nomenclature Concept</strong>
<ul>
<li>For a summary of the status of this taxon see Stopiglia R, Raposo MA. 2006. "The name <i>Synallaxis
whitneyi</i> Pacheco and Gonzaga, 1995, is not a synonym of <i>Synallaxis cinereus</i> Wied, 1831 (Aves:
Passeriformes: Furnariidae)." Zootaxa <b>1166</b>:49-55.</li>
<li>In short, Wied-Neuwied introduced the name <i>Synallaxis cinereus</i> as a replacement name for <i>Parulus
ruficeps</i> Spix, 1824. Thus the Code (ICZN 1999, Article 72.7) constrains it so that the types of <i>Synallaxis
cinereus</i> Wied-Nuewied, 1831 are the types of <i>Parulus ruficeps</i> Spix, 1824.</li>
<li>Previously the Bahia Spinetail was listed as<ul> 
<li>Synallaxis cinerea <a href="../../bio/biow.html#Wied-Neuwied" target="ref_fr">Wied-Neuwied</a> 1831 <i><a
href="../../cit/jourb.html#Beitr.Naturgesch.Brasil." target="ref_fr">Beitr.Naturgesch.Brasil.</a></i> 3 p.685</li>

</ul>

<li>It is also worth noting that there is frequently confusion regarding the spelling of the specific epithet
<i>cinerea</i> vs. <i>cinereus</i>. Wied-Neuwied spelled the name <i>cinerea</i> on the specimen lable (a MS name),
and	<i>cinereus</i> in the publication.</li>
<li>The genus group name is feminine, so <i>cinerea</i> is correct.</li>

Ptilinopus wallacii <strong>Nomenclature</strong> 
<ul> 
<li>Originally described in <b>Ptilonopus</b> and for
this reason Peters Checklist <b>3</b>:38 places the authority in parentheses. 
This is followed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:175. <!--but not by HBW <b>4</b>:217. --></li>

<li>It appears to me that <b>Ptilonopus</b> is an 1833 Selby emendation of Swainson's
<b>Ptilinopus</b>.  As an emendation it appears to me that it implies that the
authority here should not be in parentheses.</li>

Dendrocopos macei westermani <strong>Nomenclature</strong>
<ul>
<li>Listed by H&amp;M 3<sup>rd</sup>:319 as "<i>westermanni</i>" (with two
n's).</li>
<li>This appears to be anomalous, as Peters Checklist <b>6</b>:194, HBW
<b>7</b>:478, and Short (1982) p.247 all spell this with on "n". (I understand it is
to be corrected in H&amp;M 3 - Corrigenda 4).</li>
<li>The confusion may arise from <i>Muscicapula westermanni</i> =
<i>Ficedula westermanni</i> (Sharpe) 1888. PZS pt3 p.270 (spelt
"<i>westermanni</i>", O.D. seen which contains only this version of the spelling;
no direct mention of Mr Westerman is made).</li>

(1807-1890) a Dutch zoologist in the East Indies.</li>

<strong>Semeioptera wallacei/wallacii spelling</strong> A nomenclatural
nightmare here affecting the genus-group name, the spelling of the
species-group name, the author, and the citation: 
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>15</b>:188 spells this
"<i>wallac<b><big>ei</big></b></i> ".</li>

<li>Sibley &amp; Monroe, 1990 point out that Mary LeCroy argues
that the correct spelling here is
"<i>wallac<big><b>ii</b></big></i> ". <cite>LeCroy, M. 1983. BBOC.
<b>103</b>:144-145.</cite> This is followed by Sibley &amp; Monroe,
and many lists.</li>

<li>Bruce and McAllan 1990, discuss this issue in length and in
detail. They present themselves as first revisors and take the
following postions:<br />
<ul>
<li>the spelling should be "<i>wallac<big><b>ei</b></big></i>
".</li>

<li>the author should be <b>G.R. Gray</b> and not
<b>Gould</b>.</li>

<li>the citation should be Athanaeum no.1639 p.425 (published 26
March 1859).</li>

are.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>They propose <b>Gray</b> and <b>Athanaeum</b>.</li>

<li>In a related argument they maintain
<b>Sem<big>e</big>ioptera</b> is the correct spelling for the
genus-group name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, The <cite>Official Lists and Indexes of Names and Works in
Zoology. Supplement 1986-2000. 2001:85.</cite> Rules the spelling is
"wallacii", based on Opinion. 1606 (APP: not seen 02.12.25).
In the Supplement, no reference is made to the Athenaeum publication of
the name, or questions regarding the Genus-group name spelling (which
they list as "<b>Semeioptera</b>" and which they rule on in the same
opinion).</li>
<li>Thus it appears to me (not having seen the Opinion) that "stability"
of zoological nomenclature is believed best served by changing
originally published names to what it is felt they <b>should</b> have
been.</li>

more closely related to taxa that it is not placed adjacent to in the list.
The positional listing within the genus could be "geographic", which if true, in

Calyptomena whiteheadi <strong>1887</strong>
<ul>
<li>Peters Checklist <b>7</b>:13 lists "1887(1888)".</li>

<li>The Richmond Index and Duncan show this part (3) was published
in Oct. 1 1887.</li>

<li>However the details of this matter are instructive. Most of the
particulars are detailed in an article by Dickinson in the Journal of
the History of Natural History (<i>in press</i> 2004.03.28 as I write
this extension to this note).</li>
<li>This story is worth summarizing, and some additional facts lend
depth to the understanding.</li>
<ul>
	<li>Edward Dickinson contacted me questioning the
	date (1887 <i>vs</i> 1888) in the summer of 2003. In zoonomen I had
	the date listed as 1887, and in this followed both the Richmond
	Index, and Duncan.</li>

	<li>Dickinson examined a copy of the article (p.558) that lead him
	to the reasonable conclusion that it must have come out in 1888,
	that Peters' citation was correct, and that both Duncan and
	Richmond were wrong. The copy of the article initially examined by
	Dickinson has the running head:
	<pre> The Secretary on additions to the Menagerie. [Nov. 15,</pre>
	and as it is known that the material from the
	meeting of Nov. 15, (1887) was not published until 1888, it is easy
	to understand the initial interpretation that this page was not
	published until then.</li>

	<li>I felt that it was unlikely that Duncan, and more importantly,
	Richmond were wrong on this particular matter, and proposed the
	hypothesis that possibly two (or more) states of the publication
	existed. From my limited studies of this serial, I knew that
	subscriptions were available in different schedules (as individual
	parts, or numbers, or as completed volumes), and had
	noted the possibility that examination of a single set of the serial
	might not always answer a particular question as to dates of
	publication. I was excited that this conjecture might be shown to be
	true in the case of <i>Calyptomena whiteheadi</i>. 
	Dickinson (who <b>strongly</b> indicated that he felt that Richmond
	and Duncan were wrong) agreed that investigating that possibility
	was important.</li>
	<li>Dickinson's persistence and effective use of resources
	demonstrated the proposed hypothesis to be correct, thus vindicating
	both Richmond and Duncan.</li>
	<li>The details of Dickinson's article show that Ann Sylph in the
	Society's Library found an unbound set of this material which had a
	running head:<pre>
	Mr. R.B. Sharpe on a new Calyptomena. [June 23,</pre>
	and with the lower portion of the page blank.
	The initially examined copy not only had the later version of the
	running head, but had the beginning of the notes of the Nov. meeting
	at the bottom of the page (p.558).</li>
</ul>
<li>The main point to illustrate here, is that even in a serial produced
in substantial numbers, multiple <b>states</b> can exist, and that
examining only one set of a serial (or <b>examples</b> from only one
type of set) may produce an incorrect interpretation.</li>

<li>In addition, it is reassuring that Richmond (who's work is not
mentioned in Dickinson's article) is demonstrated to be correct on this
point, though his work was clearly ignored by Peters during his
preparation of vol.<b>7</b>. Further Duncan, working many decades
after Richmond, and presumably using different sources of information,
was able to correctly and independantly understand what Richmond had
already established.</li>
