Start with timetree_reduced_taxa_OW_2019.nextree.tre
Will use tree with root constraint.
extractd as trc.001
	1. first make each taxon a new line.

		tr '\t' '\n' <trc.001 > trc.002

	2. remove parentheses -- these are needed only to produce tree structure.
		 sed -e 's/(//g' -e 's/)//g' trc.002 > trc.003

		 Now looks like this:

	tree with_root_constraint = [&R]
	Struthio_camelus_STRUTHIONIFORMES_Struthionidae:64.243358
	Apteryx_mantelli_APTERYGIFORMES_Apterygidae:51.592404
	Mullerornis_sp_AEPYORNITHIFORMES_Aepyornithidae:16.155516
	Aepyornis_maximus_AEPYORNITHIFORMES_Aepyornithidae:16.155516:35.436888:8.868225

	3. next we want to restrict the file to just taxon and terminal br. length
		so if colon (:) is field separator, just print $1,$2.

	4. awk -F ":" '{print $1,$2}' trc.003 > trc.004

	5. So now we have:

	$ head trc.004
	tree with_root_constraint = [&R]
	Struthio_camelus_STRUTHIONIFORMES_Struthionidae 64.243358
	Apteryx_mantelli_APTERYGIFORMES_Apterygidae 51.592404
	Mullerornis_sp_AEPYORNITHIFORMES_Aepyornithidae 16.155516
	Aepyornis_maximus_AEPYORNITHIFORMES_Aepyornithidae 16.155516
	Anomalopteryx_didiformis_DINORNITHIFORMES_Emeidae 55.540828
	Crypturellus_tataupa_TINAMIFORMES_Tinamidae 30.169303
	Tinamus_guttatus_TINAMIFORMES_Tinamidae 13.306222
	Tinamus_major_TINAMIFORMES_Tinamidae 13.306222
	Eudromia_elegans_TINAMIFORMES_Tinamidae 37.890498

	II.

	Now. we want genus group name to have:
		a prepended sequence number from 10.2
		a suffix that includes large scale geographic information.

		So Struthio_camelus should look:
		_00001_Struthio_camelus_AF

		So NOW the task is to creat a list from 10.2 that has 
		Gen_sp_GEOREG for species.


	i111 tax now looks like this: colon used for Geo separator.
	 Struthio_camelus_AF
	 Struthio_molybdophanes_AF
	 Rhea_americana_SA
	 Rhea_pennata_SA
	 Apteryx_australis_AU
	 Apteryx_mantelli_AU
	 Apteryx_rowi_AU
	 Apteryx_owenii_AU
	 Apteryx_haastii_AU
	 Casuarius_casuarius_AU
	 Casuarius_bennetti_AU
	 Casuarius_unappendiculatus_AU
	 Dromaius_novaehollandiae_AU
	 Tinamus_tao_SA
	 Tinamus_solitarius_SA
	 Tinamus_osgoodi_SA
	 Tinamus_major_MA:SA
	 Tinamus_guttatus_SA
	 Nothocercus_bonapartei_MA:SA


NOTES:

This from Rebecca Kimball
In terms of expectations (and your box plot of emberizids/thraupids - I have not yet digested the document with all the data from varying groups), I can see two things that should affect terminal branches (which you have alluded to):
1) evolutionary rates. It is clear some taxa seem to have faster rates of evolution - this is likely due to elevated mutation rates and/or to elevated rates of fixation of mutations (e.g., small populations may lead to greater rates of fixation, fixation rates may also be affected by whether mutations are beneficial or detrimental, etc.).
2) classification. As you commented on cisticolids, if we split something into many species we subdivide branches (short terminals) and if we lump things we end up with long terminals. I have wondered (and there is an old paper from Sibley in the 1950â€™s - I think 1957 but my memory is not great for that sort of thing) that gets at these issues. When taxa (or at least males) are very different in appearance, we tend to split, and if things look more similar, we tend to lump. So emberizids might have long terminals as the plumage differences do not appear large to us, so we define things as a species that perhaps should be multiple species (and possibly in thraupids  we considered each obvious coloration change as reflecting a different species).
