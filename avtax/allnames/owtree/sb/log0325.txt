Took one tree [MRL--BigBird.tre}
	Assumed that the first number after the taxon name was the
	txpreminal branch length for that taxon.

	I created a file trimmed of other branch lenghts (i.e. just
	taxon name and one number (the first or only) from the
	presumed branch lengths list.

	Altered genus group name so it was prepended by a five digit
	number representing the genus sequence from IOC 10.1
	(This step is not necessary for consideration of the
	question I raise here, but it allow for looking at
	results in linear "checklist" sequence -- while I understand
	that it is semi-meaningless to present a tree structure as
	a linear sequence).

	I multiplied the branch length number by 1k. Visual comparison
	of very small multiple-digit numbers is annoyingly difficult,
	and error prone.

	So the resultant records looks like this. (field separator is space)

	Taxon ORDER Family TBrLenx1000
	_00001_Struthio_camelus STRUTHIONIFORMES Struthionidae 0.002248
	_00003_Apteryx_rowi APTERYGIFORMES Apterygidae 0.660489


	At this point I speculated what bird would have the longest
	terminal branch length?

	My (ignorant) guesses -- Ostrich (already out of the running)
	Some Loon? some mousebird? some Tinamou? Hoatzin?
	(personally rooting for a mousebird).


	So I sorted the data by  terminal branch length, and here
	is the end of the list (largest number last).

YO! seems hard to believe, and makes me think something is wrong
Could the Vesper Sparrow REALLY have the second longest terminal branch length??
Well it IS a monotypic genus, so that is perhaps in its favor, but a Passeriform?

My strong suspicion is that something is not right. Perhaps I misunderstood what you said
and the first number FOLLOWING the taxon name is NOT the terminal branch length for
that taxon?

Alterntively, perhaps I am looking at data from a tree which is inappropriate for what
I am trying to do?


Even if I am looking at the wrong number, there is, at least for me, some head scratching.
The distribution of the number selected looks as if it almost certainly is NOT a single
variable.

So,, I guess I will try looking at the LAST number in the branch-length string.
But before I do that I thought it would be reassuring to hear if I am looking
at the right tree for what I am trying to do.

I SUPPOSE it is possible that the terminal-branch length number is not always in one 
location in the string, and the wizardry of the tree drawing programs figures out which 
number to use for drawing the terminal branch.  In such a case, I am (as near as I can
tell) out of luck.
