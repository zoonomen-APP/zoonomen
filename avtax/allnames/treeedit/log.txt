1. Separate records ? by tab?
	commas separete records with no space.
	recsep.sed sed 's/,/	 /g'
2. separate records -- there is a sed tool for this.
	sed -e 'y/\t/\n/'
	# -e needed for regex, apparently
3. remove parentheses
4. Change genus name to numbered name with established sed script.
5. Change genus name to Psliopogon.





Tree coding:
		MRP = matrix representation with parsimony (strict consensus of all MP trees)
		MRL = matrix representation with likelihood
		
		MajRuleExt = extended majority rule (greedy) consensus of 100 bootstrap supertrees
		bootlabel  = optimal trees with bootstrap support as labels
		             Note: the topology for MRx_3backbone and MRx_3backbone_bootlabel 
		                   (x = P or L) are identical, the only difference it the labels

		3backbone = all three backbone trees included
		Brown     = Brown JW, Wang N, Smith SA. 2017. The development of scientific consensus:
