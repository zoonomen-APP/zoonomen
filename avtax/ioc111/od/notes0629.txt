The way to proceed will be to take additional sections and process them 
with the prepare script.
Then cat them with the previously completed body AND new head and tail
I will make a body which is eveything but the
head and tail.
Will call it base001.txt
NOTE:
to remove quotes from strings containing commas this must be done before
creating the html files..because quotes are needed in hyperlinks 
Implying that it must be done after the first version of the spreadsheet 
segment is taken. That is to say around the time the tabs are replaced with pipes.
