This work (Bulletin No. 50) i.s one of a series of papers intended to 

 illustrate the collections belonging to, or placed under the charge of, 

 the Smithsonian Institution, and deposited in the United States National 

 Museum. 



The publications of the National Museum consist of two series: the 

 Bulletin and the Procendingii. 



The Bulletin's publication of which was commenced in 1875, is a series 

 of elaborate papers, issued separately' and based for the most part upon 

 collections in the National Museum. They are monogi-aphic in scope 

 and are devoted principally to the discussion of large zoological groups, 

 bibliographies of eminent naturalist^, reports of expeditions, etc. The 

 Bulletins, issued only as volumes with one exception, are of octavo 

 size, although a quarto form, known as the Special Bulletin, has 

 been adopted in a few instances in which a larger page was deemed 

 indispensable. 



The Proceedlru/K (octavo), the first volume of which was issued in 

 1878, are intended primarily as a medium of publication for newly 

 acquired facts in biologj', anthropology and geology, descriptions of 

 new forms of animals and plants, discussions of nomenclature, etc. A 

 volume of about 1,000 pages is issued annually for distribution to 

 libraries, while a limited edition of each paper in the volume is printed 

 and distributed in pamphlet form in advance. 



In addition, there are printed each year in the second volume of the 

 Smithsonian Report (known as the ' ' Report of the National Museum ") 

 papers, chiefly of an ethnological character, describing collections in 

 the National Museum. 



Papers intended for publication by the National Museum are usually 

 referred to an Advisory Committee, composed as follows: Frederick 

 W. True (chairman), William H. Holmes, George P. Merrill, James 

 E. Benedict, Otis T. Mason, Leonhard Stejneger, Lester F. Ward, and 

 Marcus Benjamin (editor).

DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY 



'SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD, 



America's first and best systematic ornithologist; whose guiding 

 principle, "What is worth doing is worth doing well," is evident 

 through all his works; who labored for the advancement of science, 

 not for fame. Originator of the term "Middle America," and pioneer 

 in the ornithology of that geographic field, his Review of American 

 Birds, although scarcely more than begun, remains a perfect type of 

 systematic ornithology and the model from which many later writers 

 have drawn their inspiration. 





PREFACE. 



Although preparations for the present work have been more or less 

 actively conducted for some twenty years past, as time and opportu- 

 nity permitted, the actual work of putting together the vast amount 

 of material accumulated during that period was not begun until Sep- 

 tember, LS!)4, when the author was directed by Dr. G. Brown Goode, 

 Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of the 

 National Museum, to consider of paramount importance among his 

 official duties the task of "making available, through publication, the 

 results of the ornithological work of the Government, as represi'nted 

 in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution." The labor of collat- 

 ing references pertaining to more than 3,000 species of birds, verifying 

 citations of original descriptions, measuring many thousands of speci- 

 mens, and other time-consuming details connected with the preparation 

 of such a work has necessarily delayed the beginning of its publication; 

 but most of this drudgery having been disposed of, it is hoped that 

 future progress may be more rapid. 



In the following pages the attempt is made to describe every species 

 and subspecies, or definable form, of bird found on the continent of 

 North America, from the arctic districts to the eastern end of the. 

 Isthmus of Panama, together with those of the West Indies and other 

 islands of the Caribbean Sea (except Trinidad and Tobago), and the 

 Galapagos Archipelago; introduced and naturalized species being 

 included, as well as accidental or casual visitors. 



The classification presented is essentially that of the most recent and 

 advanced authorities,^ with such minor modifications as in the judg- 

 ment of the present author seem desirable. The imperfection of our 

 knowledge concerning the internal structure of many groups of birds, 

 however, makes an entirely satisfactory classification impossible at the 

 present time, and that here adopted must therefore be considered as 

 provisional only. An entirely sound classification of birds is a matter 

 of the future, requiring vastly extended investigations in the field of 

 avian anatomy and the expenditure of an enormous amount of time 

 and labor in elaborating the results. 



Some effort has been made to establish the proper terminology of 

 the higher groups, no fixed rule having been followed in this respect, 



' These are specially mentioned on pages 6, 7. 




VIII PREFACE. 



and the law of priority, so rigidly applied to genera and species, quite 

 generally ignored. The synonymy of these higher groups, as given, 

 is by no means complete, however, but little time being available for 

 its compilation. 



The matter of determining the limits of families and genera among 

 birds is one of great difficulty, especially among the Passeres; partly 

 because such groups are often not clearly defined, but also because the 

 material necessary for determining such questions is not always avail- 

 able. The question of what constitutes a "family" or a "genus" 

 being involved, and, moreover, one concerning which there is much dif- 

 ference of opinion among systematists, the author's views may be stated, 

 in order to make clear the principles which have been his guide in the 

 present work. 



Accepting evolution as an established fact — and it is difficult to 

 understand how anyone who has studied the subject seriously can by 

 any possibility believe otherwise— there are no "hard and fast lines," 

 no gaps, or "missing links" in the chain of existing animal forms 

 except as they are caused by the extinction of certain intermediate 

 types 5^ therefore, there can be no such group as a family or genus (nor 

 any other for that matter) unless it is cut oflf from other groups by the 

 existence of such a gap; because unless thus isolated it can not be 

 defined, and therefore has no existence in fact. These gaps being very 

 unequally distributed, it necessarily follows that the groups thus formed 

 are very unequal in value; sometimes alternate links in the chain may 

 be missing; again, several in continuous sequence are gone, while occa- 

 sionally a series of several or even numerous links may be intact. It thus 

 happens that some family or generic groups seem very natural or homo- 

 geneous, because the range of generic or specific variation is not great 

 and there is no near approach to the characters of another coordinate 

 group, while others seem verj^ artificial or heterogeneous because 

 among the many generic or specific forms none seem to have dropped 

 out, and therefore, however great the range of variation in structural 

 details, no division into trenchant groups is practicable — not because 

 extreme division would result, but simply because -there can be no 

 proper definition of groups which do not exist.* In short, no group, 

 whether of generic, family, or higher rank, can be valid unless it 

 can be defined by characters which serve to distinguish it from every 

 other. 



In groups of wide geographic range it is of course necessary to have 

 all its components in hand in order to detemiine its limits and the 

 number and boundaries of its subdivisions, for what seem distinct 



'In some cases such apparent gaps are no doubt filled by existing forms which are 

 as yet unknown to science. 

 ^ Certain so-called genera of the family Fringillida) afford a striking illustration. 




PREFACE. TX 



families or genera within the limits of a fauna may, when all the forms 

 of an entire continent or zoOgeographic " region," or the world at large, 

 are examined, be found to be connected by intermediate " extralim- 

 ital" forms. Sometimes, however, this test proves exactly the reverse 

 to be true. Therefore, in the present work the families and genera 

 recognized have not been based on the species belonging to North and 

 Middle America alone, but on all others that were available, so far as 

 time permitted. 



It is often difficult to weigh accurately the value of structural dif- 

 ferences; there are many cases in which the author has long remained 

 undecided what course to adopt, but decision, one way or another, has 

 been necessary, and it only remains to be said that in such cases the 

 benefit of any doubt has been given to established usage, in order not 

 to disturb current nomenclature by unnecessary innovations. 



The question of whether a given form should be considered as a 

 species or a subspecies is very much a matter of material, both from 

 a geographic and a numerical point of view. The greater the number 

 of closely related forms, hitherto regarded as specifically distinct, that 

 are examined — especiallj' when representing intermediate localities — 

 the fewer becomes the number of those which are really specifically 

 distinct. As in the case of genera, very different extremes are often 

 connected by a series of intergrading forms, approaching one or 

 the other of the extreme types exactly in proportion to their geo- 

 graphic position between them; and other forms much less different 

 appear to be really distinct through absence of "intergrades." In 

 determining questions of this class the author has exercised the fullest 

 independence, without reference, so far as North American forms are 

 concerned, to the rulings of the committee of the American Ornithol- 

 ogists' Union; ^ not from lack of. confidence in the committee's judg- 

 ment, but from a full knowledge of the unsatisfactory conditions as 

 to time and material under which their conclusions were usually 

 reached. Satisfactory decisions affecting the status of described but 

 still dubious forms is a question both of material and investigation, 

 and the author holds that no conclusion in such a matter should be 

 accepted unless based upon an amount of material and careful investi 

 gation equal to that bestowed by the original describer. 



Recognizing the fact that in the present stage of zoological nomen- 

 clature trinomials are a "necessary evil," the author has not hesitated 

 to use them when such relationship was clearly indicated by the evi- 

 dence. He has not, however, often done so on theoretical grounds, 

 because, in the first place, the facts when known may or may not 

 justify the step, and in the second because a binomial is preferable to 

 a trinomial when there is any good excuse for its adoption. The

(editions of 1886, 1889, and 1895) and various supplements to the same. 




X PREFACE. 



greatest difficulty in deciding questions of this kind is in the case of 

 insular forms, among which occur every possible degree of difference 

 between related forms inhabiting different islands, so that it not only 

 becomes largely a matter of individual judgment as to which should 

 be given specific and which subspecific rank, but furthermore the dis- 

 tinction made must, in the case of any author, necessarily be more or 

 less arbitrary, since no "hard and fast rule" for determining such 

 questions seems possible. 



As observed before, the more familiar one becomes with the subject 

 through the medium of specimens representing continuous geographic 

 sequence of localities the fewer in number really distinct species become, 

 and what have long been considered such resolve themselves, one by 

 one, into a connected scries of subspecific forms, each representing a 

 definite geographic area of more or less marked peculiarities of topog- 

 raphy, climate, or other physical features. Such forms are fixed, or 

 "true," over territory of uniform physical character, the intergrades 

 coming from the meeting ground of two such areas. Such a group of 

 conspecific forms may aptly be compared to the colors of the solar 

 spectrum, which form a graded scale from red, through orange, yellow, 

 green, and blue, to violet, with intermediate hues of greater or less 

 number, according to the nature of the case requiring their indication 

 by name. These colors of the spectrum, though imperceptibly run- 

 ning into one another, are obviously distinct, and the necessity of recog- 

 nizing them by name has never been questioned. 



•To carry the comparison still further, a certain species may include 

 six subspecies or conspecific forms, which for convenience may be 

 designated by the subspecific names rnhra,^i(in'a)itiaca,Jlava,viridis, 

 cyanea, and violaceu. Intermediates between these might be designated 

 as ruhro-aurantiaca (or rmrantiaco-ruira, according to which form the 

 intermediate most resembles), aurantiaGO-jiava (or flamo-aurantiava)^ 

 flavo-olridis, niridi-cyanea. and cyaneo-viohicea^ i. e., red-orange (or 

 orange-red), orange-yellow (or yellow-orange), yellow-green, green- 

 blue, and blue-violet of the color scale. The necessitj' for such a 

 nomenclature is just as great in zoology (and botany) as in chromato- 

 graphy; and to ignore this necessity is neither scientific nor sensible, 

 but on the other hand is nothing less than suppression or perversion 

 of an obvious truth. The only question that can possibly exist in the 

 mind of those who ha\^e this matter to deal with is the degree of dif- 

 ference which should be recognized in nomenclature, and in this respect 

 there is excuse for more or less difference of opinion, according to one's 

 ability to discern differences and estimate the degree of their con- 

 stancy, the extent and character of material studied, and the amount of 

 time which has been devoted to its investigation. No doubt many of 

 the forms which the author has recognized as subspecies in the present 

 work may appear trivial to others, especially those who have not had 




PEEFACE. XI 



advantage of the material upon which they are based; but in all caHo.s 

 it has been the author's desire to express exactly the facts as they appear 

 to him in the light of the evidence examined, without any regard 

 whatever to preconceived ideas, either of his own or of others, and 

 without consideration of the inconvenience which may result to those 

 who are inclined to resent innovations, f oi-getful of the fact that knowl- 

 edge can not be complete until all is known. This question of species 

 and subspecies and their nice discrimination is not the trivial matter 

 that some who claim a broader view of biological science affect to 

 believe. It is the very foundation of more advanced scientific work; 

 and without secure foundation no architect, however skillful, can rear 

 a structure that will endure. 



The nomenclatural rules followed are those of the American Orni- 

 thologists' Union, as presented in their "Code of Nomenclature." 

 These have been strictly adhered to in all respects. 



The synonymies of this work have proven by far the most laborious 

 part of its preparation, great pains having been taken to verify refer- 

 ences whenever practicable, to include all which may be of use to those 

 desiring an index to the literature of each species and to exclude those 

 which would not serve some particular purpose. Special features are 

 the mention of the type locality and location of the type specimen 

 whenever it has been practicable to determine the same; the mention 

 of all nomenclatural combinations and variations, and reproduction of 

 the exact form in which the name accompanying each citation was 

 originally given. When the locality to which a citation refers can be 

 ascertained it has been given, the purpose being twofold: Future 

 workers in a more limited geographic field may thereby more easily 

 consult the literature concerning it, and when it mav hereafter become 

 necessary to further subdivide a given species or subspecies the refer- 

 ences may be assorted without the time-consuming labor of consulting 

 the numerous books and papers cited. Regarding the matter of 

 orthography, etc., in citations, the extreme exactness which has been 

 attempted may seem both useless and pedantic. It is believed, how- 

 ever, that while the utmost accuracy of this kind can do no harm it 

 may — in respect to some aspects of the case certainly will — do much 

 good as a reaction from the gross carelessness which has hitherto 

 prevailed. Anyone who has had occasion to verify citations must 

 know that the amount of inaccuracy and misrepresentation in current 

 synonymies, even the most authoritative and elaborate, is simply 

 astounding. They abound with names which do not even exist in the 

 works cited, with-those which do not correspond with the orio'inals in 

 orthography, and others which have no meaning or use whatever, 

 being evidently culled from indices without reference to what their 

 status may be on the pages indicated. The correction of an author's 

 orthographical errors is a pernicious practice, though much in vogue; 




XII PREFACE. 



"science is not literature," neither has it any concern with what an 

 author should have done or meant to do, but only with what he 

 actually did. 



Without the special arrangements for the preparation of this work 

 made by the late Dr. G. Brown Goode (as mentioned at the beginning 

 of this preface) and continued by his successors, Dr. Charles D. Wal- 

 cott and Mr. Richard Rathbun, the accomplishment of the task would 

 have been quite impracticable. These arrangements, it should be 

 stated, are all that are possible under existing circumstances, though 

 by no means all that could be desired for its early completion. 



Notwithstanding the great extent of the collection of birds in the 

 United States National Museum, which is much the largest and most 

 nearly complete of any in America, and of North American birds 

 unquestionablj' the finest in existence, so many groups are inadequately 

 represented that it has been necessary to borrow specimens from other 

 collections for study in connection with this work. It is a great pleas- 

 ure to the author that he is able to say that such aid has, almost with- 

 out excejjtion, been most willingly and promptly rendered by those 

 having it in their power to do so. The unrivaled collection of Mexican 

 birds,' as well as very numerous specimens from the United States 

 (including Alaska) and the British Provinces, belonging to the United 

 States Biological Survey (Department of Agriculture) has been kindly 

 placed in the author's hands for study by the Dire^ctor of the Survey, 

 Dr. C. Hart Merriam. The entire collection of each family belonging 

 to the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, has 

 been lent for the same purpose, whenever requested,'* by the authori- 

 ties of that institution, through Dr. J. A. Allen, Curator of the Depart- 

 ment of Vertebrate Zoology, these including many types of Mr. George 

 N. Lawrence, so essential to any investigation of the birds of tropical 

 America. The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, through 



1 For this magnificent collection of Mexican birds ornithologists are indebted to 

 the intelligent and energetic labors of Mr. E. \V. Nelson, whose careful, thorough, 

 and protracted field work has covered nearly every portion of that most interesting 

 section of the continent. It illustrates, to a degree which no other collection from 

 that country approaches, the remarkable variations, often within small areas, mani- 

 fest in many of the birds, resulting from unusually varied topographic features and 

 climatic conditions. Without a careful study of Mr. Nelson's collection, which 

 includes the types of numerous new species and subspecies described by him, a fairly 

 accurate knowledge of the geographic distribution and variations of Mexican birds 

 would not be possible. The inestimable value of this collection in the preparation 

 of the present work has been greatly enhanced by Mr. Nelson's kind assistance, both 

 verbally and by means of a map, colored by him to show the different faunal areas, 

 thereby explaining most clearly why marked variations often occur in birds of locali- 

 ties not far separated as to distance but in reality very different in physical character. 



^ These include, to date, their entire representation of the families of Fringillidie, 

 Icteridss, and Corvidse. 




PREFACE. XIII 



Mr. Witmer Stone, Conservator of the Ornithological Section/ and 

 the Field Columbian Museum, Chicago, through Mr. C. B. Cory, Cura- 

 tor of the Department of Ornithologj',' have likewise responded most 

 generously to requests for the loan of specimens, as has also the Boston 

 Society of Natural History, the last-mentioned establishment furnishing 

 a number of Lafresnaye's types. 



The Costa Rica National Museum, through its former Director, 

 Senor Anastasio Alfaro, has materially aided in the preparation of this 

 work by the loan and gift of a large number of most interesting sjiec- 

 imens. The author is likewise greatly indebted for similar assistance 

 to Seiior Jos6 C. Zeledon, of San Jose, and Mr. George K. Cherrie, 

 formerly connected with the Costa Rica National Museum, especially 

 the former, who has not only donated many hundreds of specimens to 

 the United States National Museum, but has in addition given mucli 

 valuable information through correspondence. 



Besides the public institutions and their officers mentioned above 

 the author is under obligations to many individuals for similar aid. 

 These are far too numerous to permit all being mentioned by name. 

 Those who have rendered the greatest assistance are Mr. William 

 Brewster, of Cambridge, and Mr. Outram Bangs, of Boston, Massachu- 

 setts; Mr. A. W. Anthony, of San Diego, Mr. R. C. McGregor, of 

 Palo Alto, and Mr. Joseph Grinnell, of Pasadena, California. 



Although the drudgery of measuring thousands of specimens and 

 compiling practically all the references for the synonymy has fallen on 

 the author, considerable assistance in these matters has been rendered 

 by others. Most of the FringillidaB, Corvidse, and Mniotiltidse were 

 measured by Mr. J. H. Riley, Aid in the Division of Birds; the 

 IcteridaB, the' Ccerebidse, and part of the Mniotiltidse were measured 

 by Mr. Sidney S. Wilson. Dr. C. W. Richmond, Assistant Curator 

 of the Division of Birds, has supplied many references, especially 

 of uncited combinations, while Mr. W. P. Hay has gone carefully 

 over the manuscript of the first volume and supplied, from the origi- 

 nals, such data as to pagination, type locality, etc., as had been omitted 

 or mai'ked as doubtful. 



In conclusion, the author desires to say that while unavoidable limi- 

 tations have prevented the realization of his ideal in the present work, 

 no pains nor labor have been spared to make it the best that was prac- 

 ticable under the circumstances.

NOTE. 



The necessity for beginning this work with the highest instead of 

 the lowest forms is to be regretted, and may be explained by briefly 

 stating that owing to inadequate facilities for properly arranging the 

 larger birds in the National Museum collection these are not available 

 for study, and consequently it became necessary either to begin with 

 the smaller birds, already systematically arranged, or else postpone 

 the work indefinitely. 



The descriptions arc limited to essential characters, but extreme 

 brevity has been avoided in order to render identification more certain. 

 In the case of subspecies, however, only those characters which are 

 peculiar to each are mentioned, the fuller description of the first in a 

 group of conspecific forms applying to all of those which follow, except 

 as modified by the diagnosis pertaining to each of the latter. 



Measurements are in millimeters, and are made in the following 

 manner: 



(1) Length, from tip of bill to tip of tail of the dried skin. This 

 measurement is really of little value, and is given merely as a sort of 

 clue to the general size of the bird. It varies greatly in the same 

 species according to the "make " of the skin,' and is usually materially 

 different from the same measurement before skinning. 



(2) Wing, measured with dividers, one point resting against the 

 anterior side of the bend the other touching the extremity of the 

 longest primarj^ 



(3) Tail, measured with dividers, one point of which is inserted 

 between the shafts of the middle pair of rectrices at the base and 

 pressed forward as far as they will go without splitting the integu- 

 ment, the other point touching the extremity of the longest rectrix. 



(4) Cuhnen, measured with dividers, either from the extreme base 

 or exposed base — that is, the base as seen without parting the frontal 

 feathers — the character of the measurement always being indicated as 

 "culmen from base" and "exposed culmen." 



(5) Depth of Bill at base, measured with dividers from lower edge 

 of mandibular rami to highest portion of the culmen. 



' Specimens of conspicuously extended or abbreviated make have, however, been 

 excluded from measurement. 




XVI NOTE. 



(6) Width of hill, at iase, measured across the chin l)ctween the out- 

 side of the gnathidea at their base. 



(7) Tarsus^ measured from the tibio-tarsal or heel joint 07i the outer 

 side to the lower end. This last point is often more or less indefinite 

 and sometimes very difficult to locate, but in such cases may usually 

 be ascertained by flexing the toes. 



(8) Middle toe, measured from the lower end of the tarsus to the base 

 of the claw, the length of the latter not being included, unless so stated. 



(9) GradiMtion of tail, measured from the extremity of the outer- 

 most rectrix to that of the middle or longest, the tail being closed. 



Owing to the considerable individual variation in measurements in 

 almost all birds, measurements of a single specimen are of little value as 

 part of a description of a species or subspecies. In such a case the meas- 

 urements are quite as likely to represent the maximum or minimum 

 dimensions of the form as the average. Therefore, in connection with 

 the present work, a series of specimens of each form has, whenever 

 practicable, been carefully measured, and the minimum, maximum, 

 and average of each separate measurement given with the descriptions. 



The average measurements, as given, do not always express actual 

 difference or agreement, as the case may be, between allied forms 

 because, in the first place, the series measured are too often unequal and 

 inadequate, and in the second, determination of sex by collectors is 

 not always to be relied on, measurements of one sex sometimes almost 

 certainly figuring among those of the other. Besides, a certain allow- 

 ance must be made for errors of measurement, it being a well known 

 fact that the same person can rarely measure the same specimen twice 

 and obtain exactly the same results. It may be stated, however, that 

 great care has been taken to have the measurements given represent the 

 facts as nearly as possible, by selecting as nearlj^ equal a series of each 

 allied form as the available material would allow, and by eliminating 

 immature specimens and those with abraded primaries and rectrices, 

 as well as those whose sex had not been determined by the collector or 

 is otherwise not obvious. 



In describing the wing-formula or relative lengths of the primary 

 remiges, these are counted from the innermost one outward, not con- 

 versely, as has been the general practice. Hence, in "ten-primaried" 

 birds the outermost primary is designated as the tenth, and in "uine- 

 primaried" birds as the ninth. The advantage of this innovation, 

 which no doubt will at first cause inconvenience, is that in the case of 

 "nine-primaried" birds the outermost obvious primary (the ninth) 

 receives its correct numerical designation, whereas according to the old 

 inethod of numeration it was designated as the first while being in 

 reality the second.'

NOTE. XVII 



The analytical keys of the present work are on the same plan as 

 those in the author's Manual of North American Birds;' that is, 

 the diagnostic characters of all subdivisions are contrasted in dichoto- 

 mous series of antithetical phrases. Many modifications of this plan 

 and others essentiallj^ different have been experimented with or tested, 

 but none have been found to possess equal simplicitj'^ of construction 

 or facility of practical use. The keys of the present work differ from 

 those of the Manual in this respect, however; the latter are a com- 

 bination of "key" and diagnosis, while the former consist entire!}' of 

 a key based only on the exclusively diagnostic characters. Although 

 the plan of these keys is so simple that directions for their use seem 

 hardly necessarj^ it may be as well to explain the method of their use. 

 The dichotomous characters are arranged alphabetically, thus, "a" is 

 the antithesis of "aa " , ' ' ^ " that of " 55 ", etc. ; therefore if the characters 

 mentioned following- "a " do not apply to the specimen in hand then 

 they must be sought for under after "aa". It will, of course, be 

 found that either the characters following "a" or those following "aa " 

 do apply, unless the specimen happens to be a new species or the key 

 to the wrong genus (or other group) is being used. When its posi- 

 tion as to "a" or "aa" has been fixed, the next step is to find whether 

 it belongs to "5" or " W under "a" or "aa," as its position may 

 have been determined; then whether in "c" or '■''cc,^'' and so on, or 

 until the species or subspecies is "run down.'"' 



The names of colors used are those of the author's Nomenclature of 

 Colors.'

THE BIRDS 



NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 



By KOBEET RIDGWAY, 



Cwrator, Diris'ion of Binh. 



Ornithology ("from opviO-, crude form of opvig, a bird, and Xoyla, 

 allied to Xoyos, commonly Englished a discourse")' is '"the method- 

 ical study and consequent knowledge of birds, with all that relates 

 thereto.'" 



There are two essentially different kinds of ornithology: systematic 

 or scientific, and 2^opular. The former deals with the structure and 

 classification of birds, their synonymies and technical descriptions. 

 The latter treats of their habits, songs, nesting, and other facts per- 

 taining to their life-histories. Although apparently distinct from one 

 another, these two branches of ornithology are in reality closely related 

 and to a degree interdependent. The systematist who does not possess 

 an intimate knowledge of the habits of birds, their mode of nidifica- 

 tion, the character of their nests, eggs, and young, is poorly equipped 

 for the work he has in hand, while the popular writer who is ignorant 

 of scientific ornithology and who neglects to keep in touch with its 

 progress is placed at an equal disadvantage — his writing's may enter^ 

 tain, but are far more apt to mislead, through erroneous statements, 

 than educate. Popular ornithology is the more entertaining, with its 

 savor of the wild wood, green fields, the riverside and seashore, bird 

 songs, and the many fascinating things connected with out-of-door 

 Nature. But systematic ornithology, being a component part of 

 biology — the science of life — is the more instructive and therefore 

 more important. Each advance in this serious study reveals just so

much more of the hidden irij^steries of creation, and adds proportion- 

 atel}' to the sum of human knowledge/ 



Birds constitute a far more homogeneous group than any other class 

 of the animal kingdom, and their classification is therefore a matter of 

 unusual difficulty. According to universal agreement, they constitute 

 a single class, Aves, whose characters and subdivisions (according to 

 our present knowledge) are as follows: 



CLASS AVES.— BIRDS. 



Birds iiXQ feathered veirtebrate animals. ^ 



The more recent investigations of comparative anatomists have grad- 

 uall}' eliminated the supposed exclusive characters of birds, as a Class 

 of the Animal Kingdom, until only the single one mentioned above, 

 the possession of feathers, remains. No other structural character is 

 possessed by them which is not shared either bj^ the Class Reptilia or 

 Class Mammalia; but "no bird is without feathers, and no animal is 

 invested with feathers except the birds. " ' Indeed, so closely are birds 

 related to reptiles that in all other structural characters whereby they 

 differ from mammals they agree with reptiles; and notwithstanding 

 their extreme dissimilarity in appearance and habits they are essentially 

 "an extremely modified and aberrant Reptilian type."* 



Birds differ from all Mammals in the following characters: 



(1) Possession of feathers. 



(2) Absence of milk glands. 



(3) Single occipital condyle. 



'The most complete review of the history of ornithology is that forming the 

 introduction to Professor Newton's Dictionary of Birds (London: Adam and Charles 

 Black, 1893-1896; The Macmillan Company, New York). 



■^ The following diagnosis of the class is given by Gadow, in Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 

 1892, p. 236: 



Oviparous, warm-blooded, amniotic vertebrates which have their anterior extrem- 

 ities transformed into wings. Metacarpus and fingers carrying feathers or quilla. 

 AVith an intertarsal joint. Not more than four toes, of which the first is the hallux. 



This later (A Classification of Vertebrata recent and extinct, 1898, p. 30) amended 

 as follows: 



Warm-blooded, oviparous, Amniota, AUantoidae. Occipital condyle single. Quad- 

 rate movable. Anterior extremities transformed into wings. Covered with feath- 

 ers. With intertarsal joint. Not more than four toes, of which the first is the 

 hallux.

 lent article (pp. 1-20 of the work cited) should be consulted by those who desire 

 more detailed information on the subject.

(4) Articulation of the lower jaw with a separate bone {ox quad- 

 Tdtum), which again articulates with the skull. 

 (.5) Absence of a diaphragm. 

 They differ from Reptiles in — 



(1) Possession of feathers. 



(2) Complete circulation of warm blood. (In this, Birds agree with 

 Mammals.) 



The fact that Reptiles, as well as Birds, lay eggs, and that the nidi- 

 fication of some members of the two Classes is practically identical (e. 

 g. , the reptilian Crocodilia and avian Megapodidte (a group of Peri- 

 steropode Gallinse), is too well known to require more than mere men- 

 tion here; but the mammalian Monotremata also lay eggs, while 

 furthermore one of the latter {Ornitliorhynclms^ the duck mole of 

 Australia), possesses a very duck-like beak. 



KEY TO THE SUBCLASSES OF AVES. 



<'. Metacarpals separate, the first finger with 2, the second and third each with 3,

The Subclass SaururtB (Archgeornithes of Gadow) is represented 

 only by the extinct (Upper Jurassic) ArcJimopteryx; all existing birds 

 belonging to the Ornithurse (Neornithes of Gadow). 



The construction of a "key" to the orders and other supergeneric 

 groups of the Subclass Ornithurse, which shall serve for ready identi- 

 fication and at the same time express the mutual relationships and com- 

 parative taxonomic value of the different groups, has been found a 

 most difficult task. When the highest authorities disagree, as they

do, concerning the position or rank of certain fox'ms, it of course 

 becomes necessary to consider carefully the points of disagreement, to 

 weigh impartiallj' the evidence and arguments adduced by the advocates 

 of such divergent decisions, and, if possible, decide independentlj^ as 

 to the seemingly better allocation of the form in question. This has 

 been attempted in the following scheme, but the author is fully con- 

 scious that his disposition of such doubtful cases may still not be final, 

 especially when different from previous decisions, as in a few cases 

 has been the result of his revision. 



It is unfortunate that those who possess the most thorough knowl- 

 edge of avian anatom}^ and morphology do not always seem to have 

 succeeded in satisfactorily diagnosing the groups which they adopt, 

 nor in clearly presenting a synthetic summary of the facts revealed 

 through their investigations. So-called diagnoses are sometimes 

 found, when carefully analyzed, to be really not diagnostic at all; 

 more often thej'' prove to be so in part only. A by no means extreme 

 example, the case of the Limicolse and Lari (suborders of the Order 

 Charadriiformes), as defined in Gadow's Classification of Vertebrata 

 (1898, p. 35), may be given for illustration. These two groups are 

 thus characterized by Dr. Gadow: 



LimicoljE. — "Nidifugous, schizognathous, without spina interna 

 sterni; hypotarsus complicated." 



Laei. — ' 'Aquatic, schizognathous, vomer complete. Without basip- 

 terygoid processes. Front toes webbed; hallux small or absent. Large 

 supraorbital glands." 



Of the characters mentioned in these two diagnoses the following are 

 common to the two groups, and therefore are not diagnostic of either: 

 (1) Nidifugous young;' (2) schizognathism; (3) complete vomer; 

 (4) absence of spina interna sterni; (5) absence of basipterygoid proc- 

 esses;' (6) webbing of front toes;' (7) small or obsolete hallux; 

 (8) aquatic habits.* 



The difl'erential characters of the two groups are thus reduced to 

 the following: 



LiMicoLiE. — Hypotarsus complicated; supraorbital glands small. 



Laei. — Hypotarsus simple; supraorbital glands large. 



With this example of so-called Suborders which are characterized 

 by a verjr small number of relatively unimportant differences may be 

 contrasted that of the several subdivisions of the Order Gruiformes. 

 to which Dr. Gadow only allows family rank, although apparently far 

 better characterized than the so-called suborders of Charadriiformes, 



' The young of the Lari are not, it is true, strictly nidifugous, but they are often 

 more nearly so than nidicolous. 



'' Basipterygoid processes are present in some Limicohv, absent in others. 

 'The front toes are webbed in some Limicolje (e. g., Himantopus). 

 * The Phalaropes are quite as truly aquatic as Gulls.

Reverting to the order Charadriiformes, it may be stated that Dr. 

 Gadow recognizes four suborders (Limicolse, Lari, Pterocles, and 

 Columbse) as groups of equal value; nevertheless, that the Columbse 

 are far more different from the Limicolse or Lari than these two are 

 from one another is perfectly obvious from the evidence, which may 

 be summarized as follows: 



Limicol^-|-Laki. — Aquatic, limicoline, or cursorial; vomer well 

 developed; syrinx tracheo-bronchial ; cseca functional; young nidi- 

 fugous (or at least not strictly nidicolous) and ptilopsedic. 



CoLUMBJE. — Arboreal and terrestrial; vomer rudimentarjr or absent; 

 syrinx tracheal or sterno-tracheal; cajca nonfunctional; young nidi- 

 colous and gymnopgedic. 



^So far as I am able to ascertain, the essential anatomical differences between 

 Charadriiformes and Gruiformes, as constituted in Dr. Gadow' s scheme, are as follows: 



Chaeadriifoembs. — Dorsal vertebrae opisthocoelous; metastemum 4-notched. 



Geuifoemes. — Dorsal vertebrae heterocoelous; metastemum 2-notched or entire. 



^ The author is, of course, perfectly aware that groups are more often characterized 

 by combinations than by sets of absolutely exclusive characters; but in an analytical 

 "key" it becomes necessary to employ the latter, when they can be discovered, 

 without regard to their relative taxonomic value, otherwise the keys become com- 

 plicated and unmanageable. 




6 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



The Pterocletes agi-ee with the Columbge in rudimentary vomer; with 

 Laro-Limicolse in tracheo-bronchial syrinx, functional cseca, and nidi- 

 fugous, ptilopasdic j^oung; but thej^ possess so many characters not 

 shared by either of the other two groups that it is diiBcult to under- 

 stand whj^ they should- not constitute a group equal in taxonomic rank 

 with that composed of the Limicolse and Lari together.' 



It is chiefly in matters of this kind wherein the arrangement shown 

 in the following key to the higher groups of Ornithurse differs from 

 Dr. Gadow's latest scheme,^ which in the main appears so satisfactory 

 that no deviation from it seems called for. Among the difficulties con- 

 nected with its preparation perhaps the greatest arises from the fact 

 that in most cases groups have been defined by characters not mentioned 

 in the diagnoses of allied groups, thus necessitating a laborious tabula- 

 tion of characters gleaned from all available sources, and rendering 

 the sifting and weighing of evidence extremely difficult and perplexing. 



Nothing original is claimed for the classification here given, except 

 as to the form in which it is presented. It is simply the result of an 

 elective process, the evidently good of other systems being retained 

 and the obviously bad rejected, according to the author's ability 

 to correctly interpret the evidence." 



'In the Systematischer Thiel of Bronn's Thier-Reichs. V6gel (1893, pp. 195, 207), 

 Dr. Gadow divides the Order Oharadriiformes into two series — I, Verband der JLaro- 

 Limicolx, and II, Verband der Pteroclo-Columhx; but this subdivision is abandoned 

 in his later work. 



^The "Suborders" of Dr. Gadow's scheme are, however, in the following one 

 raised to the rank of Orders. This may seem unadvisable if, indeed, not entirely 

 unwarranted from the standpoint of comparative anatomy alone; but it must be 

 evident to most ornithologists that in the Class Aves' a different standard of value 

 must be given to the groups from that of other classes of Vertebrates, for, notwith- 

 standing the peculiar uniformity of fundamental structure among birds, the variations 

 of type are certainly not less numerous than in other classes of Vertebrates. As Dr. 

 Gadow truly remarks (Classification of Vertebrata, pp. vi, vii), "Each class has 

 * * * its own standard units, just as one nation reckons with £, s., d., another 

 with dollars and cents, and a third with marks and pfennigs, which again are not 

 the same as francs and centimes," and "it is obvious that a class which consists of 

 more than 10,000 recent species may call for more subdividing than one which com- 

 prises scarcely one-third of that number." 



' The works which have been most frequently consulted in the preparation of the 

 following " Key to the Orders of the Class Aves," as well as in connection with the 

 higher groups in general, are the following:

The Orders being based on anatomical characters, and some of them

 be remarked, included only the Crypturiformes. 



° A few exceptions to the use of the wings for flight are exemplified, in addition to 

 the case of Stringops, already mentioned, in certain large aquatic birds, as the now 

 extinct Great Auk (Flauttis impennis, a member of the Charadriiformes) and Pallas's 

 Cormorant {Pkalacrooora.r pcrxpiciUatus, belonging to the Ciconiiformes); and, among 

 existing birds, the large cormorant of the Galapagos Archipelago (Phalaa-ocorax 

 harrisi) and adults of the Steamer Duck ( Tachyeres cinereus, of the Anseriformes) of the 

 Straits of Magellan. In all these, however, the wings, although normally feathered, 

 are much too small in proportion to admit of flight, their principal function being for 

 propulsion beneath the surface of the water, as in the case of the penguins (Sphenisci- 

 formes) and most diving birds, including even the Passerine genus Cinclus.

 sisting of a single row, immediately behind the last row of lesser 

 coverts, of larger feathers, most of which overlap proximally — that 

 is, have the outer web of one feather covered by the inner web of 

 the one next to it; (3) greater coverts, consisting of still larger and

 basal half of the secondary remiges. Rectrices usually 12 (rarely 10

Nearly seven thousand species and subspecies,* or more ttian one-naif 

 of all existing birds, belong to the Order Passeriformes. Notwith- 

 standing this enormous number of specific forms, however, the type of 

 structure is remarkably uniform, and the group far more homogeneous 

 than the lower gi;oups of equal rank. Consequently, subdivision of 

 the Passeriformes becomes a matter of extreme difBculty, and no 

 arrangement has thus far been proposed which can be considered 

 entirely satisfactory. Indeed, it seems impossible to subdivide the 

 order, beyond a very limited extent, into lesser groups which are 

 equivalent in taxonomic rank to the families of other orders, and the 

 extent to which this may be done is a matter concerning which S3'stem- 

 atists differ widelj^ in their views. 



The latest authority on the classification of birds" allows but three 

 families of Passeriformes, while in the Catalogue of Birds in the British 

 Museum no less than forty-one are recognized. Surely between these 

 extremes there is ample room for difference of opinion and variety' of

treatment! It ma}' be, and doubtless is, perfectly true that no more 

 than threo Passeriform groups can be defined which will be equal in 

 taxonomio rank to the families of other orders of birds; but the objection 

 to this meager allowance — and it is a Verj' serious one — is that two of 

 the three groups contain together only about one-fifth the total num- 

 ber of species, so that there are still left about five thousand species in 

 the third. Obviously, these five thousand species (more or less) must 

 be susceptible of segregation into a considera))le number of more or 

 less trenchant groups; and there being so few grades of rank between 

 a family and a genus, what to call these groups becomes a verj' serious 

 question. The ordinary terminology of zoology evidently will not 

 sufiice; and if no more than three families of Passeriformes are recog- 

 nized, a new and complicated nomenclature for the intermediate groups 

 becomes necessary. 



As a provisional expedient, I propose to call the Passerine ''families" 

 of Gadow ^' svperf(t)nil-ies,''' and retain the former term for such groups 

 of genera as can be trenchantly separated from all others. Whether 

 this action will necessitate a reduction or an increase in the number of 

 so-called families over that generallj^ accepted can only be determined 

 after careful and thorough studj^ of the entire order. This is a task 

 for which the author of this work is unprepared, either as to time or 

 material. The best that he can do here is to limit investigation in this 

 direction to the American forms. Of course the result of such limited 

 research can not be entirely satisfactory; but it may serve to show, 

 perhaps more clearly than has been done before, which currently recog- 

 nized families can and which can not be characterized. Nothing is 

 more certain than that the commonly accepted limits of some of the 

 so-called families of the Superfamily Oscines are purely artificial and 

 arbitrary. On the other hand, it is equally obvious that some groups 

 to which family rank seems due have been ignored or overlooked. 

 Until more is known concerning the internal structure of various forms 

 any classification of the Oscines mu^t be considered imperfect and 

 provisional.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 15 



In Dr. Gadow's latest classification of birds (Bronn's Their-Reichs, 

 Vogel, ii, Systematischer Theil, 1893, pp. 299-302; Classification of 

 Vertebrata, 1898, pp. 37, 38) the main divisions of the Passeriformes 

 are somewhat difl^erent, the order being- divided into two suborders, 

 as above, but with different limits: Passeriformes ani.somyodi, with 

 groups Subclamatores ( = Desmodactyli) and Clamatores; and Passeri- 

 formes diacromyodi, with groups Suboscines (=Pseudoscine8) and 

 Oscines. (See also Newton's Dictionary of Birds, Introduction, p. 

 105.) It will thus be seen that instead of making a primary division 

 of the Desmodactyli, as opposed to all the remaining Passeriformes, 

 Dr. Gadow draws the line more nearly through the middle of the 

 order, with Desmodactyli (his Subclamatores) and the Clamatores on one 

 side and the diacromyodian Eleutherodactyli (Oscines and Pseudoscines) 

 on the other. This arrangement of Dr. Gadow's appears to be based 

 mainly, if not entirely, upon differences in the arrangement of the 

 vocal muscles, as follows: 



a. Syringeal rtiuscles "unequally inserted, either in the middle or upon only one or 



the other, dorsal or ventral, end of the [bronchial] semirings" Anisomyodi. 



aa. Syringeal muscles "attached to the dorsal and some to the ventral ends [of the 

 bronchial semirings] , those ends being, so to say, equally treated." 



Diacromyodi. 



In the arrangement of the syringeal muscles the Desmodactyli there- 

 fore agree with the Clamatores, these two groups constituting the 

 Anisomyodi of Gadow. While hesitating long to commit myself in 

 opposition to so learned and distinguished an authority, I nevertheless 

 can not, in the absence of other reasons in support of Dr. Gadow's 

 views (and none appear to have been adduced), believe that this agree- 

 ment between the Eurylaimidse and the Clamatores outweighs the differ- 

 ences set forth above, which trenchantly separate the former not only 

 from the Clamatores but from all other Passeriformes — the more 

 especially so since such disposition of the Eurj'laimidifi does not affect 

 the classification of the remaining members of the order on the lines 

 drawn by Dr. Gadow. 



The Suborder Desmodactyli' has no representation in America. It 

 is a small group (of about a dozen species and five genera) confined to 

 the Indo-Alalayan region, where it takes the place of the rather closely 

 related haploophone Clamatores (especially the famil}^ Cotingidse) of 

 the Neotropical region.

 follows:

Of these superfamilies the second (Pseudoscines) is represented only 

 in Australia. It is a very limited group, consisting of only two fam- 

 ilies, Menuridge (lyre-birds) and Atrichornithidse (scrub-birds), each 

 with only a single genus and very few species. The other two are 

 well represented in the Western Hemisphere, the Clamatores being 

 chiefly American. Further consideration of the last-named group 

 must be deferred until after the Oscines have been disposed of. The 

 latter, containing as thej' do much the greater number of passerine 

 birds (approximate^ 5,000 species and subspecies), and representing a 

 very uniform type of structure, offer by far the greatest difiiculties 

 to the systematist of any portion of the entire class of birds. The fol- 

 lowing arrangement of the so-called familiesis by no means supposed' 

 by the author to be an entirely satisfactory one, and none that can not 

 in some respect be criticised will be possible until the anatomy of a 

 far greater number of forms has been exhaustively investigated and 

 the results carefully analyzed and tabulated.

No classification of the Oscines has hitherto been proposed that will 

 stand a careful test with reference to the number and limits of the so- 

 called family groups or the characters upon which they are based; 

 nor can the present author say, after weeks of patient, persistent, and 

 at times hopeful effort, that he has been able to solve the problem. 



The following arrangement is presented as provisional only, as, 

 indeed, every scheme must necessarily be until the anatomy of numer- 

 ous ^ forms whose internal .structure is now unknown shall have been 

 carefully investigated. It maj' be observed that certain somewhat 

 radical innovations have been introduced in the waj^ of additional 

 " families " and changes to the limits of some of those currentlj- recog- 

 nized; but these innovations seem unavoidable if any advance is to be 

 made, for if anything has been made clear by the author's recent 

 study of the subject it is that improvement is possible only by greater 

 or less radical departure from stereotyped lines, which draw arbitrary 

 limits to many of the so-called family groups, thereby rendering them 

 palpably artificial, genera which obviously belong to one group being 

 often assigned to another, while other groups are made too compre- 



^It is unfortunate that no better vernacular name for this group of Passerine birds 

 has been invented or seems available. The term is certainly both inappropriate and 

 misleading, since by no means all Oscines are songsters (some of them, in fact, being 

 almost voiceless, e. g.,AmpeHs), while the Pseudoscines and many of the Clamatorea 

 are as much gifted with musical ability as the average oscinine songster. 



^In reality the vast majority of genera since those which have been thus studied 

 are comparatively few in number.

hensive by the inclusion of forms so "abeiTant" as to complicate any 

 diagnosis of the group and obscure its true characters. 



Excepting the Hirundinidse and Alaudidse, both of which are sharply 

 cut off from all other Oscines by most obvious external characters, no 

 group of Oscines can be considered as very trenchant unless such rad- 

 ical treatment as is here given be applied. Allowed their commonly 

 accepted limits, their intelligible definition is in some cases (e. g., the 

 Fringillidse, Tanagridae, Coerebidae, Mnlotiltidse, and "Ampelidse" 

 (=Ampelidfe + Ptiliogonatidse + Dulidse) simply impossible; but by 

 reconstructing the limits of these groups a fairh^ rational diagnosis of 

 each may be accomplished. It is not unlikely that several genera may 

 yet have to be withdrawn from the families in which they are now 

 placed and raised to independent family rank,^ examples being Phai- 

 nojJtila (here, as heretofore, associated with Ptiliogonys and Phainope- 

 pla), Poliojptila (usually placed in the Sylviidse, where it certainly does 

 not belong, and here provisionally referred to the Mimidse), Cdbypto- 

 philms, and Rhodinocichla, the last being here provisionally referred 

 to the Mnlotiltidse. ^ 



KEY TO THE FAMILIES OF OSCINES. 



a. Tarsus sharply ridged posteriorly, the ridge coinciding with the posterior median 

 line, or else outside the latter; inner posterior edge of acrotarsium coinciding 

 with the lateral median line or anterior to it, and at least as far separated 

 from the posterior ridge of the planta tarsi as is the outer posterior edge of the 

 acrotarsium; planta tarsi usually undivided.' (Acutiplantar Oscines.*) 



^ It is of course to be understood that by family rant the Oscinine standard only is 

 meant. 



' Calyptophilus has been considered a member of the Tanagridse, and placed next to 

 Phsenicophilus, but being a ' ' ten-primaried ' ' bird it certainly does not belong there. 

 Rhodinocichla was first described as a member of the Clamatorial family Furnariidse, 

 but, after its Oscinine character had been demonstrated, was placed by some author- 

 ities among the Mimidfe, by others among the Troglodytidte; both these groups, how- 

 ever, belong to the "ten-primaried" section of the Oscines, while Rhodinocichla is 

 typically "nine-primaried," and therefore, being obviously out of place in either of 

 these groups, must be otherwise disposed of. 



'A notable exception to the usual undivided planta tarsi in this section is seen in 

 the genus Salpinctes (Troglodytidre), in which the planta tarsi are more or less dis- 

 tinctly divided into transverse segments. Something of the same sort is seen in 

 most Corvidee, in which also the lateral plates of the planta tarsi are usually more or 

 less distinctly separated along the posterior ridge. In all these exceptional cases, 

 however, the posterior ridge of the planta tarsi is well defined and the tarsal envel- 

 ope as a whole very distinct in its character from that of the group {Latiplantar 

 Oscines) containing the Alaudidfe. 



*The terms Laminiplantar and Scutelliplantar, commonly adopted from Sundevall, 

 are rejected by me because these terms are misleading, some " Laminiplantares" 

 (e. g., Salpinctes, Corvida;, part) having scutellate planta tarsi, while the Alaudidse 

 (forming part of Sundevall's SciileUiplaniares) sometimes (in very old birds) have 

 the planta tarsi entire or "booted;" furthermore, the latter group included, besides 

 the Alaudidse, the superfamily Clamatores.

 bly the latter should be referred to the Crerebidse, but if so it is difficult to see why 

 Compsothlypis should not go with it. I would also eliminate from the Coerebidas part 

 of the genus Dacnis, transferring D. pulcherrima to the Tanagridse (as a new genus, 

 Iridophanes) and the Atelodacnis section to the Mniotiltidse, near Compsothlypis, Hel- 

 minikophila, etc. Whether such disposition of these forms is really the proper one 

 can only be determined by study of their anatomy; but unless this course be adopted 

 it is, apparently, impossible to intelligibly characterize the Ccerebidse and Mniotil- 

 tidfe as distinct groups, which undoubtedly they are if properly circumscribed. 



^ Certain genera of Coerebidse are distinguished from all Mniotiltine genera whose 

 osteology has been studied by the following characters: 



Coerebidse. — Interpalatine process small or abortive; transpalatine process slender, 

 spine-like; palatines produced posteriorly and overhanging anterior ends of ptery- 

 goids; tongue slender, with terminal portion extensively bifid or trifid, and brushy 

 or laciniate. 



Mniotiltidse. — Interpalatine process well developed; transpalatine process short and 

 bluntly angular; palatines not produced posteriorly over pterygoids; tongue shorter, 

 broader, with terminal portion but slightly cleft or brushy. 



The above distinctions hold good between Cosrcia, Cyanerpes, and Glossiplila (CcBre- 

 bidfe) on the one hand and Dendroica, " Perissoglossa ," Geothlypis, Compsothlypis, and 

 Certhidea (Mniotiltidse) on the other. (See Lucas, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xvii, 1894, 

 299-310.) The supposedly Coerebine genera Chlorophanes, Oreoinanes, Hemidacnis, 

 Dacni-i, Atelodacnis, and Conirostrum have not been examined anatomically, and until 

 these have been investigated, together with the supposedly JIniotiltine genus 

 Oreothlypis and Tanagrine genera Iridophanes (type, Dacnis pulcherrima Sclater), 

 Hemithraupis, and Chlorochrysa-, the line separating the Coerebidse from the Mniotil- 

 tidse on the one side and from the Tanagridaj on the other can not be considered as 

 established.

' Considerable care is necessary to determine whether the outermost obvious pri- 

 mary is the ninth or tenth, since in case the latter is rudimentary, though exposed, 

 it may easily be overlooked. The present section includes all forms in which there 

 is a visible rudimentary primary, those of the first section having the tenth primary 

 still more rudimentary and entirely concealed. In so-called ten-primaried birds in 

 which the tenth primary is rudimentary it consists of a minute, narrow, and pointed 

 quill, less than half as long as the primary coverts, lying upon the inner side of the 

 basal portion of the outer web of the outermost large primary, whereas in all so- 

 called nine-primaried Oscines it is still more minute and lies upon the outer side 

 of the wing next to the outermost primary covert. (See Baikd, Review of American 

 Birds, p. 325, footnote. ) 



^ Reference of the genus Phainopiila to the Ptiliogonatidae complicates the diagnosis 

 'of this group, which otherwise would be very easily characterized; but unless Phai- 

 nopiila is placed with the Ptiliogonatidse it must constitute a family by itself. So far 

 as the adult is concerned, there is nothing in its external structure that I can dis- 

 cover which would forbid its reference to the Turdidse (subfamily Myadestinse), 

 without materially modifying the diagnosis of the latter; but the young are abso- 

 lutely plain-colored, have the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate, and the tenth pri- 

 mary half as long as the ninth.

 in proportions of primaries, etc. ) breaking down when all the genera are compared.

 great that its diagnosis is very difficult.

 missure distinctly' and more or less abruptly angulated or deflexed 

 basally, or else with the mandibular rami less than one-fifth as long as 

 gonys, the mandibular tomium distinctly elevated (often angulated, 

 sometimes toothed) post-medially, thence distinctly (usually abruptly) 

 deflected to the rictus; rictal bristles obvious, usually distinct. 



The above brief and in many respects unsatisfactory diagnosis cov- 

 ers the extreme variations in certain external structural details among 

 a very large assemblage of species arbitrarily considered as forming 

 a family Fringillidfe. As here limited the family includes the whole 

 of the Fringillidse as treated bv Dr. Sharpe in the twelfth volume of 

 the Catalogue of the Birds in the British Museum ^ (the latest author- 

 ity on thegroup), onlj^ the genus Catmi'ibylyrh.ynclms being withdrawn,' 

 with the addition of the genera Pyrrhocoma, Pezopetes, Buarremon,*^ 

 ArreriKm, Diucopis. Cofiot/iraup/i^, 0/vothraupis (?), Saltator, and 

 '''' Pitylvf:"^ which Dr. Sclater, in the eleventh volume of the same 

 work" (and elsewhere), has placed among the Tanagridse. 



The group most closely related to the Fringillidae is, of course, that 

 called Tanagridse, or at least certain members of the latter, which pos- 

 sibly is, even after the above-mentioned eliminations, too comprehen- 



' Four vernacular names belong exclusively or specially to this family as a whole 

 or in part, and from these I have selected the one which seems to be most appro- 

 priate, although it is difficult to decide between /nc/i and sparrow. The fact is that 

 each of these names really has a restricted applicability, being commonly applied to 

 minor though more or leas arbitrary groups, and based on the comparatively scant 

 European fringilline fauna. They are therefore of still more limited applicability to 

 America forms, of which a great majority are very different from those of Europe, 

 and without any distinctive name. The term grosbeak can scarcely be considered in 

 this connection, having been applied indiscriminately to heavy-billed forms with- 

 eut regard to their real relationship to one another, not only crass-billed Fringillidse 

 but also Ploceidae having been thus designated.

sive and therefore may require still further restriction. As commonly 

 understood and accepted, the two supposed families are clearly purely 

 artificial, and the arbitrary line that has usually been drawn between 

 them is manifestly far out of place, the Tanagridw having been made 

 to include forms (those mentioned above') which are unquestionably 

 fringilline in their relationships. 



In the absence of any knowledge concerning the internal structure 

 of a large proportion of the genera comprised in the two groups any 

 dividing line must necessarily be more or less arbitrary; but I feel 

 sure that by shifting its position as hei'e indicated the tw(j groups 

 become much more natural, since they are now susceptible of fairly 

 definite characterization, whereas until this was done their intelligi- 

 ble diagnosis was simplj^ impossible. I am not at all sure but that 

 still further subdivision, at least of the Tanagridse, would better 

 express the facts of relationship, since even now, with their respective 

 limits certainly more correctly drawn, each of the two groups contains 

 forms extremely different in their general appearance, structural 

 details, and habits.'' However, this question as to whether the Frin- 

 gillidae and Tanagridae are reallj^ distinct family groups or not, and if 

 they are, where the line between them should be drawn, is one which 

 can not now be exactly determined. 



While, as above stated, the reference of the genera Buarreinon^ 

 Arremon, Pxtyliis^ and Saltator to the Fringillidae renders possible an 

 intelligible diagnosis of the two supposed families, it does not in the 

 least lessen the difficulty of defining the genera or of arranging them 

 into definite subordinate groups. This is indeed a matter so extremely 

 difficult that after repeated, patient, determined, and prolonged 

 attempts I must confess my inability to solve the problem. It is 

 very evident, according to mj^ judgment, that Dr. Sharpe's so-called 

 subfamilies, Coccothraustinse, Fringillinse, and Emberizinse, are 

 unnatural groups, especially the first; certainly Geospiza, Guiraca, 

 Spermojahila, Cardinalis, etc., are not at all closely related to Cocco- 

 thraitstes, Ilesjaeriphona, JEophona, Pyciiorhamphus, and Mycerobas, 

 which together form a very distinct group, though evidentlj^ closely 

 related to, if not directly connected with, the group which Dr. Sharpe 

 designates as his " Subfamily Fringillinse." The latter is another very 



^The only reasonable doubt pertains to the genera " Pitylus" and Saltator. 



^Compare the heavily built, crass-billed, short-legged, and arboreal true grosbeaks 

 (Coccothraustese) with the slender, small-billed, long-legged, and terrestrial grass 

 buntings (genera ^-Immotiramus, Passerculus, etc) on the one hand, and the broad- 

 billed, short-tailed, and long-winged frugivorous Euphonire (genera Euphonia and 

 Chlorophonia) with the slender-billed, long-tailed, insectivorous genera Tachyphorms, 

 Nemosia, etc., on the other.

natural and fairly well characterized group if the genera Acanthidops 

 and Sicalis be taken out' and Chloris and ChaunoproGtus added. ^ 

 Indeed these two groups (i. e., the " CoccothraustinsB " and "Fringil- 

 linse " as properly linaited) together eome very near being trenchantly 

 separated from all other Fringillidae; but the genus Passerina seems 

 to connect them, the latter being in all respects (as to external charac- 

 ters) except the shape of the bill like Leucosticte (a typical "fringil- 

 line" form), while the bill is very similar to that of a typical Eynbe- 

 riza. All of the forms comprising the above-mentioned groups are of 

 northern distribution (many of the genera being circumpolar), only the 

 genus Spiniis extending into the Neotropical Region proper, excepting 

 its near relation, Loximitris, confined to one of the Greater Antilles. 



These northern groups present little difficulty, except as to the 

 determination of the question whether they should be regarded as 

 constituting one large group distinct from all other Fringillidse or as 

 comprising a greater or less number of smaller grotips, of equal value 

 with similar groups in the larger assemblage of purely American 

 forms to be considered separately. Although -unable to fully satisfy 

 myself as to which course would be best, I have, for the present, con- 

 cluded to adopt the latter alternative; and, therefore, instead of recog' 

 nizing two groups, equivalent to Dr. Sharpe's Coccothraustinse and 

 Fringillinffi, as amended, or one group including the two, four groups, 

 Coccothraustese, Loxise, Pyrrhulse, and Fringillse, are provisionally 

 adopted. 



These coccothraustine and f ringilline types having thus been tempo- 

 rarily disposed of, there remains the very numerous assemblage of 

 peculiarljr American ^ genera. These, with the exception of the group 

 which 1 have here named Calcarieee (comprising the genera Passerhia, 

 C'alcarius, and RhyncJwphanes^ which are evidently related to Pala;- 

 arctic types *), are all peculiar to America (mostly to the Neotropical 

 Region) and with few exceptions not at all like any Old World types. 

 It is this group which presents the greatest difficulties in the way of 

 satisfactory classification. Not only do the different groups (or what 

 seem to be natural groups) run into one another in a most perplexing 



' Aavnthidops is certainly not a member of the Fringillinse, its nearest relation being 

 undoubtedly the "emberizine" genus Haplospiza. I am reasonably sure that S'caWs 

 also is an "emberizine" form (related to Haplospiza, Pseudochloris, etc.), notwith- 

 standing the remarkable superficial resemblance of some of the species to the truly 

 fringilline genus Si'rI.nus. 



'' Chaunoproctus seems to be a crass-billed Carpodamx, an approach to its characters 

 being seen in the insular Carpodaciis dmplus.

 the three known species are peculiar to the Nearctic Region.

manner, but the genera themselves are often poorly defined (e. g. , Aimo- 

 pMla), or when thej^ seem clearly natural it is found on close compar- 

 ison of the component species that they present such great variations 

 in structural details (e. g. , Oyanospiza, Cyanocompsa, etc.) that the fram- 

 ing of a satisfactory diagnosis is by no means an easy matter. Certain 

 members of this extensive series of genera present a close superficial 

 resemblance to the Coccothraustese in fact, they are "grosbeaks" so 

 far as the large size of the bill is concerned, though not otherwise, for 

 there is very great difference in the form of the beak between such 

 genera as Pheucticus, Zamelodia, Geospiza, Orysoborus, Cardinalis, 

 etc. , and that of liesperiphona, Goccothraustes, etc. , not to mention rad- 

 ical differences in other respects. 



Notwithstanding the immense difference in appearance, structural 

 details, and habits between different minor groups of this assemblage 

 of American types, I have failed to discover characters whereby verj^ 

 trenchant groups may be defined. Four genera [Oalamospiza, Spiza, 

 CJumdestes, and Pooecetes, all Nearctic) do not fit into any of the 

 groups that seem susceptible of more or less exact definition, nor do 

 they constitute a group by themselves. Leaving them out of account, 

 the remaining genera may be rather roughly and arbitrarily separ- 

 ated into two series; one composed of the smaller billed and more 

 plainly colored (usually conspicuously streaked ^) species, and repre- 

 sented by the genera Passerculus, Gentronyx, GoPurnicuhis, Amino- 

 dramus, Plagiospiza, Aiinophila, Amphispiza, Junco, . Sjnzella, 

 Zonotriohia, Brachyspiza, Melospiza, Passerella, Oreospiza, Pipilo^ 

 Melozone, Arremonops, Arremon, Lysurus, Atlapetes, Buarremon, 

 Pselliophorus, and Pezopetes; the other comprising the larger billed 

 or more brightly colored forms, or those with more uniform colors, 

 the genera being Platysptza, Gam.arhynchus, Geospiza, Gocornis^ 

 Acanthidops, Ilaplospiza, Volatinia, Euetheia, Melarwspiza^Loxipasser, 

 Pyrrhulagra, Mdopyrrha, Sporophila, Amaurospiza, 8 i calls, Gyano- 

 ■spiza, Gyanocompsa, Oryzoborus, Guiraca, Zam,elodia, Pheucticus, Pyr- 

 rhuloxia, Gardinalis, Pitylus, Garyothraustes, Rhodotliraupis, and 

 Saltator^. While the characters given above as distinguishing these 

 two groups are artificial, even trivial, I feel convinced that when the 

 internal structure of all the genera becomes known the line of first 

 division will be drawn somewhere near that here indicated. 



Although an effort has been made in the following analytical key to 

 keep the component parts of the different groups together, it has been 

 found impracticable in some cases to arrange the groups in what seems 

 to be their most natural sequence; in fact, to do this in a linear arrange-

^ These peculiarities of the feet, while perfectly obvious on comparison, are very 

 difficult to express in exact terms, since they have defied all methods of measure- 

 ment which I have been able to apply. The toes appear to be relatively shorter or 

 with relatively shorter phalanges than in the forms which follow, but measurements 

 apparently do not confirm this impression.

'In all external structural characters except the bill, Passerina is very closely 

 similar to Leucostide, while in its style of plumage it greatly retembles the genus 

 Monti fringilla, a very near ally of Leucostide. Whether these very close resem- 

 blances to two unquestionable true finches (Fringillse) indicate real affinity or merely 

 adaptation to similar habits (all three inhabiting, during summer, cliffs and other 

 rocky places), I am unable to say. I believe, -however, that Passerina is really 

 a "finch," and not, as commonly supposed, a "bunting." Whether Calcarius and 

 Rhynchophanes (which are meadow birds) are really closely related to Passerina, I am 

 somewhat doubtful.

3 From here on the arrangement is mainly artificial, easy identification of the genera 

 being the chief aim. The genera are kept in what appear to be natural groups as far 

 as this has been found practicable, but I am compelled to acknowledge my inability to 

 clearly define all the groups that appear to be natural ones, and no effort is made to 

 arrange the genera or groups of genera in the sequence that seems to be most appro- 

 priate, and which is followed in the body of the work. (See footnote on page 28. )

 half or more, nearly straight basallj', where not abruptly deflexed; 

 mandibular tomium without subbasal angle, but gently arched, the 

 summit of the arch nearly midway between the base and tip. Wing 

 long (nearly five to more than five times as long as the short tarsus), 

 pointed (ninth, eighth, and seA'enth primaries longest, the ninth longer 

 than the sixth) ; primaries with normal tips, the longest exceeding the 

 secondaries by nearly twice the length of the tarsus. Tail short 

 (about three times as long as tarsus), emarginated, more than half 

 hidden by the upper coverts. Tarsus very short, little if sluj longer 

 than the culmen, about equal to middle toe and half its claw; lateral 

 toes short, their claws falling considerably short of base of middle 

 claw; hallux decidedly shorter that lateral toes, but much stouter. 



Colors. — Plumage rather compact; adult males largelj* yellow, the 

 wings and tail black, with innermost secondaries and greater wing- 

 coverts whitish; at least the crown and occiput black; females with 

 grayish, or yellowish gray, replacing the yellow; young not streaked.

 dai'ker. 



Adult mah'. — General color dull red (varying from dull brownish 

 scarlet or almost orange-chrome in summier to a hue more or less 

 approaching dragon's blood red in winter), the red brightest on rump, 

 dullest on back and scapulars, where the feathers have more or lews 

 distinct duskj' brownish centers; orbits, upper part of auricular 

 region, spot at posterior extremity of malar region and another on 

 each side of occiput dusky brownish, these markings not sharply 

 defined, sometimes indistinct, but always evident; middle of abdomen 

 more or less extensiA^ely light grajdsh; bill horn color, more dusky at 

 tips; iris brown; legs and feet dusky brownish; length (skins), 128. 27-

 (10.16); tarsus, 14.73-18.29(16.51); middle toe, 12.70-15.49 (13.72).^ 



Adult female. — The red of the adult male replaced by grayish olive 

 or olive-grayish more or less extensivelj^ overlaid by bright yellowish 

 olive or dull saffron yellow, this brighter color always evident on 

 rimip and sometimes prevalent over under parts (except abdomen and 

 under tail-coverts); wings and tail less dark, more grajdsh dusky; 

 length (skins), 125.22-153.92 (128.27); wing, 78.74-90.68 (85.09); tail,

 Considering the very great extent of country inhabited exclusively by this small 

 form, the considerable variations of size and coloration observable seem to be purely 

 individual and not at all correlated with difference of locality. The following aver- 

 age measurements of several series, grouped according to locality, will serve to show 

 that there is certainly no material variation of size according to latitude:

Eastern and central Siberia, west to valley of the Yenesei and south, 

 in winter, to Turkestan; accidental in Alaska (Nulato, Yukon Eiver, 

 one specimen, January 10, 1867). 



Pyrrhula rubicilla {not Loria rubicilla Guldenstadt) Pallas, Zoogr. Rosso- Asiat. , 

 ii, 1826, 7 (female, part). 



^Itia possible that one of the two European forms occurs, or has occurred, acci- 

 dentally in northeastern North America. In Bulletin No. 15 of the U. S.^ National 

 Museum, 1879, p. 74, Mr. Ludwig Kumlien mentions that a bullfinch (recorded as 

 "Pyrrhula ?") was seen by him July 19, 1879, near Oosooadluin Harbor, Cum- 

 berland Sound, which he was sure was a bird of this genus. 



2 One specimen. No. 100223, U.S.N.M, Kutluk, Lake Baikal, Siberia, March 2, 188?.

Genus PINICOLA Vieillot. 



Pinicola Vieillot, Ois. Am., Sept., i, 1807, p. iv. (Type, P. ?-u6ro yieUlot,= 

 Loxia enucleator Linnaeus. ) 



SlrobUophaga Vieillot, Analyse, 1816, 29. (Type, Dur-Bec B\ifion,= Loxia enu- 

 cleator Linnaeus.) 



"Strobiliphaga Boie." 



Corythus Cuvier, RSgne Anim., i, 1817, 301. (Type, Loxia enucleator Linnseas.) 



Enucleator Brehm, Vogelf., 1855, 89. (Type, Loxia enucleator Linnaeus.) 



"Bensirostra Wood" (Gray, Gen. Birds, 1855, 81). 



Very large (more than 177 mm. long) arboreal finches with long wings 

 and tail; very short, broad, and thick bill with culmen strongly curved 

 and tip of maxilla hooked, and small feet; the plumage mostly plain, 

 without streaks or spots on under parts; the adult males in full plum- 

 age more or less red. 



Bill short, broad, and thick, with the culmen strongly convex from 

 the base, its width at the base nearly, equal to the distance from the 

 nostril to the tip of the maxilla; width of mandible at base little if any 

 greater than length of gonys, the latter nearly sti'aight, with the basal 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 59 



angle very prominent; maxillary tomium gently concave basall}^ 

 strongly so terminally, mandibular tomium decidedly angulated pos- 

 terior to the middle, but the angle not toothed; nasal plumules con- 

 spicuous, quite hiding the nostrils; wing long (about five times as 

 long as the tarsus), rather pointed (four outermost primaries longest, 

 the ninth decidedly longer than the fifth) ; primaries exceeding second- 

 aries by more than li times the length of the tarsus but less than half 

 the length of the tail; tail long (shorter than wing by only about half 

 the length of the tarsus), emarginated; tarsus short, less than twice 

 as long as exposed culmen, nearly as long as middle toe with claw; 

 anterior claws very slightly curved, the lateral ones reaching beyond 

 base of middle claw; hallux shorter than the lateral toes, but much 

 stouter, the rather Aveak claw decidedly shorter than its digit. 



Goloration. — Adult males: General color dull rose pink or madder 

 pink (rarely varying to a light vermilion tint), changing to ash gray 

 on scapulars, flanks, belly, and under tail-coverts, the plumage every- 

 where being of this color beneath the surface; scapulars and feathers 

 of back dusky centrally, causing a spotted appearance; wings and tail 

 dusky, the middle and greater coverts broadly tipped with white (this 

 sometimes tinged with pink) and tertials broadly edged with same; 

 secondaries, primaries, and tail-feathers narrowly edged with light 

 grayish. Adult females with wings and tail as in the male, but rest 

 of plumage graj'ish, without any red, but changing to a more or less 

 bright olive-tawny tint on head and lower rump, the breast sometimes 

 tinged with same. Young similar to adult female, but colors duller 

 and more blended, the wing-bands dull buffy instead of pure white, 

 and texture of plumage very different. 



[Note. — Numerous apparently adult males have the plumage not 

 distinguishable from that of the female; in others, the general plumage 

 is that of the female, except that the olivaceous or tawny color on 

 head, etc. , is replaced by a more reddish tint (varying from light dull 

 orange-red to deep madder brown).] 



Range. — More northern parts of Palsearctic and Nearctic regions 

 (including Boreal "islands" southward).

Similar to P. e. canadensis in length of wing, tail, and tarsus, but 

 with much larger, relatively longer, and more .strongly hooked bill; 

 in size and shape of bill and in coloration more like P. e. enucleator, 

 but decidedlj^ lai'ger (except bill), the adult male with the red rather 

 brighter, especially on upper parts, the adult female and immature 

 male usually with much less of yellowish olive on breast and with 

 more of the same color on rump and upper tail-coverts.

Island of Kadiak, Alaska, and Alaskan coast southward, at least to 

 Sitka (probably also coast district of British Columbia, at least in

[Of all the American forms this is decidedly most like true P. enu- 

 deaior of Europe, having the bill almost precisely similar in size and 

 shape and the coloration very nearly the same. In general dimensions, 

 however, the present bird is decidedly larger, the average length of 

 wing, tail, and tarsus being practically the same as in P. e. canadensis. 

 In coloration the resemblance to P. e. e/iucleator is very close indeed, 

 the latter and P. e. flammula having the dusky centers to the feathers

 nately he neglected to name it.

of the back in adult males much less distinct than in P. e. canadensis 

 and its northwestern relative, P. e. alascensis. P. e. flammula is a 

 little more brightly colored than P. e. enudeator, however, or the red, 

 if not more intense, is of an appreciably purer hue. The female and 

 immature (?) male has, usually, much less of an olive-yellowish wash 

 on the breast, though the golden olive of the head and neck are brighter, 

 and there is much more of golden olive on the rump and upper tail- 

 coverts than in P. e. eniteleator. 



The much larger, stouter, and more hooked bill alone will serve to 

 readily distinguish this coast form from the two more southern moun- 

 tain forms, P. e. calif ornica and P. e. montana.]

 Hypolia Ridgway, Bull. U. S. Geol. and Geog. Surv. Terr., sec. ser., i, no. 2, May 



11, 1875, 67. (Type, Passer arctous Pallas.) 



Long-winged, short-legged, essentially terrestrial finches, with nor- 

 mally shaped bill (i. e. , with maxilla not distinctly shallower than man- 

 dible and with gonys decidedly more than half the lateral length of the 

 mandible), and dark-colored plumage. 



Bill much shorter than head, short-conical; distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla less than half the length of the tarsus, equal to or a little 

 more than depth of bill at base; culmen very slightly convex or nearly 

 straight to near the tip, where more convex; gonys straight, barely 

 shorter than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; lateral basal por- 

 tion of mandible sometimes with an oblique ridge. Nasal plumules 

 distinct, quite covering nostrils. Wing long (more than five times as 

 long as tarsus), pointed (three outermost primaries — usually the ninth — 

 longest) ; primaries exceeding secondaries by nearly or quite twice the 

 length of the tarsus. Tail about two-thirds as long as wing, or a little 

 more, emarginated, more than half hidden by the upper coverts. Tar- 

 sus equal to or slightly longer than middle toe with claw; lateral claws 

 reaching to about base of middle claw; hind claw equal to or longer 

 than its digit, strongly curved. 



Coloration. — Adults with more or less of pink or reddish, at least 

 on flanks, or else with remiges and rectrices silverj^ gray or whitish. 

 Young not streaked, but nearly unicolored, and wholly dark colored 

 (sooty, grayish, or brownish) beneath. 




68 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Range. — Colder parts of eastern and central Asia and western North 

 America. 



From this genus I exclude Montifringilla^ Brehm, on account of its 

 even tail, with broad-ended rectrices, and Fringillauda^ Hodgson, by- 

 reason of its longer tarsus (decidedly more, instead of less, than one- 

 fifth as long as wing), both genera being also very different from Leu- 

 costicte in their style of coloration. Both are exclusively Palsearctic.

Adult male in summer. — Forehead and part of crown black; nasal

 whole of occiput plain light ash gray, very strongly contrasted with 

 the contiguous brown color of the auriculars and hindneck;* whole side

 Hodgson. ) 



"The young are not sufficiently well known' to permit their introduction into the 

 key. I have seen only those of L. tephrocotis griseonucha and L. australis. 



*ln very much worn midsummer specimens, the black of the crown sometimes 

 runs backward to the brown of the hindneck, thus throwing the gray into two lateral 

 patches, which in some midsummer females are more indistinct. This, however, is 

 not a variation of the pattern, but the result of wearing away of the gray tips to the 

 feathers.

A series of summer birds from the White Mountains and Sierra Nevada of southern 

 California, in the collection of the Biological Survey, seems to be referable to true 

 L. Uphrocotis; at least I am not able, in the absence of a series of summer birds from 

 other localities, to detect any differences which are not probably due to difference of 

 season, all other specimens being winter and spring birds, chiefly the former. The 

 average measurements of these southern California birds and those of a still larger

 black (adult male) or dusky slate-brownish (adult female and immature 

 male). 



Adult male in summer. — Forehead and part of crown black; nasal 

 tufts white; sides of crown (over eyes and auriculars) and entire occiput 

 uniform light ash gray; auricular and malar regions, chin, throat, and 

 under parts generally brownish black or deep clove brown, the feathers 

 of the sides, flanks, and abdomen broadly tipped with peach-blossom 

 pink; under tail-coverts and anal region pink, more or less mixed with 

 white, the feathers more or less extensively grayish centrally; hind- 

 neck, back, and scapulars dark sepia brown, the feathers with more or 

 less distinct lighter brown or buffy edgings; rump peach -blossom pink, 

 the feathers gray basally, a dusky bar or space separating the gray 

 from the pink; upper taU-co verts similar, but the underlying darker 

 colors more exposed; lesser and middle wing-coverts peach -blossom 

 pink; greater coverts broadly edged with peach-blossom pink, the 

 concealed portion of the feathers dusky; primary coverts and remiges 

 dusky edged with pink; rectrices dusky edged with light grayish and 

 pink; bill, legs, and feet black. 



Adult male in winter. — Similar to the summer male, but bill yel- 

 lowish, tipped with dusky; light brown or buflfy edgings to scapulars 

 and interscapulars broader and more distinct; feathers of breast, etc., 

 more or less margined with light buflfy grayish, and the pink markings 

 of a softer, more rosy, hue. 




76 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Immature male. — Similar to adult male, but the pink marking^s paler, 

 replaced on middle and greater wing-coverts and part of secondaries 

 by broad tips and edgings of buffy white. 



Adult female. — Much duller in color than the male, the under parts

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMEKICA. 77 



LEUCOSTICTE AUSTRALIS (Allen). 

 BROWN-CAPPED LETJCOSTICTE. 



No distinct or clear gray markings on head/ 



Adult male in summer. — Pileum dusky grayish Drown, becoming 

 nearly or quite black on forehead; nasal tufts whitish; rest of head, 

 together with neck, chest, and breast, deep cinnamon-brown or dull rus- 

 set, deepest on throat, where often, as on chest and breastalso, tinged or 

 flecked with bright red; hindneck, back, and scapulars similar, but 

 duller (between wood brown and broccoli brown), with narrow, more 

 or less indistinct, shaft-streaks of dusky; feathers of rump and upper 

 tail-coverts broadly and abruptly tipped with peach-blossom pink; the 

 remaining portion of the feathers grayish brown, more dusky next to 

 the pink; sides, flanks, and abdomen mostly carmine-pink, the feathers 

 grayish brown beneath the surface; under tail-coverts deep grayish 

 brown or dusky centrally, broadly and abrupt^ margined with pink 

 and white; wings dusky, with lesser and middle coverts broadly 

 tipped with peach-blossom pink, the greater and primary coverts and 

 remiges edged with the same — the color very bright, almost scarlet, 

 on the wing-coverts in some midsummer specimens; tail dusky, edged 

 with pale brownish gray and pinkish; bill and feet black. 



Adult male in winter. — Similar to the summer male, but bill yellow- 

 ish, tipped with dusky; pileum light brownish gray posteriorly and 

 laterally, with dusky centers to feathers; dusky feathers of forehead 

 and crown margined with pale grayish brown, scapulars and interscap- 

 ulars conspicuously margined with pale buJffy brown; feathers of breast 

 and other anterior under parts margined with pale buffy, and the pink 

 markings and areas of a lighter and softer, more rose pink, hue. 



Immature m,ale. — Similar to adult males, as described above, but 

 greater wing-coverts edged with bufify (in winter) or dull whitish (in 

 summer). 



Adult female. — Much duller in color than adult male, but with the 

 same seasonal changes; breast, etc., wood brown; back, etc., more 

 grayish brown, and the pink markings indistinct. 



Young. — Plain light grayish buffy brown, including whole head, 

 much paler on posterior under parts; lesser and middle wing-coverts 

 and tail-coverts tipped with dull light buffy; greater wing-coverts 



^ In very fresh plumage there is a quite well defined area covering exactly the same 

 parts of the pileum as in L. tephrocoiis tephrocotis and L. atrata, that is differently colored 

 from the contiguous parts, but instead of this area being clear and perfectly uniform 

 light ash gray the feathers are dusky brownish gray centrally, margined with light 

 brownish gray, producing a more or less squamate or scale-like appearance; further- 

 more, the brown color whicn borders this somewhat grayish area is decidedly lighter 

 and duller, or less rufescent, than in L. tephrocotis.

Small, streaked, red-capped, and often rosy-breasted finches with 

 long and distinctly emarginate tail and small acute bill. 



Bill conical, strongly compressed terminally and usually acute at 

 tip, nearly the basal half (except in summer plumage) covered by the 

 conspicuous nasal plumules; culmen and gonys nearly straight, the 

 former always much shorter than the tarsus. Wing long (five times 

 as long as tarsus or more), pointed (three outermost primaries longest, 

 the ninth longer than the seventh); primaries exceeding secondaries by 

 nearly twice the length of the tarsus. Tail long (at least three-fourths 

 long as wing), deeply emarginate or forked. Tarsus very short — 

 about one-quarter as long as tail and not more than one-fifth as long 

 as wing, a little longer than middle toe with claw; lateral toes much 

 shorter than the middle, their long and strongly curved claws reaching 

 to about the middle of the middle claw; hallux nearly as long as outer 

 toe, its slender, slightly arched claw longer than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above streaked with dusky upon a brownish, grayish, 

 or whitish ground, the rump sometimes immaculate white or pinkish; 

 top of head bright red (except in A. hrewsterli) ; wings and tail duskj', 

 the feathers edged with paler, the middle and greater wing-coverts 

 tipped with whitish or pale brownish; superciliary region and lower 

 parts chiefly whitish, but anterior lower parts (except in A. irewsterii) 

 more or less tinged with red in adult males, and sides usually more or 

 less streaked with dusky; a more or less distinct dusky spot on chin 

 and upper part of throat (except in A. hrewsterii). 



Admit females. — Similar to the males but without any red on breast, 

 etc., the crown, however, red, as in male. 



Young. — No red whatever on crown or elsewhere; whole head 

 streaked with dusky and grayish or brownish white, the latter color 

 prevailing on under portions; otherwise much as in adult females, but 

 under parts more extensively streaked, plumage of much softer, more 

 "woolly," texture and markings less sharply defined. 



[Both sexes have in summer a blackish bill, the red of a brighter 

 tint, and the colors darker than in winter, during which season the bill 

 is yellow, tipped with black, the lighter markings more pronounced, 

 and the plumage in general more or less strongly suffused with buffy 

 or light ochraceous-brown.J 



Range. — Northern portions of Northern Hemisphere.

ACANTHIS LINARIA LINARIA (Linnaeus). 

 REDPOLL, 



About the size of A. hornemannii exilipes, but wing and tail (especially 

 the latter) averaging shorter, bill and toes decidedlj- longer, and colora- 

 tion much darker; the rump never white, and the under tail-coverts 

 always conspicuously streaked with dusky. 



Aokilt Triolein hreeding dress. — Forehead (narrowly) dusky; crown 

 bright poppy red; general color of remaining upper parts dark gray- 

 ish brown or sepia, indistinctly streaked with darker, and more or less 

 streaked with grayish white, especially on hindneck, lower back, and 

 median portion of upper back; rump mixed pink and grayish white, 

 broadly streaked with dusky; upper tail-coverts grayish brown edged 

 with paler; wings and tail dusky grayish brown, the remiges and 

 rectrices narrowly edged with pale brownish gray or dull grayish 

 white, the middle and greater wing-coverts narrowly tipped with 

 grayish white; chin and upper portion of throat dusky; cheeks, lower 

 throat, chest, and sides of breast deep peach-blossom pink, often tinged 

 with bright poppy red; rest of under parts white, the sides, flanks, 

 and under tail-coverts broadly streaked with dusky; bill horn color 

 basally, dusky at tip; legs and feet dusky brown or blackish. 



Adult male in winter plumage. — Much lighter colored than in sum- 

 mer, the prevailing color of back, scapulars, and hindneck light, more 

 or less buffy grayish brown, distinctly streaked with dusky; the lower 

 back and rump streaked with dusky and whitish (the latter often more 

 or less mixed with pink on lower rump) ; the wing-bands and lighter 

 edgings of remiges, etc., more or less inclining to buffy; the pink of 

 chest, etc., paler (rose pink), and the bill light yellow with black at 

 tip or along terminal portions of culmen and gonys. 



Adult female {and some apparently adult males). — Similar to the 

 male, but without any pink or red on the' under parts, the portions so 

 colored on the male being pale buffy or whitish; the seasonal differ- 

 ences exactly as in the adult male. 



Young. — No red on crown, the whole pileum being broadly streaked 

 with duskj'^ and pale grayish buffy; sides of throat, chest, and sides of 




86

breast buffy or dull buffj^ whitish, streaked with dusky; otherwise 

 much like adults, but wing-bands and edgings dull buffy, and back and 

 scapulars browner. 



[Young birds in first winter are like adults, but with upper parts 

 browner, and with head, etc. (whole anterior under parts in females), 

 more strongly tinged or suffused with buff.] 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 109.47-135.13 (123.44); wing, 70.61- 

 76.45 (74.93); tail, 48.51-58.17 (54.10); exposed culmen, 7.87-9.65 

 (8.89); depth of bill at base, 5.33-7.11 (6.10); tarsus, 13.46-15.76 

 (14.73); middle toe, 7.62-9.65 (8.64).' 



Adult female.— Length (skins), 108.97-138.18 (122.68); wing, 70.10- 

 76.20 (73.91); tail, 50.55-58.42 (53.85); exposed culmen, 7.62-9,65

 middle toe, 7.62-9.14 (8.38).' 



More northern portions of northern hemisphere, the northern limit 

 of its breeding range inosculating with the southern portion of the 

 breeding range of A. Juyrneniannii exilipes (Ungava to western Alaska); 

 breeding southward to islands in Gulf of St. Lawrence;' in winter 

 south to more northern United States generally, iri-egularly and more 

 rarely to Virginia (Alexandria Co.), northern Alabama (Stevenson), 

 southern Ohio (Hamilton Co.), southern Indiana (Franklin, Decatur,

The series of European specimens ia much too small to afford satisfactory compar- 

 ison with North American birds. They show certain differences of coloration, which 

 may or may not prove to be constant, and comparison with larger series is therefore 

 very desirable.

 between these two would be practically indistinguishable from ^1. I. holbcellii. Doubt- 

 less some of the specimens from the more eastern portions of North America are 

 really not true A. I. holbmllii, but with our present imperfect knowledge of the range 

 of the last it is scarcely possible to determine the question.

Somewhat like an immature female of A. linaria linaria, but with- 

 out any red on the crown or dusky on the chin, and with portions pi the 

 plumage tinged with sulphur yellow. 



Adult female {male unknown). — Above olive-brownish, streaked with 

 dusky, the rump tinged with pale sulphur yellow, beneath whitish, 

 faintly tinged with dull bufly or pale fulvous on chest, the sides and 

 lower tail-coverts streaked with dusky; wings with two pale fulvous 

 bands across tips of middle and greater coverts; primaries and rec- 

 trices narrowly edged with pale sulphur yellow; wing, 76.20; tail, 

 63.50;' tarsus, 12.70; middle^ toe, 7.62. 



This bird continues to be known only from the type specimen, taken 

 at Waltham, Massachusetts, November 1, 1870, having been shot from a 

 flock of A. linaria. Possibly it is a hybrid of Acanthis linaria and 

 Spinvs pinus.

Genus CARDUELIS Brisson. 

 Carduelis Bkisson, Orn., iii, 1760, 53. (Type., Fringilla carduelis Linn^us.) 



Small arboreal finches with elongate-conical, acute bill, long, pointed 

 wing, rather short, deeply emarginate tail, much yellow on wings, head 

 partlj^ red (in adults) and under parts white medially; sexes alike in 

 coloration. 



Bill elongate-conical, with the exposed portion of the very slightly 

 curved culmen nearlj' as long as the tarsus, and longer than the middle 

 toe (without claw), its basal depth decidedly less than the distance 

 from the nostril to the tip of the maxilla; gonys straight, its length 

 greater than depth of bill at base. Nasal plumules short, but quite 

 covering nostrils. Wing long (at least five times as long as tarsus), 

 pointed (three outermost primaries longest, the ninth sometimes 

 longest) ; primaries exceeding secondaries by about twice the length 

 of the exposed culmen. Tail narrow and rather short (less than two- 

 thirds as long as wing), deeply emarginate, more than half hidden by 

 upper coverts, the reotrices pointed, except middle pair. Tarsus short 

 (less than one-third as long as tail, a little longer than exposed culmen, 

 and about equal to middle toe with claw) ; outer claw reaching about 

 to base of middle claw, the inner claw falling a little short; hind claw 

 shorter than its digit. 



Colors. — White and graj', or white and brown, beneath, the mantle 

 brown or gray; wings and tail black, the former with yellow on greater 

 coverts and basal portion of outer webs of remiges, the latter with 

 white on inner webs of rectrices; adults with forepart of the head 

 (except lores) red, the under parts unspotted; young without red on the 

 head, the under parts more or less spotted with dusky. 



Range. — Palsearctic Region. (One species introduced into, and 

 partially naturalized in, northeastern United States.)

AdMlts {sexes alike).— Fore part of head, all round, crimson; lores, 

 hinder part of crown, occiput, nape, and bar from the latter halfway 

 across side of neck black; rest of head white, more or less tinged with 

 brownish buff; back, scapulars, and rump plain brown; upper tail- 

 coverts white; wings and tail mostly black; greater portion of greater 

 coverts, basal portion of outermost secondaries, and basal half or more 

 of exposed portion of outer webs of primaries bright lemon yellow; 

 secondaries, primaries, and middle rectrices tipped with white, the 

 inner webs of lateral rectrices also partly white; sides of bx'east, sides, 

 and flanks plain cinnamon-brown or wood brown; rest of under parts 

 white; bill whitish (tinged with flesh color or lilac in life); iris brown; 

 legs and feet dull flesh color (in life). 



Young. — Wings and tail- as in adults, but the former with middle 

 and greater coverts tipped with pale brownish, forming two bands; 

 no red on head nor black on head or neck; pileum and hindneck light 

 grayish brown, mottled or streaked with darker, the back also more

magellanica Vieillot. ) 

 Melanomitris Cassin, Proo. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila., xvii, 1865, 91. (Type, Carduelis 



atratus Lafresnaye and D'Orbigny. ) 



Small arboreal finches, with small or moderate-sized conical acute 

 bill, long, pointed wings, rather short, eiaarginate tail, short tarsi, 

 and with the plumage mainly black and yellow (sometimes olive-green 

 above and yellowish below in adult females and young), in one species 

 black and red (male), or gray and red (female); the remiges and rec- 

 trices (except middle pair of the latter) yellow or red at base. 



Bill moderate in size, conical, compressed, sometimes attenate ter- 

 minally, its depth at base not more than length of maxilla from 

 nostril (usually less), its basal width (across base of mandible) much 

 less than the depth; exposed culmen not longer than middle toe with- 

 out claw (except in /S. notatus and S. n. Jbrreri), nearly straight, some- 

 times slightly convex, more rarely appreciably concave in middle 

 portion; gonys about equal to length of maxilla from nostril or slightly 

 shorter, straight or slightly concave; maxillary tomium nearly straight, 

 but always' with appreciable sinuation anterior to the very decided 

 basal deflection; mandibular tomium nearly straight to the strongly 

 convex, arched, or occasionally prominently angled subbasal portion. 

 Nostril small, roundish, more or less covered by antrorse latero-frontal 

 plumules; rictal bristles inconspicuous, or else having lateral barbules 

 and these modified into plumules like those covering the nasal fossae. 

 Wing long and pointed (ninth primai'y much longer than fifth, usually 

 equal to sixth, sometimes nearly equal to eighth, the eighth, or seventh 

 and eighth, longest); primaries exceeding secondaries bj' moi"e than 

 length of tarsus; tertials not longer than secondaries. Tail much more 

 than half but less than two-thirds as long as wing, distinctly emar- 

 ginate. Tarsus decidedly longer than exposed culmen, its scutella 

 distinct; middle toe, with claw, equal to or longer than tarsus; lateral 

 claws reaching about to base of middle claw; hallux about as long 

 as lateral toes, but much stouter, its claw not longer (usually shorter) 

 than the digit. 



Coloration. — Basal portion of remiges and rectrices (except some- 

 times in young) yellow or red, often exposed as conspicuous patches; 

 adults, at least adult males, with the plumage mamly black and yellow, 

 or black, olive-green, and yellow (black and scarlet or grayish and 

 scarlet in S. cvxiullatus) ; adult females (if different from males) olive- 

 greenish above, yellowish beneath, the wings and tail marked with 

 yellow, as in males.

 sometimes very broadly, rarely indistinctly), with dusky. 



Youn;/. — Similar to adults but wing-coverts tipped with buffy; 

 under parts often (but not always) tinged with sulphur yellow.

Northern coniferous forest districts of North America, breeding 

 south to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, parts of New England, lower 

 Hudson Valley (Sing Sing, Cornwall on Hudson, etc.), mountains of 

 Pennsylvania, and southward to high mountains of North Carolina, 

 Minnesota, etc. , and on the high western ranges quite to the southern 

 boundary of the United States; in winter, south to the Gulf coast 

 (including Florida and Texas), valleys of California, etc., and into 

 Mexico; casual or accidental in Cuba. 



' Twenty-two specimens. 

 '' Twenty-one speoLmens. 



Specimens from the Atlantic, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific coast districts compare 

 in average measurements as follows: 



Although specimens from the Rocky Mountain district appear to have the tail 

 decidedly shorter and the bill smaller than those from the Atlantic and Pacific dis- 

 tricts (which are practically identical in measurements), it is possible that a larger 

 series would show differently. I am unable to discover any color differences. The 

 individual variation in the latter respect is very great, but I have failed to make out 

 any correlation between these variations of coloration and geographic areas, both 

 the darkest and the palest, the brownest and the grayest, or those with heaviest 

 streaks on under parts, and those with these streaks almost obsolete, often occurring 

 in the same locality.

about 6.35 mm. or more in length, the concealed basal portion of the 

 secondaries likewise j'ellow; primary coverts and alula uniform black; 

 tail black, with about the basal half yellow, except middle rectrices, 

 which are blackish throughout, edged with olive-green, as is likewise 

 the blackish portion of the outer rectrices; bill horn color; legs and 

 feet similar, but darker. 



Immature malef^ — Similar to the preceding, but the olive-green of 

 upper parts inuch duller, becoming decidedly gray on hindneck; sides 

 of head and under parts dull gray, with a slight tinge of olive-green on 

 chest and sides; under tail-coverts pale grayish, with scarcelj^ a trace of 

 yellowish tinge; yellow at base of remiges both brighter and more 

 extended. 



Immature (f) male.^ — Similar to the preceding, but back and scapu- 

 lars gray, slightly mixed with olive-green, the interscapulars distinctly 

 but narrowly streaked with dusky; sides of head and under parts, 

 including whole throat and chin, plain light gray, becoming white on 

 abdomen. 



Younger {sex not determined).— SimilsiV, but pileum dull olive, the 

 feathers with dusky centers, producing an indistinctly spotted appear- 

 ance; iianks indistinctly streaked with duskj'. 



Adult mafe.— Length (skins), 114.30-116.8i (115.57); wing, 71.12- 

 72.39 (71.63); tail, 45.72-48.51 (47.60); exposed culmen, 10.41-11.43 

 (10.92); depth of bill at base, 5.84^7.11 (6.35); tarsus, 13.97-14.73 

 (14.22); middle toe, 10.92-12.19 (11.43).' 



Highlands of Guatemala (Quezaltenango, Hacienda Chancol, etc.) 

 and Chiapas (San Cristobal). 



This very distinct species is apparently more nearly related to 

 S. pinus than to S. notatus, the size and proportions being very nearly 

 the same. The fully adult male somewhat resembles in coloration 

 that of S. Hpinescens, of Colombia, but, besides having a much longer 

 wing and tail and differently shaped bill (the last broader basally but 

 more attenuated terminally), has the color of the under parts very 

 different (yellowish olive or gray instead of bright olive-yellow), and 

 the olive-green tips to the wing-coverts and margins to tertials much 

 broader. S. spinescens likewise has no dusky on the chin or throat, 

 and no dusky streaks on the under tail-coverts. 



^Possibly the adult female, since the date is the same as that of the adult male 

 described and the plumage is somewhat worn, thus indicating that it is at least a 

 bird of the second year. (Both specimens from. Quezaltenango, Guatemala, August, 

 1862, in the Salvin-Godman collection. )

SPINUS NOTATUS NOTATUS (Du B<is). 

 BLACK-HEADED SISKUT. 



Adult male. — Head, all i-ound, and foreneck, to upper part of chest, 

 deep black; hindneck, back, and scapulars j'ellowish olive-green, the 

 feathers with black central spots (sometimes mostly concealed and 

 inconspicuous) ; rump and under parts of body deep wax yellow or 

 dull gamboge yellow; wings, tail, and upper tail-coverts deep black, 

 the former relieved by a conspicuous area of bright lemon yellow on 

 the basal portion of the remiges (mostly concealed on secondaries but 

 occupying exposed third or more of primaries), the basal half, or more, 

 of rec trices (except middle pair) also lemon yellow; bill horn color 

 (sometimes bluish gray basally); legs and feet horn color.

 areas of wings and tail rather less extended. 



Young. — Wings as in adult female, but yellow on remiges still more 

 restricted, and middle and greater coverts tipped with pale yellow, 

 foi-ming two bands; rectrices dusky becoming yellow basally (but not 

 abruptly, as in adults) ; rest of upper parts dull j^ellowish olive, some- 

 what darker on crown, where indistinctly streaked with dusky; under 

 parts, including chin, throat, foreneck, and sides of head and neck, 

 light wax yellow; under tail-coverts more or less sti-eaked with dusky.

Owing to the insufBciency of material, many specimens being undetermined as to 

 sex, I am unable to give comparative average measurementa according to locality. 



Five specimens from Santa Ana, Honduras, are, unfortunately, all immature birds 

 (one of them in first plumage, the other four in transition dress), and I am therefore 

 unable to say whether the Honduras birds differ from ilexican examples. I can not 

 discern any difference between the immature birds. There are likewise no perfectly 

 adult birds from Guatemala in the collection.

The adult male of this well-marked form resembles in coloration the 

 adult female of S. n. noiat-ics, but the olive-yellowish color of the rump is 

 much more strongly contrasted with the olive-green of the back, and 

 the black of the throat extends much further backward. In fact, the 

 pattern of coloration is precisely the same as in the adult male of 

 S. n. woto^tts, and I therefore believe that the type of S.forreri^ supposed 

 by its describers to be an adult male, is in reality an adult female. At 

 any rate, it agrees minutely in coloration with adult females in the 

 collection of the Biological Survey, obtained in the States of Zacatecas 

 and Jalisco, by Messrs. Nelson and Goldman.

Similar to Spinu-s but bill relatively smaller, or less produced,' and 

 none of the species with yellow at base of remiges nor rectrices. 



Owing to the circumstance that the numerous species of Spiniis and 

 AstragaUnus differ so much among themselves in structural details, I 

 am unable to give a better diagnosis of the present group than the 

 above. The difference between the two groups in style of coloration 

 seems all the more important when it is taken into consideration that 

 in other respects as to coloration there is a very great range of varia- 

 tion in both groups. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF ASTKAGALINUS. 



a. No yellow on outer surface of wing-coverfs nor remiges. 

 h. Under tail-coverts white; upper tail-coverts white or grayish; inner webs of 

 exterior rectrices with white at tips, but not at base nor in middle portion, 

 c. White or otherwise light-colored markings of wings and tail more restricted 

 (adult male averaging, wing, 72.64; tail, 46.99). (Eastern United States,

Specimens from Guatemala and Chiapas average slightly larger, at 

 least in length of wing and tail, than those from farther southward, 

 and are appreciably paler j^ellow below; but the difference is much 

 less between those from Chiapas and Guatemala on the one hand and 

 those from the Isthmus of Panama than between the former and those 

 from more northern parts of Mexico. Average measurements of the 

 males in the two series, together with those from Costa Rica (an inter- 

 mediate district) and those of A. p. mexicanus, are as follows:

 are quite numerous. Such specimens have much less white on the 

 rectrices than A. p. croceus (sometimes merelj" a trace), while in some 

 it is asymmetrically developed, one side of the tail being as in tj'^pical 

 A. 2>- croceus, the other side as in A. p. columhianus.

BIKDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMEKIOA. 123 



Genus CARPODACUS Kaup. 



Carpodacus Kaup, Entw. Eur. Thierw., 1829, 161. (Type, Loxia erythrina 

 Linnasus. ) 



Erythrothorax Brehm, Vog. Deutschl., 1831, 249. (Type, Loxia erythrina Lin- 

 naeus. ) 



Hsemorhous (not of Boie, 1826) Swainsox, Claspjf. Birds, ii, 1837, 295. (Type, 

 Fringilla purpurea Gmelin. ) 



Pyrrhulinota Hodgson, in Gray's Zool. Misc., 1844, 85. (Type, Loxia erythrina 

 Linnaeus. ) 



Burrica Ridgway, Man. N. Am. Birds, 1887, 390. (Type, Fringilla mexicana 

 Miiller. ) 



Rather small or medium-sized (occasionally large) arboreal tiiiches, 

 with the bill moderately developed, short-conical; adult males with 

 the plumage at least partly red, adult females and young males olive, 

 brownish, or grayish, the under parts whitish conspicuously streaked 

 with the color of the upper surface. 



Bill shorter than head, conical, thick, its depth at base greater than 

 its width at same point and about equal to (or a little more or less than) 

 length of maxilla from nostril; culmen mostly nearly or quite straight 

 (purpureus, cassinii, roseiis, etc.), or decidedly curved throughout {mexi- 

 canus, erythrinus, thura, etc.) ; maxillary tomium straight or even faintly 

 convex in middle portion {purpureus, cassinii, roseus) or concave nearly 

 throughout {mexicanus, erythrvnus, -thura). Wing less than four to 

 more than five times as long as tarsus; ninth, eighth, and seventh, or 

 eighth, seventh, and sixth primaries longest, the ninth usually equal to 

 or longer than the sixth, sometimes equal to the eighth, rarely shorter 

 than sixth; primaries exceeding secondaries by less than length of tar- 

 sus {thura) to nearly twice as much. Tail less than three-fourths as 

 long as wing to five-sixths as long {thura), deeply emarginate {pur- 

 pureas, cassinii, etc.) to nearly or quite even {uiexicamis). Tarsus 

 short, about equal to middle toe with claw. 



Coloration. — Adult- males with more or less of red, and more or less 

 streaked; adult females and young conspicuously streaked, especially 

 on under parts. 



Bange. — Temperate portions of Europe, Asia, and JSlorth America, 

 southward, in the last, to southern Mexico. 



1 have been strongly inclined to separate the conical-billed, fork- 

 tailed species from those with convex culmen, more or less arched 

 maxillary tomium and less forked (sometimes quite even) tail, but find 

 the extremes so nearly connected by species of more or less interme- 

 diate character that I have finally concluded to follow the usual custom 

 of keeping them all in one genus. To do this, however, requires a 

 very ' ' elastic " generic diagnosis, as may be seen above. I have not 

 been able to examine more than three ^ of the considerable number of 



^ See note 2 on page 124. 




124 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Old World species assigned to the genus/- and it is possible that if 

 all the known species could be examined at once good reasons for a 

 justifiable subdivision of the genus could be found. Of the species 

 examined (including, besides all the American forms, the Palaearctic 

 C. erythi'lnus, C. roseus, and C. thnra^), C. thura is decidedly the most 

 aberrant, in its relatively long tail and shoi't wing — the former nearly 

 equaling the latter in length and the latter decidedlj' less than four 

 times as long as the tarsus — all the others having the tail little if any, 

 more, usually less, than three-fourths as long as the wing and the 

 latter from four and a half to more than five times as long as the 

 tarsus. O. thura is also peculiar in its short, rounded wing-tip, the 

 primaries exceeding the secondaries by less than the length of the 

 tarsus instead of by nearly twice the length of the latter; but it agrees 

 essentially with O. erythrinus and C. mexicanus in the form of the bill. 

 The habits of C. mexicanus are exceedingly difi'erent from those of 

 C. jmrpureus and ('. cassinu, resembling very closely those of the 

 house sparrow (Passer domestlcus), in nearly everj^ respect; but those 

 of O. erythrinus, which comes A-ery close to C. mexicanus in form, 

 appear to be essentially like those of C. j)urpiirevs.

 ■ streaked. ( Carpodacus purpnreus. ) 

 c. Wing longer (averaging 83.31 in male, 80.26 in female), with ninth primary

than length of tarsus; adult males with wing-feathers edged with pale grayish; 



adult females and immature males with upper parts brownish gra\- obsoletely 



streaked with darker. {Burrica.) 



' Except Hiematospiza sipalii, which Dr. Sharpe (Cat. Birds Brit, ilus., vol. xii., pp. 

 388, 097) refers to Carpodacus, taut which certainly possesses excellent generic 

 characters.

' There is considerable variation in the extent of the red on the under parts. 

 Usually it includes not only the entire throat, but also the upper part of the chest; 

 frequently it is confined to the throat; occasional!}' even the breast is faintly tinged 

 with red, but in such cases the intense red of the throat or upper chest is still sharply 

 contrasted with the pale red or pink behind it; in fact, all the red areas are always 

 sharply defined in this form. 



^ There is also much variation in the hue of the red, the color being more scarlet

Southern extremity of Mexican plateau, in the State of Oaxaca 

 (Huajualpam). 



I am by no means certain that the bird here separated is the O. 

 roseipecttis of Sharpe, since the two specimens examined lack entirely 

 any tinge of red on the breast, the red ending abruptly on the extreme 

 upper part of the chest. Since, however, C m. mexicanus may or may 

 not have a tinge of light red on the bx'east, it is likely the present 

 form varies in the same manner, and Sharpe's bird coming also from 

 Oaxaca it is most likely the present bird is the same form as his. 

 Whether the C. rosdpectus of Sharpe or not, however, this form may 

 be distinguished from C m. mexicanits, to which it is most nearly 

 allied, by its larger bill and decidedly darkey coloration, especially of 

 the red areas in the adult male.

Adult male. — Similar to the adult male of C. m. uiexicanus, but the 

 red much more extended, with outlines oJ: the different areas less 

 sharply defined; the occiput, hindneck, and back usually more or less

' In the great extension of the red, which characterizes the adult male of this form 

 as compared with that of C. Hi. mexicanus, C. ni. rhodocolpus agrees very closely with 

 the other conspecifio forms of western Mexico, C m. sonoriensis and C. m. ruberrimus, 

 many specimens of the three being practically identical in coloration. In size, how- 

 ever, there is a very marked difference between C. m. rhodocolpus and the above- 

 mentioned allies, the former being nearly if not quite as large as C. in. mexicanus, 

 while the other two are decidedly the smallest members of the group. C. m. rhodo- 

 colpus also averages darker, in both sexes, than either C. m. sonoriensis or C. m. 

 ruberrimus.

^Although first named by Cabanis, the latter cites "Bonap. Consp.,p. 533, no. 9, 

 jun." and " Bonap. Schleg. Mon. Lox., p. 15, tab. 16, fig. 1, jun." The name C. rhodo- 

 colpus is cited by Bonaparte as a synonym of C. frontalis, but he fortunately gives the 

 exact locality, which Cabanis fails to do. Bonaparte (loc. cit. ) states that the male 

 example of C. rhodocolpus Cabanis is from Cuernavaca (Morelos) and Cabanis cites 

 plate 16, fig. 1 of the Monographie des Loxiens. Reference to the figure in question 

 shows, however, that so far as coloration is concerned it does not represent either 

 C. m. mexicanus or the present form in their typical condition, having the greater 

 extension of red on the under parts of the latter with the restriction of red on upper 

 parts characterizing the former. Possibly the figure is wrongly colored as to the lat- 

 ter respect. At any rate, Cabanis's description leaves no doubt as to which form is 

 meant, his description being as follows: 



"It is scarcely smaller than the preceding species [C. inexicanas'] and resembles it 

 very much. It differs from it by the shade oi red, which is not poppy red, but 

 resembles the red of C. pjiirpureus very much. The demarcation of the red is less 

 sharp, the crown, the back, and the entire breast being more or less suffused with 

 red. A male of this species is in the Berlin Museum. It was referred to by Bona- 

 parte and Schlegel in their 'Monographie des Loxiens,' but was considered by them 

 to be a young male of C frontalis [i. e. C. mexicanus']." (Cabanis, Mus. Hein., i, p. 

 166, footnote; translation.) 



The specimen described by Cabanis was evidently a bird in winter plumage, this 

 form, like all the others, exhibiting a remarkable seasonal difference in the hue of 

 the red.

This is decidedly the smallest of the several geographic forms of 

 Carpodacits mexicanus, only that found immediately across the Gulf 

 of California ( O. in. sonoriensis) closely approaching it in measurements. 

 From the latter this peninsular form differs, so far as I can see, only 

 in its shorter wings and tail and slightly larger bill, the coloration 

 being quite identical. In this latter respect both these allied forms 

 are scarcely, if at all, different from C. m. rhodocolpus, of the south- 

 western border of the Mexican plateau, but their decidedly smaller 

 size will serve to readily distinguish them.

With a very good series of specimens for comparison, embracing altogether about 

 one hundred adult males and nearly forty adult females, I am unable to detect any' 

 differences of coloration or proportions that, in my judgment, would warrant the 

 further subdivision of the present form. Selecting from the series of adult males 

 those which have the red most limited in extent, that on the upper surface being 

 strictly confined to the forehead, supra-auricular stripes, and rump, the occiput and 

 back being without any reddish tinge, it is found that they come from San Francisco, 

 Fort Tejon, Santa Barbara, and Argus Mountains, California; Pinal County, Arizona; 

 San Diego, Chihuahua; Salt Lake City, Utah, and Fort Garland, Colorado. Then 

 separating those which have the red most extended , the back being strongly tinged 

 with red and the occiput more or less red, it is found that they represent several 

 localities in California, Fort Bowie and Tucson, Arizona, and Fort Clark and Fort 

 Hancock, Texas. It is thus seen that variation in the extent of the red is not 

 geographical. 



Specimens of the former group have the red areas occasionally as sharply defined 

 as in C. in. mexkmms, but the red is much less intense and the general coloration 

 decidedly lighter and grayer. Extreme specimens of the latter group, on the other 

 hand, are very similar in coloration to C. m. rliodocolpus, except that the brown por- 

 tions of the plumage are paler and grayer, taut they are considerably smaller.

 SAN BENITO HOUSE FINCH. 



Similar to C m. frontalis^ but much larger (the bill especially), 

 with relatively shorter wing and tail; upper parts much grayer and 

 more distinctly streaked with dusky; adult male with the red (con- 

 fined to forehead, supra-auricular stripe, malar region, chin, throat, 

 chest, and rump) paler, more flesh-colored, or often dull yellow. Much 

 more nearly related to C. ampins, but rather smaller, with bill distinctly 

 compressed basally, upper parts grayer, and flanks, etc. , with dusky 

 streaks darker and more .sharply defined. 



Adultmale. — Length (skin), one specimen, 146.05; wing, 81.79-82.55

Specimens from the different islands vary somewhat among themselves, but with 

 the exception of San Clemente, Santa Catalina, and Santa Rosa, there are not a suffi-

Average measurement of specimens from the different islands are as follows:

San Benito Island, Lower California. 



This local insular form is much more nearly related to V. ampltis, of 

 Guadalupe Island, than to C. met'lcanns eleiiicntis or anj' of the con- 

 tinental races of C. ■ine.r/'cam/g, but may at once be distinguished by 

 the different form of the bill, which, viewed from above, shows the 

 edges of the maxilla to be nearly or quite parallel for the basal half 

 (approximatelj^), then almost abruptly contracted to the tip, and also 

 loj the grayer coloration of the upper parts and paler hue of the red 

 or yellow in adult males. The latter apparently never assume the 

 bright red color often seen in adult males of C. amj>Iiis.

Guadalupe Island, Lower California. 



Occasionally, as in C. nn'.ricanus and its several subspecies, the usual 

 red of the adult male is replaced by dull yellow (saffron or gallstone). 

 The normal red is rather duller than that of C. inexiccnnis vici'ieaiuifi, 

 but is equally restricted and sharply defined, except that of the under 

 surface, which extends over the chest.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 147 



Long-winged, small-billed terrestrial finches, with the maxilla much 

 narrower, vertically, than- the mandible, the gonj'sverj' short (little if 

 anj' more than half the lateral length of the mandible), the hind claw 

 long and stronglj^ curved, and the plumage largely (sometimes chiefly) 

 white. 



Bill peculiar in shape, the maxilla being much shallower than the 

 mandible and the gonys very short (little if any more than half the lateral 

 length of the mandible) ; maxillary tomium slightly concave anteriorly, 

 then almost imperceptibly convex, with an abrupt basal deflection 

 beginning directly beneath the nostril. Nostrils quite concealed bj^ a 

 distinct appressed tuft of antrorse latero-frontal plumules. "Wing 

 long (nearly five times as long as tarsus) and pointed (ninth, eighth, 

 and seventh, usuallj' the ninth, primary longest); primaries exceeding 

 secondaries bj- twice the length of the tarsus; tertials not elongated. 

 Tail about three-fifths as long as wing, about two-thirds hidden bj' 

 the coverts, emarginated, the middle pair of rectrices pointed at tip. 

 Tarsus slightly longer than middle toe with claw, its scutella indistinct 

 or obsolete on outer side; lateral claws scarcely reaching base of middle 

 claw; hind claw about as long as its digit, slender, arched. 



Coloration. — Prevailing color white, the inner webs of rectrices 

 (except sometimes of two middle pairs) entirely so. Adult males in 

 simimer with head, neck, entire lower parts, lower back, rump, second- 

 aries (except, sometimes, tei'tials), and greater part of wing-coverts 

 entirely pure white; back and scapulars black or white; bill entirely 

 deep black. [In winter, the upper parts, sides of head, and chest 

 washed with rusty; bill j^ellow, the extreme tip dusky.) Adult females 

 smaller than males, the upper parts entirely streaked, the wings with 

 much less white, etc. Young: Pileum, hindneck, back and rump dull 

 grayish, indistinctly streaked with darker; lower parts dull whitish, 

 more or less tinged anteriorly with grayish (sometimes uniformly 

 grayish on throat, chest, etc.). 



Bcmge. — Arctic and subarctic districts of northern hemisphere (south- 

 ward in winter).

The largest specimens are those from the more western Aleutian Islands, including 

 the Commander Islands, Kamchatka; the smallest are from Unalaska and the Shu- 

 magin Islands, at the opposite end of the chain. These latter are in reality inter- 

 mediate between the island form and true P. nivalis, but seem nearest the former 

 and, therefore, best referred to it. Average measurements are as follows:

Genus CALCARIUS Bechstein. 



Calcarius Bechstein, Orn. Taschenb. Vog. Deutschl., 1803, 130. (Type, Frin- 



gilla lapponica Linnaeus. ) (See Stejneger, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., v, 1882, 32. )

Fringilla lapponica Linnaeus. ) 

 Cenirophanes Kaup, Entw. Eur. Thierw., 1829, 158. (Type, Fringilla lapponica 



Linnaeus.) 

 Leptoplectron Reichenbach, Av. Sy.st. Nat., 1850, pi. 75. (Type, Emberiza picta 



Swainson. ) 



Medium-sized or rather small terrestrial finches, with long, pointed 

 wings, small bill, long and slender hind claw, and plumage much varied. 



Bill small (commissure shorter than middle toe without claw), acutely 

 conical, deeper than broad at base; culmen nearly straight, sometiaies 

 appreciably depressed in middle portion; gonys straight, shorter than 

 hallux without claw, its base about midway between tip and lateral 

 base of the mandible; depth of bill at base decidedly less than distance 

 from nostril to tip of maxilla. Nasal plumules indistinct, the nostrils 

 quite exposed. Wing long (about four and one-third to more than four 

 and one-half times as long as tarsus), pointed (three outermost prima- 

 ries longest, with the ninth longer than the sixth, sometimes longer 

 than the eighth); primaries exceeding secondaries by one and one- 

 quarter to one and one-half times length of tarsus; tips of secondaries 

 emarginate. Tail more than two-thirds as long as wing, double- 

 rounded or deeply emarginate {ornatus), more than half hidden by the 

 pointed upper coverts. Tarsus nearly or quite one-third as long as 

 tail, longer than middle toe with claw, its scutella nearl}' obsolete; 

 lateral claws scarcely or not reaching base of middle claw; hind claw 

 nearly equal to — sometimes longer than — its digit, very slender, slightly 

 arched or nearly straight. 



Coloration. — Adult males with top of head black; hindneck deep 

 rufous or buff; rest of upper parts light brownish, broadly streaked 

 with dusky or black; outer tail-feathers with more or less of white. 

 Adult females similar above to males, but without black on head, 

 and usually without distinct rufous or buff on hindneck; lower parts 

 mainly dull whitish or buffy. 



The three species of Calcarius differ considerably in details of form. 

 C. ficiMS is very similar to the type species, C. lajpj>oniGm, but has a

more slender and pointed bill, like that of C. nmaticn. The latter 

 differs from the two preceding in having the tail much shorter than the 

 distance from the carpal joint of the wing to the end of the tertials, in 

 which respect it agrees with Rhynchoj>liane)i incanoiili, but this differ- 

 ence is apparently owing to greater development of the secondaries 

 rather than to a really reduced length of the tail; the outermost (ninth) 

 primary is also relatively shorter. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OP CALCARIUS. 



a. Four outermost rectrices dusky at base, at least on inner web. 

 h. Abdomen white; less than half the inner web of outermost rectrix white, 

 c. Back heavily streaked with black or dusky, the dusky centers to feathers 

 wider than the lighter grayish brown edgings. 

 d. Paler, with outer webs of greater wing-coverts and tertials grayish brown 

 or but slightly rufescent. (Northern Europe and northeastern North 



America. ) Calcarius lapponious lapponious (p. 155 ) 



dd. Darker, with outer webs of greater wing-coverts and tertials bright rusty 



brown or chestnut. (Commander Islands, Kamtschatka, and other 



parts of northeastern Asia. ) . .Calcarius lapponious ooloratus^ (extralimital) 



cc. Back more narrowly streaked with black or dusky, the dusky centers to 



feathers not wider than the pale huffy brown or grayish buffy edgings.

Caloarius lapponious alasoensis (p. 158) 

 hb. Abdomen buffy or ochraceous, like rest of under parts; more than half of inner 

 web of outermost rectrix white. (Great Plains of United States and Brit- 

 ish America. ) Calcarius piotus (p. 160) 



aa. Four outermost rectrices extensively white at base, on both webs. (Great Plains 

 of United States and Mexico. ) Calcarius ornatus (p. 162) 



CALCARIUS LAPPONICUS LAPPONICUS (Linnaeus). 

 LAPLAND LONGSPUK. 



Inner web of outermost rectrix chiefly dusky; under wing-coverts 

 and axillars grayish white, distinctly grayish beneath surface; breast 

 and abdomen white in adults. 



Adult male in summer. — Head and chest deep black, relieved by a 

 broad white or buffy stripe behind eye, continued downward (verti- 

 cally) behind ear-coverts and then backward along sides of chest; sides 

 broadly streaked or striped with black; rest of under parts white; hind- 

 neck deep chestnut -rufous; lesser wing-coverts grayish, feathers black 

 in center. 



Adult male In winter. — Black of head confined to crown, posterior 

 and lower border of ear-coverts, lower part of throat, and patch on 



^Calcarius lapponicus coloratus Ridgway, Auk, xv, Oct., 1898, 320 (Copper Island,

 in the westernmost Aleutian Islands, aa well as for comparison with the other sub- 

 species.

 feathers; sides of head (including lores and greater part of ear-coverts), 

 mostly dull light brownish; rufous on hindneck also similar Ij' obscured. 



Adult female in summer. — Much like winter male, but markings 

 more sharply defined, black areas of chest, etc. , more restricted and 

 still more broken, hindneck streaked with blackish, and size smaller. 



Adult female in winter. — Similar to summer plumage, but browner 

 and less sharply streaked above, hindneck often without trace of 

 rufous, lower parts dull brownish white, and duskv markings of chest, 

 etc., very indistinct. 



Yi'uiKj. — Above dull builj^ everj-where (except on wings and tail) 

 broadh' streaked with black; beneath pale buffy, the lower throat, 

 chest, and sides of breast broadly streaked with blackish.

- J^ine specimens. 



European specimens are apparently the same in coloration as those from northeast- 

 ern North America, but the series of the former which I have been able to examine 

 is very small, consisting of only two adult males and three adult females. The aver- 

 age measurements reveal some differences, which, however, appear to be the result 

 of too great inequality in number of the specimens of the two aeries, the length of 

 wing, tail, and culmen being decidedly greater in the European males, but smaller in 

 the European females. The averages are as follows: 



MALES. 



Two adult males from northern Europe 



Fourteen adult males from northeastern North 

 America (including Greenland)

Similar to C. I. lapponicus, but decidedly lighter in color, especially 

 in winter plumage; in summer, adults with ground color of upper parts 

 light buffy grayish brown, with little, if any, rusty tinge, even on wing- 

 coverts and tertials, and the black streaks relatively narrower than in 

 C. I. lapponicus, the chestnut-rufous or deep cinnamon-rufous of the 

 hindneck also averaging paler than in O. I. lapponicus,' winter speci- 

 mens (adults and young) with upper parts conspicuously paler and more 

 buffy than corresponding plumages of O. I. lapponicus; young in first 

 plumage much brighter buffy, both above and on chest, than that of 

 C. I. lapponicus, with the blackish streaks narrower, and outer webs of 

 greater wing-coverts and secondaries much lighter chestnut-brown.

Specimens from the mainland of Alaska are less typical than those from the islands, 

 but do not differ appreciably in coloration, except in the nestling plumage, which is 

 intermediate between that of the island birds and that of true C. lapponicus (Green- 

 land specimens). The mainland birds average even smaller than true C. lapponicus 

 and have the wing and tail decidedly shorter than those from any of the Alaskan 

 islands, as the average below will show. 



The great contrast in coloration is just as marked between specimens from the 

 extreme western Aleutian Islands ( Atkha, Adak, and Attu) and the extremely dark 

 form ( C. /. coloratus) of the Commander Islands, as between the latter and specimens 

 from the Pribilofs and Unalaska.

Genus RHYNCHOPHANES Baird. 



Rhynchopha-iies Baird, Eep. Pacific E. E. Surv., ix, 1858, 432, in text. (Type, Plec- 

 trophanes mccoumii Lawrence. ) 



Rather small terrestrial Fringillidee related to Calcarvus, but differing 

 in much larger and relatively thicker bill (with maxilla equal in depth 

 to the mandible) and relatively shorter tail (decidedly shorter than dis- 

 tance from carpus to tips of longest secondaries, instead of longer). 



Bill stout, conical, much deeper than broad at base; culmen appre- 

 ciablj' depressed in middle portion; maxilla about equal' in depth to 

 mandible; angulation of maxillary tomium considerably posterior to 

 middle; gonys nearly straight, but appreciably convex, longer than 

 hallux without claw, and exceeding basal depth of bill; the latter 

 nearly or quite equal to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla. Nasal 

 plumules well developed, nearly concealing nostrils, the stiff rictal 

 plumules quite covering the deflected basal portion of the maxillary 

 tomium. Wing long (nearly five times as long as tarsus), pointed 

 (three outermost primaries longest, the ninth nearly equal to eighth, 

 much longer than sixth); primaries exceeding secondaries by nearly 

 twice the length of the tarsus; tertials decidedly longer than second- 

 aries. Tail between one-half and two-thirds as long as wing, 

 (decidedly shorter than distance from carpus to tips of longest

secondaries), emarginated, the middle rectrices pointed, more than half 

 hidden by the pointed upper coverts. Tarsus longer than middle toe 

 with claw, its scutella nearh' obsolete; lateral claws not reaching base of 

 middle claw ; hind claw about equal to its digit, slender, nearly straight. 



Colors. — Conspicuously streaked above; tail white, with broad dusky 

 terminal band, the middle rectrices wholly dusky; adult male with 

 black forehead and jugular patch and chestnut patch on middle wing- 

 coverts. 



Range. — Interior plains of North America, east of Rocky Mountains. 

 (Monotypic.) 



RHYNCHOPHANES McCOWNII (Lawrence). 

 ffloCOWN'S LONGSPUB. 



Tail (except middle pair of recti'ices) white, broadljr tipped with 

 dusky. 



Adult male in summer. — Forehead and anterior portion of crown, 

 more or less distinct rictal streak, and crescentic patch across chest, 

 black; posterior portion of pileum and hindneck pale brownish gray, 

 streaked with dusky, especially the former; back and scapulars pale 

 wood brown, or pale buffy brown, broadly streaked with duskj^; rump 

 and upper tail-coverts grayer (especially the latter), less distinctly 

 streaked; more anterior lesser wing-coverts ash gray with dusky 

 (mostly concealed) centers; posterior lesser coverts and middle coverts 

 chestnut; rest of wing grayish dusky with pale brownish gray edg- 

 ings, the primaries narrowly edged with white (outer web of first pri- 

 mary almost entirely white), the greater coverts and secondaries 

 rather broadlj- (but not distinctly) tipped with white; middle pair of 

 rectrices dusky grayish brown margined with paler; rest of tail white, 

 broadly tipped with dull black, except outermost rectrices, where the 

 blackish, if present, is very much reduced in extent; under parts 

 (except chest) white, tinged with pale gv&y laterally, the plumage 

 deep gray beneath the surface; bill brownish, dusky at tip; iris brown; 

 tarsi brown; toes dusky. 



Adult male hi uunter. — Black areas concealed hj broad tips to 

 feathers, brown on pileum, buffy on chest; otherwise not essentially 

 different from summer plumage. 



Adult female in sumvier.— Above, light buffy brown (pale wood 

 brown or Isabella color), streaked with blackish, the streaks broadest 

 on back and scapulars; wings dusky, with light buffy brown edgings 

 (broadest on greater coverts and tertials, narrower, paler and grayer 

 on primaries, and primary coverts), the middle coverts broadly tipped 

 with buffy, the lesser coverts pale brownish gray; tail as in adult 

 male; sides of head (including broad superciliary stripe) light dull 

 buffy, relieved hj a rather broad postocular streak of brownish; under 

 parts pale buffy, passing into white on abdomen and under tail-coverts; 

 a brown or dusk}' streak (submalar) along each side of throat. 




166 BULLETIN 50, TJNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Adult female in winter. — Similar to summer plumage, but dusky 

 streaks on back, etc. , narrower and less distinct, and under parts rather 

 more strongly tinged -with buffy. 



Young. — Back, scapulars, and rump dusky, with distinct pale buffy 

 margins to the feathers; pileum and hindneck streaked with dusky 

 and pale buffy; middle wing-coverts broadly margined, and greater

 rather long (nearly four times as long as tarsus), with truncated tip 

 (ninth to sixth primaries abruptly longest, but ninth shorter than sixth) ; 

 tail about three-fourths as long as wing, nearly even; tarsus more than 

 one-third as long as tail, stout; adult male in summer black, with a 

 large white patch on wing-coverts; adult male in winter, adult female, 

 and young, conspicuously streaked. 



Bill rather large, conical, much deeper than broad at base; exposed 

 culmen more than half as long as tarsus, gently convex terminally and 

 basally, nearly straight in middle portion; gonys nearly straight, its 

 length about equal to basal width of mandible; maxillary tomium 

 faintly notched near tip, nearly straight to beneath nostril, where 

 abruptly deflected at an angle of about 45°, but soon turned backward

to the rictus, producing a conspicuous convex lobe; mandibular tomium 

 faintly convex anteriorly, then straight to the distinctly angulated 

 basal deflection. Nostril small, nearly circular, exposed, but" nasal 

 f oasse otherwise filled with feathers. Rictal bristles obvious, but very 

 weak. Wing rather long (nearly four times as long as tarsus), its tip 

 nearly truncated (four outermost primaries abruptly longest, but 

 ninth shorter than sixth); primaries exceeding secondaries by less 

 than length of tarsus; tertials slightly produced beyond secondaries. 

 Tail about three-fourths as long as wing, much inore than its basal half 

 overlaid by upper coverts, slightly double rounded or nearly even, the 

 rectrices rather narrow. Tarsus rather long (more than one-third as 

 long as tail), stout, its scutella indistinct, especially on outer side; 

 middle toe with claw about as long as tarsus or a very little shorter; 

 lateral claws not reaching to base of middle claw; hallux about as 

 long as inner toe, its claw nearly as long as the digit. 



Coloration. — Adult male in summer uniform black, with white 

 wing-coverts; adult male in winter, female, and young conspicuously 

 streaked, the wing with a more or less conspicuous whitish or pale 

 buffy patch.

CALAMOSPIZA MELANOCORYS Stejneger. 

 LARK BUNTING. 



Adult male in summer. — Uniform black, with more or less of a 

 grayish cast on back, etc.; middle and greater wing-coverts mostly 

 white, forming a conspicuous patch; tertials edged with white, and 

 tail-coverts (especialh' the lower) margined with white; outermost 

 rectrices edged with white and sometimes with a large white spot at 

 tip of inner web.^ 



AcIaM female in summer. — Above grayish brown streaked with duskj' ; 

 wings with a white patch, as in the male, but this smaller, more inter- 

 rupted, and more or less tinged with buffy; under parts white, streaked 

 on breast, sides, etc., with dusky. 



Adult male in winter. — Similar to adult female, but feathers of under 

 parts, especially on abdomen, black beneath the surface (this showing 

 where feathers are disarranged); chin black. 



Adidt female in vjinter. — Similar to the summer female, but less 

 grayish brown and with the paler markings more stronglv tinged with 

 buff. 



Young. — Siioilar to adult female, but more buffj', with feathers of 

 upper parts margined with buffy white, and streaks on under parts 

 narrower. 



^ These minor white markings are conspicuous only in fresh plumage and disappear 

 by abrasion, being therefore usually absent in midsummer specimens.

Bill rather large (exposed culmen more than half as long as the long 

 tarsus), conical, much deeper than broad at base; depth at base nearly 

 equal to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; mandible deeper than 

 maxilla, its tomium nearly straight to the subbasal angle, where 

 abruptly deflected; maxillary tomium faintly concave anteriorly, then 

 gently convex, the decided basal deflection beginning directly beneath 

 the nostril; culmen gently convex at base and tip, straight between; 

 gonys very slightly convex, nearly as long as the distance from nostril 

 to tip of maxilla. Nostril exposed, with very narrow overhanging 

 membrane. Rictal bristles small, indistinct. Wing long (more than 

 three times as long as the long tarsus), pointed (ninth primary longest 

 or equal to longest); primaries exceeding secondaries by about the 

 length of the tarsus. Tail about three-fourths as long as wing, more 

 than half hidden by the upper coverts, emarginate, the middle rectrices 

 narrow and pointed. Tarsus a little longer than middle toe with claw 

 (about three-tenths as long as wing and two-fifths as long as tail), its 

 scutella distinct; lateral claws falling decidedly short of base of middle 

 claw; hallux about as long as lateral toes, but much stouter, its claw 

 decidedly shorter than the digit.

 and on Swan Island (Caribbean Sea); breeding from South Carolina (for- 

 merly), Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas north to North Dakota, Minne- 

 sota, Wisconsin, Michigan (south of lat. 43^), southern Ontario, etc., 

 formerly to eastern Massachusetts (Medford, Hingham, Hyde Park, 

 etc.). Now chiefly restricted during the breeding season to the region 

 between the Allegheny Mountains and eastern base of the Rocky 

 Mountains, having for unknown reasons, become practicallj- extinct 



' Sometimes there are two or more black spots succeeding one another; often a 

 larger, shield-shaped spot on lower throat and a smaller one, of more irregular shape, 

 on center of breast.

Genus POOECETES Baird. 



Poocxtes Baird. Rep. Pacific R. R. Surv. , ix, 1 858, 439, 447. (Type Fnngilla gram- 

 inea Gmelin.) , 



Pooeceto (emendation) B,\ird, Rep. Pacific R. R. Surv., ix, 1858, pp. xx, xxix. 

 (See Gill, Auk, xvi, Jan., 1899, 20. ) 



Pocecetes (emendation) Sclatbe, Proo. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, 379. 



Small, conspicuously streaked terrestrial Fringillidae with lateral 

 rectrices largely white, and with the tarsus decidedly longer than 

 middle toe with claw. 



Bill small (exposed culmen about half as long as tarsus), conical, 

 much deeper than broad at base, its basal depth less than distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla: culmen straight or even faintly depressed in 

 middle portion, gentlj^ convex terminally and basally; gonys straight, 

 about equal to or sometimes longer than basal depth of bill; maxillary 

 tomium faintly concave anteriorly', then faintly convex, its basal por- 

 tion slightly deflected; mandibular tomium straight to the well-defined 

 subbasal angle, its basal deflection more abrupt and decided than that 

 of the maxilla. Nostril small, triangular (apex forward), with broad 

 superior valve, nearly concealed by the frontal plumules. Rictal bristles 

 fairly distinct. Wing long (about four times as long as the rather long 

 tarsus), pointed (ninth to sixth primaries longest, the ninth equal 

 to or longer than sixth, sometimes almost longest); primaries exceed- 

 ing secondaries bj- about the length of the tarsus; tertials not pro- 

 duced beyond secondaries, or but slightly so. Tail about three-fourths 

 as long as wing, about one-half overlaid by upper coverts, emarginate, 

 the rectrices i-ather narrow. Tarsus about twice as long as exposed cul- 

 men, its scutella rather indistinct, especial^ on outer side; middle toe 

 with claw slightly shorter than tarsus; lateral claws reaching nearly or 

 quite to base of middle claw; hallux about as long as inner toe, its 

 claw slightl}'^ shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Conspicuously streaked above and below (except cen- 

 tral and posterior under parts), the lateral rectrices largely white; 

 adults with lesser wing-coverts reddish brown. 



Bange. — Temperate North America. (Monotypic.) 



This genus comes verj'' near to PasseTculuH^ but may be distiguished 

 by its relativelj' much longer wing and shorter tarsus.

 VESPER SPARROW. 



Adults {sexes alike). — Above light grayish brown (hair brown) con- 

 spicuously streaked with black, the streaks broadest on back, less dis- 

 tinct on rump; lesser wing-coverts cinnamon or russet, with a dusky 

 (mostly concealed) wedge-shaped central space; wings otherwise and 

 tail dusky, the feathers edged with light grayish brown, especially the 

 larger wing-coverts and secondaries, the former (middle and greater 

 coverts) indistinctly tipped with pale dull buffy or bufly whitish, form- 

 ing indistinct narrow bands; outermost tail-feather largely white, 

 this involving most of the outer web and the terminal half, approxi- 

 mately, of the inner web next the shaft, the dusky extending along 

 the innermost (longitudinal) half within half an inch, or less, of the 

 tip; superciliary region light grayish brown or brownish gray nar- 

 rowly and indistinctly streaked with duskj'; auricular region browner, 

 margined above and below bj^ a postocular and a rictal streak of dusky 

 brownish; a white or buffy white malar stripe margined below by a 

 series of dusky streaks along each side of throat; under parts dull 

 white, more or less tinged- with pale buffy on chest, sides, and flanks, 

 where streaked with dusky; under tail-coverts immaculate; maxilla 

 dusky brownish, mandible much paler (pinkish or lilaceous in life); 

 iris brown; legs and feet pale brownish. 



Young. — Essentially similar to adults, but markings less sharply 

 defined; scapulars and interscapulars broadly edged with pale buffy 

 grayish, and ground color of under parts rather grayish white than 

 buffy.

Genus PASSERCULUS Bonaparte. 



Passerculus Bonaparte, Geog. and Comp. List., 1838, 33. (Type, Fringilla savanna 

 Wilson. ) 



Small, conspicuously streaked terrestrial Fringillid^, resembling 

 Pooecetes but with wing-tip much shorter than tarsus, the latter nearly 

 one-third as long as wing; middle toe, with claw, nearly as long as tarsus; 

 tail not more than three-fourths as long as wing, the outermost rec- 

 trices without white. Differing from Genironyx in relatively longer tail 

 (shorter than wing by much less than length of tarsus), with broader 

 and less acuminate rectrices; hallux not longer than inner toe, its claw 

 not longer than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; fifth primary 

 much shorter than sixth; coloration very different. 



Coloration. — Above brownish or grayish, more or less streaked, the 

 pileum with or without a paler median and darker lateral stripes; no 

 white on lateral (or other) rectrices; no distinct wing-bands, buttertials 

 conspicuously blackish centrally; under parts whitish, streaked, except 

 on abdomen and under tail-coverts, with brown or blackish, the throat 

 with or without streaks; more or less distinct superciliary and malar 

 stripes of pale grayish, light dull buffy or whitish, the former some- 

 times yellowish, especially anteriorly. 



Range. — Whole of North America, including Mexico. 



This genus contains apparently four distinct specific types, repre- 

 sented, respectively, by P. princeps, P. sandiuiehmsis, P. ieldingi, 

 and P. rostratxm, the second and last including several subspecific 

 forms. It is possible, however, that the first may be really only an 

 insular form of the second (as has already been claimed), and it is 

 almost equally possible that the third may intergrade with both the 

 second and last, one of the several forms of southern California {P. 

 hxilophihiJi) being at least suggestive of such relationship. For the 

 present, however, or until intergradation can be satisfactorily demon- 

 strated, I prefer to consider the three types specifically distinct.

It will thus be seen that there is no essential variation in measurements throughout 

 the very extensive breeding range of this form, which extends from northwestern 

 Alaska to the table-lands of southern Mexico. Many of the Mexican specimens were 

 obtained during the breeding season, and these I am unable to distinguish in any 

 way from breeding examples obtained at more northern localities. 



The type of Ammodramus sandwichensis brunnescens Butler (obtained November 20 

 in the Valley of Mexico) is a specimen of P. s. hryanti; but other specimens so 

 labeled, taken by Mr. Butler in the same locality during December, are typical 

 examples of P. «. alaudinus, and I am able to match them perfectly with fall and 

 winter specimens from the western United States.

 BRYANT'S MARSH SPARROW. 



Similar to JP. s. savanna, but smaller and darker, with more slender 

 bill; decidedly smaller and very much darker and browner than I^. s. 

 alaudinits, with black dorsal streaks very much broader, the under 

 parts much more heavily streaked with black, and in winter plumage, 

 with the chest, sides, etc., strongly tinged with brownish buff. 



Adult male.—hength (skins), 116.06-127.00 (120.90); wing, 63.75- 

 71.12 (67.06); tail, 44.20-50.80 (48.01); exposed culmen, 10.16-11.43

Coast of California (salt marshes), breeding chieflj'' about San 

 Francisco Bay; occasionally southward in winter to central Mexico 

 (Valley of Mexico). 



[The type specimen of ATrnmodvam/us sandwichensis lyrutvnescens 

 Butler agrees minutely with examples of this form from the coast 

 of California. There is no yellow whatever in the superciliary stripe; 

 but this character is more or less variable in all the forms of this 

 species, and some Californian specimens of the present form are 

 equally destitute of yellow on the superciliary or supraloral region. 



An adult female fromTlalpam, Mexico (No. 143780, U. S. Nat. Mus., 

 Dec. 8, 1892, E. W. Nelson) is closely similar to Mr. Butler's type of 

 A. s. hrunnescens, and practically indistinguishable from some Califor- 

 nian examples.]

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 203 



Range. — Great Plains of North America. (Monotypic.) 

 This genus is unquestionably far more nearly related to Cotumicu- 

 lus than to Passerculiis, but differs from it in the characters mentioned 

 above; both Oentronyx and Coturniculus differing from Passercuhis in 

 additional characters which they share together (see "Key" to the 

 genera, pages 34, 35).

Admits {sexes alike). — Head ochraceous or buffy, deepest on pileum, 

 palest (often nearly or quite white) on chin and throat; pileum streaked 

 with black, especially laterally; a blackish rictal streak, and a black 

 submalar streak; prevailing color of upper parts light brown, varied 

 by blackish central spots and buffy edgings to the feathers; under 

 parts white or pale buffy, the chest, sides, and flanks streaked with 

 black; bill brownish, the mandible paler (pale flesh color in life); iris 

 brown; legs pale brownish yellow (pale flesh color in life), the toes 

 and claws darker.

Genus COTURNICULUS Bonaparte. 



CoHurniculus Bonaparte, Geog. and Comp. List., 1838, 32. (Type, Fringilla

Small terresti'ial Fringillidse with the sixth primary abruptly shorter 

 than the seventh; hallux shorter than outer toe, but decidedly longer 

 than inner toe, its claw shorter than distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla; edge of wing yellow; adult without black streaks on under 

 parts. Differing from Aiamodrcumis in having the outermost (ninth) 

 primary longer than the seventh; the tail relatively shorter (shorter 

 than wing by nearly length of tarsus), emarginate, or slightly double 

 rounded, with lateral rectrices but little if any shorter than middle 

 pair and much less acuminate. 



Mange. — Temperate North America, including whole of Mexico; 

 Greater Antilles. (Monotypic.) 



If Ooturnicul/us is to be recognized even as a subgenus it must neces- 

 sarily be restricted (among known species) to C. swvanna/rum and its 

 continental subspecies, since the two species usually associated are 

 found on comparison to differ quite decidedly in structural details, 

 which agree with those of Ammodramiis. 



The South American species usually referred to Ooturniculus are 

 still more different structurallj^, and have been removed by me into 

 another genus. ^

AdulfH in suiamer (sexes althe). — Pileum blackish, narrowly streaked 

 with light gray or grayish bufly and divided medially by a distinct line 

 of pale grayish buff; rest of upper parts mixed grayish, pale buffy, 

 rusty brown and black, the last prevailing on back and scapulars, 

 where forming large, more or less coalesced central or median spots; 

 hindneck grayish, streaked with chestnut, the chestnut streaks some- 

 times black medially; feathers of rump streaked or spotted with rusty 

 brown, the streaks sometimes black basally; wings duskj^, with distinct 

 pale buffj' grayish edgings, the lesser coverts mostly yellowish olive, 

 passing into yellow on edge of wing; sides of head, including broad 

 superciliary stripe, dull buffy, paler and more grayish on lores, the 

 supraloral region yellowish; a dusky postocular streak; under parts 

 buffy, becoming white or nearly so, on lower breast, abdomen, and

 crown-stripe deeper buffy, the hindneck broadly streaked with chest- 

 nut, interscapulars distinctly edged with buff and gray, buff of under 

 parts deeper, that of chest sometimes indistinctly streaked with 

 chestnut. 



Young. — Pileum dusky with an indistinct median stripe of pale

1 have some hesitation in referring the females whose measure- 

 ments are given above to this form, for the reason that they are so 

 much larger and so different in color from the males, in both respects 

 being, for all that I can see, identical with C ■?. passerivus. It is 

 scarcely likely, however, that in the series of specimens collected at two 

 localities as widely separated as Minatitlan, Vera Cruz, and Palenque, 

 Chiapas, all the males would represent one form and all the females 

 another, especially since the two sexes were at each place collected on 

 the same dates.

C'oloratii))!.. — Above varying from nearlj' uniform olive-grayish or 

 blackish to conspicuoush" spotted with black, brown, or chestnut, and 

 streaked with bufly, the median rectrices light brownish or grayish 

 with a median stripe or streak of dusky; beneath whitish or buff and 

 white, the chest, sides, and flanks more or less streaked with black or 

 grayish; edge of wing usually yellow (white in ^4. leconteii). 



Range. — Eastern and central temperate North America. 



The four species to which I have, after careful examination and com- 

 parison, concluded to restrict the genus Ammodraimm agree fairly 

 well in structural and other characters. Two of them, however, are 

 much less closely related than are the other two, being not only quite 

 different from one another in structural details but from the other two 

 as well. These aberrant species are A. niaritinvu.s and A. Iienslowii. 

 The former, while agreeing rather closely with the type-species {A. 

 caudacutus) in longer and relative)}^ more slender bill, and to a consid- 

 erable degree in coloration, differs in its veiy much rounded wing-tip, 

 the ninth primary being not longer than the third, instead of being 

 equal to the sixth and fifth, as in all the others. A. henslowii has a 

 very much stouter bill than any of the rest, and the subbasal angle of 

 the mandibular tomia is distinctly toothed — a character possessed by 

 none of its congeners; in other respects, however, it comes vei'y close 

 to A. leconteii, which is closely related to A. caudacutu.s, through its 

 smaller and small-billed subspecies, A. cavdcccutiiJi nelsoni. -A. leconteii 

 is the only species having the tail and wing of the same length, all the 

 others having the wing slightly but decidedly the longer.

There is a decided difference in average measurements between specimens from 

 the Atlantic coast States and those from the Mississippi Valley, the former averaging 

 larger, especially the bill and feet. I have not been able to discover any differences 

 of coloration, however, and therefore do not separate them. Winter specimens from 

 South Carolina agree in measurements with the Western series and are without much 

 doubt migrants from the same region. Average measurements are as follows:

""Name from TtsvKi), a pine." 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 231 



Small or medium-sized semiterrestrial FringillidaB with tail equal to 

 or longer than wing, and more or less graduated; wing rather short 

 and rounded (sometimes very much so), the outermost (ninth) primary 

 not longer than fourth, usually shorter than second, sometimes shorter 

 than secondaries. 



Bill very variable as to relative size and thickness, sometimes large 

 and stout, sometimes small and rather slender; culmen moderately or 

 faintly convex throughout or, usually, straight (sometimes even slightly 

 depressed) in middle portion; gonys about equal to basal depth of bill, 

 or slightly less, straight or faintly convex; maxillary tomium without 

 subterminal notch, faintly concave anteriorly, then faintly convex, again 

 faintly concave just anterior to the nearly concealed basal deflection; 

 mandibular tomium straight, oi- nearly so, to the abruptly deflected basal 

 portion, the subbasal angle sometimes slightly toothed. Rictal bristles 

 indistinct. Nostrils rather nari-ow, longitudinal, more or less pointed 

 anteriorly, overhung by a more or less distinct (usually conspicuous) 

 superior operculum. Wing short (two and three-fourths to nearly 

 three and a-half times as long as tarsus), much rounded, or truncate, 

 at tip (eighth to fifth primaries longest, ninth not longer than fourth, 

 usually shorter than second, sometimes shorter than secondaries), the 

 primaries exceeding secondaries by much less than length of tarsus 

 (usually by less than length of culmen) ; tertials not elongated. Tail 

 equal to or longer than wing,^ sometimes much longer, more or 

 less graduated (graduation sometimes more than half the length of 

 tarsus), the rectrices rather narrow but with rounded tips. Tarsus 

 longer than middle toe with claw;^ lateral toes about equal, their claws 

 falling short of base of middle claw; hind claw decidedly shorter than 

 its digit, the two together not longer (usually shorter) than middle toe 

 without claw. 



Coloration. — Back more or less streaked, or else plain purplish 

 grayish brown; under parts without streaks in adults, except some- 

 times on sides and flanks; otherwise extremely variable (see "Key," 

 pages 233 to 235). 



Range. — Sonoran or Lower Austral districts of United States and 

 southward through Mexico and Central America (chiefly on highlands) 

 to western Costa Rica. 



I am far from satisfied with the limits which are here assigned the genus 

 AiTTuo^phila^ but have not been able, after repeated and tedious efl'orts, 

 to devise any improvement. If Peuccea is to be retained as a separate 

 genus it must be restricted to include only P. cestivalis (with its sub- 

 species), P. hotterii, and P. cassini, since there can be no question 

 that Ammodramus nificeps Cassin and Peuccea carpalis Coues are 



^ Sometimes a little less in specimens with tips of rectrices much worn. 

 'A little shorter only in some specimens of A. humeralw.

strictly congeneric with Aiino2?MIa rufescens (type of the genus) and A. 

 sianichrmti^ respectively. The species which belong to Peuccea in the 

 restricted sense indicated above differ from the true Awiopliilm in their 

 decidedly more produced and truncated wing-tip and longer outer- 

 most primaries, the ninth primary never shorter than the third and 

 usually equal to the fourth, while in the true Aimophilce it is never lopger 

 than the second and sometimes shorter than the first, the longest pri- 

 maries oxceedingthe secondai-ies by more than half the length of tarsus 

 instead of less than length of culmen. They also have weaker feet, 

 with relatively longer and straighter claws, and the hallux is relatively 

 lonoer. Were there no species of intermediate character to bridge 

 over the gap between these two groups a genus Peucwa might be rec- 

 ognized, but unfortunately this is not the case, " Ammodrmnus" peteni- 

 CU8 being an Airaophila Avith respect to its wing-formula but a Petoccm 

 in other respects. Therefore I have no alternative but to combine 

 the two groups into one. This results in a generic, or supjjosed gen- 

 eric, group of something more than a dozen species (not counting sub- 

 species), among which there are very great differences of coloration 

 and considerable differences of form; but unless several subdivisions 

 be recognized it seems necessary to consider them all as belonging to 

 one genus. 



The genus Aiongphila, thus enlarged, includes five more or less well- 

 defined groups, as follows: 



(a) Aimophila rufescens (with its three subspecies), A. mcleodii, A. 

 notosticta, and^. rnficejps (with subspecies), of plain coloration, streaked 

 brownish above and plain dull whitish or otherwise light colored beneath. 



(S) A. ruficauda (with two subspecies), A. humeralis, and A. 

 mystacalis; a not very homogeneous group, the structual differences, 

 while not of a positive character, being well defined. This group is 

 characterized by a very bold and striking style of coloration, 

 involving conspicuous black and white head-stripes, broad back jugu- 

 lar band, black throat-patch, or other very prominent markings. 



(c) A. sumichrasti and A. carpalis, in coloration somewhat interme- 

 diate between the above two groups, having the generally plain colo- 

 ration of a but with a-ufous lesser wing-coverts, and more of the 

 form of species belonging to h. 



(d) A. quinquestrtata alone. This has the bold coloration of species 

 of group i, but is wholly unstreaked, the colors themselves quite 

 different, the bill very slender, and the tail relatively much shorter. 

 This species I once placed in Am2)hispi2a, but I now find it whoU}^ out 

 of place there unless that genus also be merged into Aimojyhila, which 

 I feel sure would be going quite too far. 



(e) Awnophila CBstivalis (with its subspecies), A. hotterii, A. sartorii^ 

 and A. pefenica, these being the species constituting the genus Peiiccea, 

 if such genus be recognized, except the last, which in that event 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 233 



would, on account of its wing-formula, have to be referred to Almo- 

 ph-i'ki, in a section hj itself. 



However distinct these groups may appear at first sight, they seem, 

 nevertheless, to be connected; thus, ^1. notostida, while a member of 

 group a as to coloration agrees best in form with members of group 

 h, particularly in its verj' long tail. The two species composing 

 group c, while resembling one another so closel}^ in coloration as to 

 leave no doubt as to their close relationship, differ verj' much in form, 

 A. sumichmsti having the short, stout tarsus of group I, while A. 

 carpaliH is unique in the shortness and relative depth of its bill. A. 

 quinquefftriafa is very much like A. ruficeps of group a in general 

 form, but has relatively longer primaries than any other member of 

 the genus, except those of the PeuccBa group, though the wing- 

 formula does not agree with that of the latter. 



Four South American (Peruvian) sparrows have been referred to 

 Aimophila, but ai'e undoubtedlj^ distinct geneiiically. as I ha\e been 

 able to determine bj' examination of three of them {Hcmnoj>hila nfolz- 

 manni Taczanowski, U. personata Salvin, and II. lata Salvin. These, 

 together with H. fuJclwa Sclater, belong to two genera peculiar to 

 the highlands of Peru, related to Aimophila and Junco, but distinct 

 from either.^

 dull black, these black streaks broadest on the back, where more or 

 less edged with rusty brown (unless edges of feathers are worn off), nar- 

 rowest, and more suffused with brown on hindneck; edge of wing light

 20.07) and with more rounded wing (ninth primary shorter than 

 third). 



Adult female (type, collection Salvin and Godman, pine ridge of 

 Poctum, Guatemala, March, 1862). — Above dark brownish gray or 

 hair brown, everywhere broadly streaked with black, the median por- 

 tion of the feathers being of the latter color, the edges (and on scapu-

 brownish, the darker centers to feathers mostly concealed; edge of 

 wing light yellow; tail brownish dusky, the feathers edged with 

 lighter; lores, narrow orbital ring, malar stripe, chin, throat, and

^ Two adult males in the collection of Messrs. Salvin and Godman from El Yolcan, 

 Chirtandega, Nicaragua (April 28), 1 refer somewhat doubtfully to this form. They 

 are larger and slightly different in color, but this may result from the fact that both 

 are in very good plumage, while the type, from Huatusco, and all the Palenque 

 specimens are decidedly worn. Measurements are as follows:

 Northern Guatemala (Peten district). 



Ainuyphila iotterii petenica resembles very closely at first glance 

 darker-colored examples of the South American Myospiza 'iiuDiimhe 

 (Lichtenstein), but differs very much in structural characters, the wing 

 being much more rounded (ninth primary shorter than third, instead 

 of longer than fourth), the tail strongly rounded, almost graduated, 

 instead of moderately double-rounded, the tarsus much shorter, and the 

 toes relatiyelj^ longer. The coloration is verj' much the same, but A. 

 1). petenica is considerably darker, both above and below, has the rump 

 and upper tail-coverts heavily spotted with blackish, has the wing 

 edge paler yellow, and lacks entirely an}^ yellow above the lores. 



The resemblance to A. I>. sartorii, from Vera Cruz and Chiapas, is 

 still closer, the coloration being practicallj' identical, and I strongly 

 suspect that when a series from the Peten district shall have been com- 

 pared it may not be possible to maintain the distinctness of the two 

 supposed forms. (See comparison of measurements on page 260.)

Genus AMPHISPIZA Coues. 

 Amphispiza Coues, Birds Northwest, 1874, 234. (Type, Emberiza billneata Cassin. ) 



Small terrestrial Fringillidse, with the tail shorter than the wing but 

 more than three times as long as tarsus; outermost (ninth) primary 

 not shorter than third; primaries exceeding secondaries by much more 

 than length of exposed culmen, and color plain gray or grayish brown 

 above, with or without narrow black streaks on back, the under parts 

 mostly white, with or without black throat-patch. 



Bill small (exposed culmen not more than half as long as tarsus, 

 depth at base less than length of gonys and little, if any, greater than 

 its width) ; culmen nearly straight, but faintly convex terminally and 

 basally; gonys straight or very faintly convex, shorter than maxilla 

 from nostril; maxillaiy tomium nearly straight, but very faintly con- 




262 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



vex subbasally and concave anteriorly, without subterminal notch, the 

 slightly deflected rictal portion nearly or quite concealed by loral 

 feathers; mandibular tomium nearly or quite straight to the subbasal 

 angle, where moderately deflected. Nostril small, roundish, in ante- 

 rior end of nasal fossae; rictal bristles rather distinct. "Wing rather 

 long (about three and a quarter to three and a half times as long as 

 tarsus), slightly rounded (ninth primary equal to fourth or third, 

 eighth to fifth quills longest); primaries exceeding secondaries by 

 decidedly more than length of exposed culmen; tertials not longer than 

 secondaries. Tail rather long (nearly equal to wing, a little more than 

 three times to more than three and a half times as long as tarsus), 

 rounded or double-rounded (difl'ei'ence between longest and shortest 

 rectrices not more than length of maxilla from nostril), the rectrices 

 broad and rounded at ends. Tarsus decidedly longer than middle toe 

 with claw, its scutella distinct; lateral claws falling decidedly short 

 of base of middle claw; claws all normally curved, strong, the hind 

 claw a little shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Plain gi-ayish or grayish brown above, the back some- 

 times narrowlj' streaked with black; tail blackish, the outermost retrix 

 usually with more or less conspicuous white or otherwise light-colored 

 edging, sometimes with a white spot at end of inner web; underparts 

 white medially, the chin, throat, and chest sometimes black. 



Although I at one time referred several Mexican species to this 

 genus, I am now satisfied that only one species besides the type can 

 properly be referred to it. A. helli (with its several geographic 

 forms), while agreeing with the type species in the lengthened wing- 

 tip and most other characters, has the wing relatively shorter and tail 

 longer than in ^1. hilMieata, the wing being but little more than three 

 times as long as the tarsus, instead of more than three and a half times 

 as long. It is a more terrestrial bird, and carries the tail elevated at 

 a considerable angle. 



Considerable doubt attaches to the position of " Zonotriclvia''' quin- 

 queatriata, which some authors (myself among the number) have placed 

 in Ainphispiza. Its style of coloration so strongly resembles that of 

 A. hilineata that it seems almost unreasonable to place it in a different 

 genus, but the wing-formula certainly agrees much better with that of 

 Aimophila, the outermost (ninth) primary being shorter than the first, 

 instead of equal to or longer than the third. Should it be finally 

 decided to place this species in Ampliixjjmi., the generic characters of 

 the latter would of course have to be modified in order to admit it.

 San Diego, and Los Angeles counties), and south throughout Lower 

 California' and into Mexican States of Sonora and Chihuahua (Casas 

 Grandes). 



'Seven specimens. ''Nine specimens. 



'Lower California specimens are aoubtfully referred to this form. The thirteen 

 adult examples from the peninsula examined, including several from Cerros, Santa 

 Margarita, and Carmen islands, are unfortunately in very bad condition of plumage, 

 and therefore do not admit of satisfactory comparison with those from other districts. 

 Average measurements compare as follows: 



While local distinction is strongly indicated by the above measurements, a much 

 arger series will be required from the different localities to determine the question.

I am unable to satisfactorily determine the status of the specimens from Santa 

 Rosalia Bay, owing to insufficiency of the series. They certainly are not A. b. cinerea, 

 being much too dark for that form; at the same time they are slightly paler and 

 grayer than true A. bellii, and have the wing and tail decidedly longer than the 

 average of those of that form.

Genus JUNCO Wagler. 



Junco Wagler, Isis, 1831, 526. (Type, /. phseonotus Wagler.) 



Struthus (not of Boie, 1826) Bonaparte, Geog. and Comp. List, 1838, 31. (Type, 



Emberiza hyemalis Linnaeus. ) 

 Niphiea^ Audubon, Synopsis Birds N. Am., 1839, 106. (Type, Emberiza hyemalis 



Linnaeus. ) 



Small oi? rather small semiterrestrial Fringillidse, with tail nearly 

 (sometimes quite) as long as wing, double-rounded; coloration of adults 

 plain, without streaks (except on back in a single aberrant species), 

 with lateral tail-feathers more or less white (except in the aberrant 

 species mentioned). 



1 "Name from Ni ipo?, snow." 




272 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Bill rather small (exposed culmen not more than half as long as tarsus, 

 usually less), conical, its basal depth decidedly less than length of max- 

 illa from nostril and much greater than its basal width; culmen dis- 

 tinctly ridged, faintly convex throughout, or with middle portion 

 straight or even faintly depressed; gonys very faintly convex or nearly 

 straight, much greater than basal depth of bill; maxillary tomium with- 

 out subterminal notch, nearly straight or just appreciably concave 

 anteriorly, faintly convex posteriorly, the basal deflection very slight 

 and mostly concealed by rictal feathers; mandibular tomium straight 

 to the subbasal angle, where slightly deflected. Nostril small, longi- 

 tudinally oval, nearly concealed by bristly plumelets (except in J. vul- 

 cani). Wing rather long (a little less than three to more than four 

 times as long as tarsus), moderately rounded (eighth to sixth primaries 

 longest, ninth shorter than fifth to third); primaries exceeding second- 

 aries by much less (usually about half) length of tarsus. Tail rather 

 long, usually a little shorter than wing, sometimes {J. hairdi) equal to 

 wing, double-rounded, with lateral rectrices about equal to the middle 

 pair or a little longer, the rectrices rather narrow, with tips slightly nar- 

 rower and rounded or obtusely pointed, about half (a little more or 

 less) overlaid bj^ upper coverts. Tarsus moderate (a little more than 

 one-fourth to about one-third as long as tail), its scutella fairly distinct; 

 middle toe with claw decidedly shorter than tarsus; lateral claws not 

 reaching to base of middle claw; hallux about equal to inner toe, its 

 claw nearly or quite as long as the digit. 



Coloration.- — Adults plain grayish above (back streaked only in J. vul- 

 cani), but back sometimes rufescent and head sometimes black; under 

 parts plain grayish with whitish abdomen, the sides sometimes pinkish 

 or cinnamomeous, the chest and throat sometimes black; lateral tail- 

 feathers largely white (nearly or quite obsolete in J. vulcani), and wings 

 sometimes with two narrow white bands. Sexes essentially alike. 

 Young conspicuousl}' streaked both above and below. 



Hange. — Boreal Province of North America, including boreal 

 "islands" south to northern Georgia, Mexico, Central America (Gua- 

 temala and Costa Rica), and Lower California. 



The only species here referred to Junco that can be considered at all 

 aberrant is J. vulcani., which differs from all the others in its conspicu- 

 ously streaked back, almost complete absence of white on lateral rec- 

 trices, and comparatively short wing and tail. But even including 

 J. vulcani, which is far out of place in any other recognized genus, 

 Junco is a much more homogeneous group than Spizella, or indeed than 

 most recognized genera containing an equal number of species.

 are simply hybrids and not true "intergrades."

'This type specimen, which I have t^arefully examined and compared, is No. 7046 of 

 Mr. Brewster' s collection, and was taken by Mr. Brewster at Colorado Springs April 26, 

 1882. It is very nearly typical of J. hyemalis, with sides only slightly tinged with cinna- 

 momeous and the back slightly brownish. It may be a young female, of the preced- 

 ing year, of /. hyemalis; at any rate it has nothing to do with the form of /. oreganus 

 (J. 0. shufeldti) , to which the name connectens was unadvisedly applied by action of the 

 A. 0. U. Committiee in 1896. 



^ Although of the several specimens considered by Professor Baird to represent his 

 /. annectens all but one represent /. mearnsi, it is nevertheless easy, in view of the 

 characters most prominently mentioned in the diagnosis, to determine which should 

 be considered as the type. For instance, the phrase ' ' whole interscapular region . . . 

 light chestnut rufous," found in the description, applies only to no. 11164, an adult 

 male from Fort Bridger, obtained April 12, 1858, all the other specimens then in the 

 Smithsonian collection having the interscapular region hair brown, very different 

 indeed from chestnut-rufous. The remarks which follow the description are, so far 

 as they apply to the color of the back, equally convincing, for it is distinctly stated 

 that the coloris "that of canirepK, not of oregonus," the back of J. mearnsi being even 

 less rufescent than that of J. oreganiLs.

WHITE -WINGED JUNCO. 



Admit male. — Head, neck, che.st, sides, flanks, and upper parts plain 

 slate-gray, darker (slate color) on the head; middle and greater wing- 

 coverts usually tipped with white, forming two distinct bands; three 

 outermost tail-feathers whollj' white, the third sometimes with a little 

 dusky, the fourth with more or less of white; length (skins), 156.97- 

 169.93 (163.83); wing, 81.53-92.96 (88.65); tail, 75.18-78.74 (76.4.5);

 (8.13); tarsus, 20.83-21.84 (21.34); middle toe, 13.72-14.99 (14.48).' 



Adult femahi. — Similar to adult male, but rather paler gray, the 

 upper parts (especially back) tinged more or less with light grayish 

 brown, the wing-bands usually less distinct, frequently obsolete, and 

 the third tail-feather more often with a little dusk}-; length (skins), 

 149.61-168.15 (159.26); wing, 81.03-84.33 (82.55); tail, 71.12-76.20

 (20.57); middle toe, 13.21-14.99 (13.97).' 



Winter birds, especially young, are more or less tinged with light 

 grayish brown, especially on back. In some adult males the tertials 

 are edged with white. 



Breeding in Wyoming (Bear Lodge Mountains) and western North 

 Dakota (Black Hills); migrating in winter to Colorado and western 

 and middle Kansas, casually to Indian Territory (Caddo) and Wiscon- 

 sin (Jefferson).

YoniKj. — Pileuni and hindneck grayish brown streaked with black- 

 ish; back and scapulars more rufescent brown (incliring to prout's 

 brown) streaked with black; throat, chest, sides, and flanks dull pale 

 butty streaked with blackish, the streaks broader and more or less 

 wedge-shaped on chest; otherwise essentially like adults. 



[Winter adults are like summer birds, but the colors are deeper or 

 richer, especially in the male, in which the back is rich vandj-ke brown, 

 sharply contrasted with the deep blackof the hindneck, and the feathers 

 •of chest are more or less tipped (narrowly) with whitish. 



Younger birds in winter are like adults, but the hiales, at least, have 

 the difl'erently colored areas less sharply contrasted.] 



Breeding from extreme northern end of British Columbia (Port 

 Simpson, etc.), north along Alaskan coast, including islands, to Yaku- 

 tat Bay; accidental on Unalaska (one specimen, April 8, 1879), and on 

 outer Iliasik Island, near Belkofski, Alaska Peninsula (one specimen, 

 January, 1889);^ in winter, south along the coast to Santa Cruz and 

 San Mateo counties, California, occasionally straggling to the interior 

 (FortKlamath, e. Oregon, October; West Humboldt Mountains, Nevada, 

 October).

Fringilla pusilla Wilson. ) 

 Spinites^ Cabanis, Mus. Hein., i, April, 1851, 133. (Type,- Fringilla socicdis 



Wilson.) 



Small arboreal or semi-arboreal sparrows with small bill, long emar- 

 ginate or double-rounded tail, and back conspicuously streaked. 



Bill small (exposed culmen usually less than half as long as tarsus, 

 never much more), conical, much deeper than broad at base; depth at 

 base less than length of maxilla from nostril; culmen slightly convex 

 terminally and basalh^ straight or faintly depressed between; gonys 

 straight, about equal to basal depth of bill ; maxillary tomium without 

 subterminal notch, faintly concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly, 

 the basal deflection nearly or quite concealed by rictal feathers; man- 

 dibular tomium straight or slightly concave to the subbasal angle. 

 Nostril small, triangular (apex forward) or linear, only the anterior 

 portion exposed. Wing rather long (about three and one-fifth to four 

 and one-third times as long as tarsus), rather pointed (eighth to fifth 

 primaries longest, ninth shorter than sixth); primaries exceeding 

 secondaries usually by decidedly less than length of tarsus (by a little 

 more in S. socialis). Tail variable in proportionate length (decidedly 

 shorter than wing in nnonticola and socialis^ nearly as long in pusilla 

 and Ireioerl, and decidedly longer in atrogularis), deeply emarginated, 

 with the lateral rectrices nearly longest {socialis); double-rounded with 

 lateral feathers much shorter than the middle pair {atrogularis), or 

 intermediate (other species), the rectrices narrow, obtusely pointed at 

 tips, less than half overlaid by upper coverts. Tarsus moderate (usu- 

 ally more, rarely less, than twice as long as exposed culmen), its 

 scutella distinct; middle toe with claw slightly shorter than tarsus; 

 lateral claws not reaching to base of middle claw; hallux nearly equal 

 to inner toe, its claw shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Back and scapulars brownish, streaked with black; 

 lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts plain grayish or grayish 

 brown, or else very indistinctly streaked; greater wing-coverts (and 

 usually middle coverts also) tipped, more or less distinctly, with white 

 or light brownish; lower parts plain whitish, grayish, or pale brownish 

 (belly always white) in adults, streaked with dusky in young (except 

 S. atrogularis).

SPIZELLA SOCIALIS SOCIALIS (Wilson). 

 CHIPPING SPARROW, 



Adult male. — Pileuui deep cinnamon-rufous to rufous-chestnut, the 

 forehead, more or less extensively, black divided by a more or less 

 distinct median streak of whitish; a broad superciliary stripe of white 

 or very pale gray, margined below by a conspicuous loral and post- 

 ocular streak of black, the latter extending beyond the auriculars and 

 more or less expanded and broken terminally ; auricular and suborbital 

 regions, sides of neck, and hindneck, gray, the last more or less streaked 

 with blackish; back and scapulars light broccoli brown or drab liroadly 

 streaked with black, the black streaks edged, more or less broadlj', 

 with rusty brown; rump and upper tail-coverts deep oli\'e-gray or 

 mouse gray, the latter somewhat darker medially; tail dusky, the 

 rectrices edged with light gray; lesser wing-coverts mouse gray with 

 darker centers; middle coverts dusky, broadly margined terminally 

 with white or buffy, forming a more or less distinct band; greater 

 coverts dusky, edged with pale wood bi'own or buffy brown, usually 

 passing into whitish or pale buffy at tips of feathers; tertials dusky, 

 broadly edged with wood brown or pale buffy brown; primaries dusky, 

 narrowly edged with pale grayish; under parts white, or grayish white, 

 the chest, sides, and flanks more or less strongly shaded with pale gray;' 

 bill black; iris brown; tarsi pale brownish, toes darker; length (skins), 

 118.62-127.00 (124.21); wing, 67.31-T1.12 (69.09); tail, 63.34-59.69 

 (56.90); exposed culmen, 8.89-9.65 (9.40); depth of bill at base, 5.33- 

 5.84(5.59); tarsus, 15.7.5-16.76 (16.26); middle toe, 11.18-12.46 (11.68).' 



Ad/iilt female. — Similar to the male and frequently not distinguish- 

 able, but usually (?) with the rufous pileum slightly less extended and 

 often more or less streaked with dusky;'' length (skins), 114.81-132.84 

 (122.68); wing, 63.26-71.37 (67.06); tail, 61.05-59.69 (54.61); exposed

 have the colors duller, the markings less sharply contrasted, the gray 

 less pure, the chestnut pileum more or less obscured b}- buffy tips to 

 the feathers, and the bill cinnamon-brownish, paler on the mandible.) 



'Very rarely there is a dusky or chestnut submalar streak. 

 ^ Nine specimens. 



^Many adult males also show more or less of this dark streaking, but apparently 

 not so many in proportion as among females. 




312 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Immature {young in first 'lointer). — Essentially like adults, but col- 

 oration much duller, the pileum light buffy brownish, more or less 

 tinged or mixed with rufous-chestnut, distinctly streaked with black, 

 and with a more or less distinct median stripe of paler brownish 

 buffy; superciliarjr stripe dull light grayish buffy, and other portions 

 of sides of head stongly tinged with the same; gray of chest, etc., also 

 tinged with grayish buffy; wing-bands strongly buff'y, broader than in 

 adults; maxilla deep brownish, darker at tip; mandible paler brownish. 



Young. — Upper parts essentially as in the immature plumage, but 

 pileum more broadly streaked with black and without trace of rufous, 

 and rump more brownish and more or less streaked with dusky; chest 

 and sides distinctly streaked with grayish dusky. 



Eastern United States and British Provinces, west to the Great 

 Plains; breeding from near the Gulf coast northward to Nova Scotia,

Specimens from the Pacific coast district (southern California to British Columbia) 

 average decidedly smaller than those from the Rocky Mountain district, but in the 

 absence of any obvious color differences I hesitate to separate them. Averages of 

 two series are as follows: 



^ Owing to insufficiency of material, especially breeding birds, from the middle

Adults {sexes alike). — Pileum rust}^ brown (intermediate between 

 russet and cinnamon-rufous), sometimes with more or less of an indi- 

 cation of a median stripe of grayish (this rarely distinct) ; sides of head 

 light gi'ay (smoke gray or olive-gray), relieved bj" a rusty brown post- 

 ocular streak; back and scapulars rusty brown, narrowly streaked with 

 black, often streaked also (on edges of feathers) with light dull buflfy 

 or clay color; rump and upper tail-coverts light brown, or hair brown, 

 sometimes indistinctly streaked with darker; tail deep hair brown, the 

 rectrices edged with pale grayish; larger wing-coverts and tertials

' Thirteen specimens. 

 Specimens from southern California and Lower California appear to average smaller 

 than those from Mexico, and as a rule have the lores less decidedly black; but so far 

 as color-differences are concerned these seem too alight and inconstant to warrant 

 subdivision of the species. Average measurements of the series examined are as 

 follows: 



Should it eventually prove desirable to separate a Californian subspecies the name 

 Spizella atrogularis evura (Coues) may or may not be available; for, notwithstanding 

 citations of "Spizella evura Coues, Ibis, 1865, pp. 118, 164" would seem to indicate 

 that the name was first published there, reference to the volume cited shows that, 

 while the bird was really described on page 118, no name was given it on that 

 page nor any other! In 1866 (Proc. Ac. Nat. Sci. Phila., p. 87) Dr. Coues gives the 

 name in the synonymy of S. atrogularis, not, however, as a new name, but as a syno- 

 nym of S. atrogularis, and cites the "Ibis" as above. The name has, therefore, a 

 very peculiar status, and, being essentially a nornen nudum, is probably not available 

 for the northwestern birds should it be found desirable to separate them.

 BREWER'S SPARROW. 



Resembling S. pallida, but more narrowly and uniformly streaked 

 above, especially the pileum, which is without any median stripe; the 

 sides of head also much more uniform.

 but never conspicuously, grayer medially), narrowly streaked with 

 black; hindneck similar but somewhat grayer and, usually, less dis- 

 tinctly streaked; back and scapulars similar to pileum but black streaks 

 broader; rump and upper tail-coverts similar to back but streaks much 

 less distinct, sometimes obsolete on rump; tail dark grayish brown, 

 the rectrices edged with pale grayish brown or brownish gray; lesser 

 wing-coverts light grayish brown with dusky centers; middle coverts 

 dusky, broadly margined on outer webs and tipped with pale dull buflfy, 

 forming a more or less distinct band; greater coverts dusky margined 

 with pale grayish brown becoming still paler (dull buffy whitish) at 

 tips; te]:tials dusky with broad edgings of pale wood brown or brown- 

 ish buflfy to outer webs; primaries grayish dusky, narrowly edged with 

 pale brownish gray; a broad superciliary stripe of pale grayish buflfy, 

 not conspicuously contrasted with color of pileum or auricular region, 

 the latter very little darker or browner than the superciliary stripe, 

 margined above by a dusky postocular streak and below by a much 

 less distinct (sometimes obsolete) rictal streak of dusky or grayish 

 brown; malar region dull whitish; under parts dull whitish, shaded 

 across chest and along sides with pale grayish buffy or buffy grayish; 

 bill brownish, dusky at tip, the mandible decidedly paler than maxilla;^ 

 iris brown; legs and feet light brown.^ (Autumnal and winter adults 

 are similar to summer specimens, but slightly more buffy.) 



Young in first winter. — Similar to adults, but decidedly more buffy 

 above, with tips of middle and greater wing-coverts decidedly buffy. 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but less sharply streaked above; 

 chest streaked with dusky, and middle and greater wing-coverts 

 broadly tipped with pale buffy, producing two distinct bands. 



'In life, the bill pale lilaceous-brown, darker at tip and along culmen; sometimes 

 the maxilla blackish, with pale commissure, the mandible lilac-grayish. 

 ^In life, varying from pale brownish flesh color to grayish horn color.

Genus ZONOTRICHIA Swainson. 



Zonotrichia Swainson, Fauna Bor.-Am., ii, 1831, 493. (Type, by elimination, 



Emberiza leucophrys Forster. ) 

 Zonitrichia (emendation ?) Bonaparte, Saggio, etc., 1832, 141. 



Rather large semi-arboreal Fringillidse, with the tail nearly or quite 

 as long as the wing, rounded or slightly double-rounded, the wing rather 

 long and pointed (eighth to sixth, or seventh to fifth, primaries longest), 

 the back conspicuously streaked with blackish, and (in adults) pileum 

 either wholly black or with two broad black bands inclosing a white, 

 gray, or partly yellow median band. 



Bill small (exposed culmen about half as long as tarsus, more or less), 

 compressed-conical (basal depth about equal to length of gonys, 

 decidedly greater than basal width) ; culmen slightly convex terminally 

 and basally, straight or faintly depressed in middle; gonys straight, 

 faintly convex terminally ; maxillary tomium faintly concave anteri- 

 orly (subterminal notch obsolete or wanting), then faintly convex, the 

 faintlj^ deflected basal portion nearly concealed by rictal feathers; 




330 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



mandibular tomium straight nearly to the slightly produced subbasal 

 angle. Nostril small, longitudinally oval, in triangular fossae, nearly 

 concealed by small bristly feathers. Rictal bristles fairly developed, 

 but very fine. Wing rather long (a little more than three to more 

 than three and a half times as long as tarsus), rather pointed (eighth 

 to sixth or seventh to fifth primaries longest, the ninth shorter than 

 fifth or fourth); primaries exceeding secondaries by decidedly less 

 than length of tarsus. Tail nearly as long as wing or slightly longer, 

 slightly rounded or double-rounded with the lateral rectrices shorter 

 than middle pair, less than half hidden by upper coverts. Tarsus 

 moderate (about one-third as long as tail or less), its scutella distinct; 

 middle toe with claw shorter than tarsus or (in Z. alhicollis) about as 

 long; lateral claws scarcely reaching to base of middle claw; hallux 

 shorter than lateral toes, its claw a little shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Adults grayish or brownish above, the back conspicu- 

 ously streaked with chestnut-brown or dusky, the wings with two 

 white bands; pileum with two broad lateral stripes of black inclosing 

 one of white or yellow, or else wholly black; under parts whitish, 

 becoming grayish on chest, or else throat black, the sides with or 

 without streaks. Young streaked above and below; in first winter 

 like adults, but with the black and white head-stripes replaced by simi- 

 lar ones of chestnut-brown and buffy, or dark rusty brown (black 

 streaked) and olive-grayish, or else crown chiefly olive-yellowish, or 

 black scaled with buffy grayish. 



Z. alhicollis differs from all the other species of this genus in its 

 much rounded wing (seventh to fifth instead of eighth to sixth, pri- 

 maries longest, the ninth shorter than fourth instead of longer), and 

 in having the tail equal to or slightly longer than the wing. Z. coro- 

 nata has a relatively longer tarsus than the other species. 



Range. — North America; breeding in the Boreal Province, including 

 most of its southern "islands," especially in western United States; 

 south into Mexico in winter.

Pacific coast and Bering Sea districts of North America; breeding 

 on the Shumagin Islands, Alaska Peninsula, Kadiak, and more western 

 parts of the Alaskan mainland, including the shores of Bristol Bay, 

 Norton Sound, and Hotham Inlet (north to Kotzebue Sound), and 

 south ^ at least to the summit of White Pass and highlands about Lynn 

 Canal and Glacier Bay; migrating southward in winter through south- 

 fern Alaska, British Colmnbia, Washington, Oregon, and California, 

 to the San Pedro Martir Mountains, Lower California, the Santa Bar- 

 bara Islands, and (casually) Guadalupe Island; occasional straggler 

 eastward (West Humboldt Mountains, Nevada, October; Colorado, 

 winter; Racine, Wisconsin, 3 specs., fall, 1854 and 1855, spring, 1856). 



^ Seven specimens. 



^ There are two alleged breeding records for California, but these are both almost cer- 

 tainly erroneous, and belong probably to Z. Uucoplirys nutlaUi. They are: Heermann,

 posteriorly}, divided medially by a line or narrow stripe of white; a 

 broad superciliary stripe bright yellow anteriorly (from bill to above 

 eyes), white posteriorly: a broad postocular streak of black; auricular 

 and suborbital regions plain gray; lores paler gray; a conspicuous 

 patch covering chin, upper throat and greater part of malar region 

 white, margined above by a more or less distinct rictal streak of

 (paler than that on sides of head) of lower throat and chest, which 

 passes into a more brownish hue on sides and flanks, the latter more 

 or less streaked with grayish brown; breast, abdomen, and under tail- 

 coverts white, the latter with pale brown central (concealed) spaces;

Genus BRACHYSPIZA Ridgway. 



BrachyspizK Ridgway, Auk, xv, July (pub. Mav 14), 1898, 224. (Type, Fringilla 

 capensis Miiller.) 



Related to Melospisa Baird, but tail shorter and double-rounded, 

 tarsi longer and stouter, and style of coloration very different. 



Size rather .small (wing, 63. 50-88. 90) . Bill moderate (exposed culmen 

 more than half as long as tarsus), triangular (basal depth about equal 

 to length of gonys); culmen gently convex terminally and basally, 

 straight or faintly depressed between; gonys straight or faintly con- 

 vex, about as long as maxilla from nostril; maxillary tomium with 

 faint subterminal notch, nearly straight anteriorly, then faintly but 

 obviously convex in front of the slight basal deflection; mandibular 

 tomium straight to the very faintly toothed subbasal angle. Nostril 

 rather broad, mostly exposed. Wing rather short (a little more than 

 three times as long as tarsus), rounded (eighth to fifth primaries 

 longest, ninth shorter than third) ; primaries exceeding secondaries by 

 less than length of exposed culmen. Tail decidedly shorter than wing, 

 double-rounded, the rectrices rather narrow, with rounded tips. Tar- 

 sus long (nearly twice as long as exposed culmen, more than one-third 

 as long as tail), its scutella obsolete on outer side; middle toe with 

 claw shorter than tarsus; outer claw reaching about to base of middle 

 claw, the inner claw falling a little short of the same point; hallux 

 about equal to inner toe, its claw shorter than the digit. 



Coloration (pftlie type species). — ;Sides and top of head gray, with or 

 without black stripes; upper parts brownish, the back streaked with 

 black; wing with two narrow white bars; under parts, including throat, 

 white; sides of neck rufous, extending to sides of chest; a black patch 

 across chest, sometimes divided into two lateral spots. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to straits of Magellan. (Monotypic?) 



Notwithstanding its different style of coloration from Melospisa.,

I conbider Brachyspiza to be much more nearlj'- related to that genus 

 than to Zonofrichla, to which it has usually been referred, doubtless 

 on account of its boldly striped head. From the latter BnwJiysjpiza 

 differs, structurally, in its relatively very much shorter and more 

 rounded wing, much shorter tail, and longer tarsi; while from the 

 former it differs in its shorter tail, longer and stouter tarsi, and very 

 different style of coloration.

^ Eleven specimens, chiefly from southern Mexico (Chiapas) and Guatemala. 



^ In addition to 29 adults from Chiapas and Guatemala, the following adult 

 examples have been examined: From Costa Rica, 4 (3 male, 1 sex undetermined); 

 Chiriqui, 1 male; Panama, 1 female; Bogota, 1, sex undetermined; Quito, Ecuador, 

 2, sex undetermined; Lima, Peru, 2 males. After careful com.parison of the whole 

 series, I am unable to detect any differences which would justify a separation into 

 geographic forms, and therefore, for the present, or until a larger series from more 

 southern localities may make further subdivision necessary, consider them as all 

 representing a single form, for which the oldest name known to me is Pyrgita 

 peruviana Lesson. As a rule, specimens from Costa Rica and northward have the 

 black on the foreneck more completely coalesced than in the few Colombian, Ecua. 

 dorean, and Peruvian specimens with which I have been able to compare them, the 

 latter, in this respect, varying toward true B. cape^isis; but they nevertheless more 

 resemble Central American specimens in this character than do the examples from 

 the more eastern portions of South America.

 ing to Dr. Hartert (Ibis, 1895, 295), the single Aruba specimen examined by him 

 "has a very stout bill, but otherwise agrees entirely with those from Curasao." 




350 BULLETIN- 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Medium sized, rather small, or large Fringillidse with short, rounded 

 wing, rather long (nearly equal to or longer than wing), rounded or 

 double-rounded tail, and conspicuously streaked brownish plumage 

 (unstreaked below only in adult of M. georgiana). 



Bill variable in proportionate length and depth, but exposed culmen 

 ne^'er much more than half as long as tarsus and basal depth never less 

 than two-thirds the length of gonys nor more than length of the latter; 

 culmen gently convex for most of its extent, straight or faintly 

 depressed in middle or post-median portion; gonys straight or faintly 

 convex, nearly or quite equal to length of maxilla from nostril; max- 

 illary tomium with subterminal notch obsolete or wanting, very faintly 

 concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly, the slightly deflected basal 

 portion nearly or quite concealed by rictal feathers; mandibular tom- 

 ium straight to the subbasal angle. Nostril small, nearly circular, 

 partly concealed by bristly plumelets. Wing short (about two and 

 two-thirds to barely more than three times as long as tarsus), rounded 

 (eighth to fifth primaries longest, ninth shorter than fourth); prima- 

 ries exceeding secondaries by much less than length of tarsus (usually 

 by not more than length of exposed culmen). Tail equal to or slightly 

 longer than wing {cinerea), decidedly shorter than wing {lincolni) or 

 intermediate, the rectrices rather narrow, obtusely rounded at tips 

 (almost acuminate in georgiana), less than half overlaid by upper 

 coverts. Tarsus about equal to middle toe with claw or a little longer, 

 its scutella fairlj" distinct; lateral claws not reaching to base of middle 

 claw; hallux about equal to inner toe, its claw nearlj^ as long as the 

 digit. 



Coloration. — Above grayish, brownish, olive, or rusty, more or less 

 distinctlj' streaked, especially on the back, with darker; top of head 

 brownish, streaked with darker, and divided medially by a more or 

 less distinct grayish stripe, or else chestnut becoming black on forehead; 

 wings and tail brownish (usually more or less rusty) the former without 

 distinct light-colored bands; ear-coverts and superciliary stripe gray- 

 ish, separated by a brownish or dusky postocular streak; a whitish, 

 light grayish, or buffy malar stripe, bordered below by a more or less 

 distinct brown or dusky streak alongside of throat; lower parts mainly 

 whitish, the chest and sides usually streaked with rusty, brown, or 

 dusky. Young similar to adults, but markings less sharply defined 

 and colors more blended. 



The type-species of this genus is a bird of verj' extensive geographic 

 range, breeding throughout the temperate parts of the North American 

 continent, including the plateau of Mexico. No other bird of the 

 Nearctic Region has proven so sensitive to influences of physical 

 environment, and as a result of this plasticity of organization it has 

 become divided into a large number of geographic forms, some of 

 extensive others of very circumscribed range, the area of distribution 




BIRDS OF MIDDLE AND NORTH AMERICA. 351 



in everj' case coinciding strictlj^ with uniformity or continuity of 

 physical cond!itions. Thus the form having the widest distribution is 

 that inhabiting the Atlantic watershed, or the entire region from the 

 wooded vallej's of the Great Plains eastward, while those of most 

 limited range belong to the Pacific slope, where the topographic and 

 resultant climatic features are so varied and complicated. In Califor- 

 nia, for example, practically each distinct drainage area has its own 

 peculiar form, one being strictly limited to the salt marshes fringing 

 San Francisco Bay. From the last-mentioned point, inhabited by 

 decidedlj'^ the smallest of all the subspecific forms, northward along 

 the coast there is a gradual change, the size steadily increasing, the 

 plumage becoming first more rusty, then more sooty, and finally 

 more grayish, until the extreme limit of variation is reached in the 

 gigantic M. c. cinerea of the Shumagin and Aleutian Islands. 



In preparing the following "key" great diflScult}' has been experi- 

 enced in the attempt to characterize satisfactorily the different sub- 

 species of M. mier'ea, since however distinct these may appear from 

 one another when specimens are actually compared (and the differences 

 are perfectl}^ obvious to an unprejudiced eye) the differences are in 

 every instance comparative and therefore most difficult to formulate. 

 When size is involved the measurements of contiguous forms inosculate 

 on account of a decided average sexual difference in size, some males 

 of a smaller form exceeding, in some of their measurements at least, 

 some females of a larger form. It therefore becomes necessary to 

 compare specimens of the same sex. The chief difficulty, however, is 

 to decide as to where the line between recognizable forms should be 

 drawn, a matter requiring most careful study of the largest possible 

 amount of material and entire absence of personal bias as to whether 

 the forms recognized be few or maiiy. 



While intermediates connecting some of the forms have not actually 

 been seen by me, there can not be the slightest doubt as to their exist- 

 ence, their absence being due in everj^ case to lack of specimens from 

 intermediate localities. Between the following forms intergradation 

 may be considered as thoroughly established: M. c. rnontana and M. 

 c. fallax; M. c. rnontana and M. c. heermanni; M. c. rnontana and 

 M. c. morphna; M. c. heermunni and M. c. cooperi; 2L c. heermanni 

 and M. c. samueUs; M. c. samuelis and 3f: c. jnwilhila; M. c. 

 samuelis and M. c. cleonensis; M. c- inorphna and M. c. rvfina; M. 

 c. rvfina and M. c. caurina; M. c. caurina and M. c. l-enaie)isis; 

 M. c. kenaiensis and M. c. insignis; M. c. insignis and J/i c. cinerea. 

 Respecting the northern Pacific coast series (beginning with M. c. 

 morphia and ending with M. c. cwierea) it necessarily follows, from 

 the nature of the case, that all the forms between the two extremes 

 are themselves intermediates; M. o. rufina connecting M. c. morphna 

 with M. c. cauri7ia, the latter connecting 3r. c. nifina with 2L c. 




352 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



kenaiejisis, the latter connecting J/, a. caurina with M. c. tnsignis, 

 the last being intermediate between M. c. henaiensis and 2L e. cnwrea. 

 I have not j'et seen specimens intermediate between M. c. mdodia 

 and M. c. monfana; between M. e. fallax and M. c. riimlnris or 

 M. c. cooperi; between M. c. montana and M. c. cooperl or 2[. c. 

 sariiiteJis; between M. c. samuelis and 31. c. coopeft-l; between any 

 two of the three Mexican forms (M. c. niexicanu, 2L c. adusta, and 

 M. c. goldmani)^ nor between either of these and M. c. falla.i:., the 

 most proximate of the more northern forms. Except in the case of a 

 few, where wide deserts or other physical obstacles prevent continuous 

 distribution, there can not, however, be the slightest doubt that inter- 

 mediates will be found when specimens are collected at the proper 

 localities.

Specimens from the immediate coast of the Atlantic coast district (Long Island to

 the difference is so slight and inconstant that subspecific separation seems to me 

 unjustifiable. The average measurements of equal series of specimens from the three 

 districts are as follows:

' Thirty-nine specimens. 



^Thirty specimens. 



Specimens from the western portion of the Great Basin and adjacent portions of 

 California have the wing and tail shorter and the bill, as a rule, thicker than those 

 from the Rocky Mountain district, and are therefore not typical; but since they do 

 not differ in coloration it seems best to refer them to the same subspecies. Speci- 

 mens from the Rocky Mountain district, the western portion of the Great Basin, and 

 eastern California, respectively, average, as follows: 



Locality. 



Middle 

 toe. 



MALES, 



Fifteen adult males from Rocky Mountain district 

 Thirteen adult males from western edge of Great

Eleven adult males from eastern California

The western specimens incline in measurements toward J/, c. heermanni, but are 

 still decidedly larger (except the bill) and the coloration is decidedly paler and less 

 brown. Many specimens of this form are scarcely to be distinguished as to colora- 

 tion from the grayer examples of M. c. melodia, hut the longer wing and tail, and, 

 except among specimens from the western parts of its range, the decidedly smaller 

 and more slender bill will serve to readily distinguish them.

MELOSPIZA CINEREA MERRILLX (Brewster). 

 MERRILL'S SONG SPARROW. 



Very similar to M. c. montana but slightly darker and more uni- 

 form above, with the grayish edgings to the interscapulars and scapu- 

 lars less strongly contrasted with the darker mesial streaks, the latter 

 usually with more bi-own than black.

 depth of bill at base, 6.86-7.62 (7.11); tarsus, 22.35-23.62 (22.61);

Breeding from northern California (Shasta County, etc. , in moun- 

 tains) and through Oregon and Washington east of Cascade Mountains 

 to northwestern Idaho (Fort Sherman); in winter southward into 

 Nevada (West Humboldt Mountains), Utah (Santa Clara), Arizona 

 (Apache), and northern Sonora (Bavispe River, Dec). 



[The above name covers a series of "intergrades" between J/i c. 

 montana and M.c. morphna, and I have hesitated to recognize the sup- 

 posed form as a subspecies. The series in question certainly does not, 

 collectively, constitute a subspecies or geographic race in the same 

 sense as do the other forms here recognized. Besides being compara- 

 tively slight, the characters of the supposed race are unstable, a series 

 of breeding birds from Fort Klamath, eastern Oregon, and another 

 from Baird, Shasta County, California, containing specimens that are 

 absolutely typical of M. c. merrilli and others which are practically 

 pure M. c. montana.]

A series from San Quentin Bay and Rosario, Lower California, compares in aver 

 age measurements with a series from San Diego and northward as follows: 



The Lower California series are all in worn breeding plumage, and some of them 

 are browner than breeding birds from San Diego; but whether they are really dif- 

 ferent or not can only be decided by examination of a series in good condition of 

 plumage. »

MELOSPIZA GEORGIANA (Latham). 

 SWAMP SPAREOW, 



Adtdts [sexes alike). — Forehead black, divided hj a more or less dis- 

 tinct median line of grayish or whitish; crown chestnut, sometimes 

 more or less streaked with blackish ; occiput blackish laterally, gray- 

 ish medially; back and scapulars light brown broadly streaked with 

 black, some of the interscapulars broadly edged with dull bufly; rump 

 olive-brownish, more or less streaked with dusky; upper tail -coverts 

 more rusty brown, distinctlj' streaked with black; tail rusty brown, 

 the median pair of rectrices with a narrow median stripe of dusky; 

 exposed surface of greater wing-coverts and secondaries chestnut, the 

 concealed median portion black or duskj"; tertials black, edged on outer 

 webs with chestnut and buffy; broad superciliarj' stripe, sides of neck, 

 and hindneck gray, the last more or less streaked or clouded with 

 brown and duskj-; auricular region more brownish graj', or light 

 brownish, margined above hj a distinct postocular streak of black 

 and chestnut and beneath bj" a narrower (sometimes indistinct) rictal 

 streak of the same; malar region pale grayish or grayish white, usually 

 margined below bj" a narrow, usually broken, submalar streak of 

 dusky; chin, throat, and abdomen white, or grayish white; chest light 

 gray or brownish gray, sometimes narrowly and indistinctly streaked 

 with dusk}-; sides and flanks (especialh' the latter) tawny brown; under 

 tail-coverts buffy with central marks of dusky. 



Immature 'birds (in second year?). — Similar to fully adult birds, as 

 described above, but without the chestnut crown-patch, the pileum 

 being brown, divided by a narrow median line of olive-graj'ish and 

 broadly streaked with black. ^ 



Young in first autumn and vnnter. — Similar to supposed j^oung in 

 second year, as described above, but with the head more or less tinged 

 with yellowish (especially on supraloral and malar regions) and the 



' It is possible that some adult females never assume the chestnut crown-patch, a 

 majority of .spring specimens of that sex being in the plumage described above. 

 That the chestnut crown-patch is not a seasonal character is proven by specimens, of 

 both sexes, thus marked, which were obtained in autumn and winter. 



Winter adults are more richly colored than those obtained in spring and summer, 

 but are otherwise similar. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 383

Genus PASSERELLA Swainson. 



Passerella Swainson, Classif. Birds, ii, 1837, 288. (Type, Fringilla iliaca 

 Merrem. ) 



^ledium-sized terrestrial Fringillidee with strong, conical bill, rather 

 stout feet with strong claws (outer toe reaching to middle of subter- 

 minal phalanx of middle toe), rather long and pointed wing, and under 

 parts white conspicuously marked with triangular spots of brown, 

 dusky, or chestnut. 



Bill moderate or rather large, conical, with superior and lateral out- 

 lines nearly straight, deeper than broad at base (basal depth about 

 equal to length of maxilla from nostril), and tip acute; culmen slightly 

 convex terminally and basally, straight or faintly concave in middle; 

 gonys straight or verj^ faintly convex, its angle prominent; maxillary 

 tomium faintly concave anteriorly, abruptly deflected at base, with 

 more or less of a notch between; mandibular tomium straight to the 

 subbasal angle, the latter unusually far back. Nostrils triangular (the

apex forward), with a ))road superior membrane. Rictal -bristles 

 obvious but small. Wing rather long (about three and a half to three 

 and two-thirds times as long as tarsus), rather pointed (eighth to sixth 

 primaries longest, ninth shorter than sixth); primaries exceeding sec- 

 ondaries by less than length of tarsus; tertials not longer than sec- 

 ondaries. Tail about iive-sixths as long as wing {Ulaaa) to longer than 

 wing {megarJiyncha), very slightly rounded or double-rounded, about 

 half concealed by upper coverts. Tarsus rather long (about twice as 

 long as exposed culmen), stout, its scutella fairly distinct; middle toe 

 with claw about equal to tarsus; lateral claws reaching decidedly past 

 base of middle claw; hallux about equal to middle toe or a little shorter, 

 its claw about equal to the digit or shorter. 



Coloration. — Above brownish gray, brownish, or rusty, the upper 

 tail-coverts, tail, and wings usually much more rufescent than other 

 portions; the back (sometimes top of head also) sometimes streaked 

 with rusty ; lower parts white, more or less thickly marked with tri- 

 angular spots of brown, rusty, or dusky, especially on chest (where, 

 as well as on sides of throat, these spots are sometimes united into a 

 more or less conspicuous patch), the sides and flanks striped or broadly 

 streaked with the same color. Young not materially different from 

 adults. 



Range. — Northern and western North America (eastern United 

 States in winter). (Monotypic.)

Northern North America; .breeding from Nova Scotia, Magdalen 

 Islands, Anticosti Island, Newfoundland, northern Maine, Province of 

 Quebec, etc. , northward and northwestward to valley of Lower Ander- 

 son River, Kowak River, and Bering seacoast of Alaska (north of 

 the Alaska peninsula) ; south in winter to northern Florida and west- 

 ward to middle Texas (San Antonio, Navarro County, Kendall County, 

 etc.), and eastern base of Rocky Mountains; occasional on southern 

 coast of Alaska during migration (Portage Bay, February). 



^ These two plumages represent the extremes, as shown in only a small percentage 

 of specimens, a large majority being variously intermediate, most of them about 

 half way between. The extreme rufous phase seems to be represented only in the 

 Atlantic coast district, and is altogether wanting in Alaska and other northwestern 

 portions of the continent, where only birds representing the gray extreme occur. 

 Many specimens from the Atlantic coast are practically indistinguishable from the 

 Alaskan specimens, however, and I am therefore unable to satisfactorily distinguish 

 two geographic forma. 



^ Ten specimens. 



' Seven specimens. 



Alaskan specimens average larger than eastern examples, except as to the feet; 

 and, in view of the fact that apparently the grayest examples only occur there, it 

 may eventually become necessary to separate them. At present, however, the num- 

 ber of specimens available for comparison, especially of summer birds, is much too 

 small to warrant such procedure. Average measurements of Alaskan and Atlantic 

 coast specimens are as follows;

Shumagin Islands and Alaska Peninsula (Kukak Bay, etc.), Alaska; 

 Unalaska Island ? " 



1 Three specimens. * Two specimens. 



^ Although no Passer ella has hitherto been found on Unalaska (unless the Aoona- 

 lashka Bunting of Latham really came from there), it is not at all unlikely that the 

 present form may occur there, at least accidentally. Certainly if any form of the 

 genus does occur on that island it would be the present one rather than the Kadiak 

 form, most of the land birds of the Shumagins and Unalaska being the same, e. g., 

 Leucostide griseonucha, Passerina nivalis townsendi, Melospiza melodia cinerea, etc. 

 This form iiihabita, on the Shumagins and the peninsula, alder thickets. No alders 

 now grow on that portion of Unalaska Island within sight from the town of Una- 

 laska or its vicinity, but they may have done so formerly, or may now occur in 

 other parts of the island. At any rate, it seems better to retain the name unalasch- 

 ensis for the present form rather than to give it a new one, since the Emberiza una- 

 laschensis of Gmelin seems almost certain to have been the present form.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 399 



Genus OREOSPIZA Ridgway. 



Chlorura (not Chlorurus Swainson) Sclatee, Cat. Am. Birds, Aug. 17, 1861, 117. 



(Type, Fringilla chlorura. Audubon. ) 

 Oreospiza BiDciWAv, Man. N. Am. Birdy, 2cl ed., 1890, 439. (Type, J-'rinyilln 



chlorura Audubon.) 



Medium-sized terrestrial Fringillidte, with rather long and pointed 

 wings, rather long rounded tail (equal to or exceeding wing), the col- 

 oration greenish above (especially on wings and tail), crown rufous, 

 throat (and other head-markings) and abdomen white, chest and sides 

 gray. (Intermediate, structurally, between PipUo and Zonotrlc/iin.) 



Bill small (exposed culmen less than half as long as tarsus), conical 

 (basal depth about equal to length of gonys, very much greater than 

 basal width); culmen slightly convex terminally and basally, straight 

 or faintly depressed between; gonj^s faintly convex, shorter than 

 length of maxilla from nostril; maxillar}' tomium slightly concave ter 

 minalh', without subterminal notch, then straight to the slight basal 

 deflection, the latter partly concealed by rictal feathers; mandibular 

 tomium faintly convex terminally, then straight, to the faintly toothed 

 sub basal angle. Nostril wedge-shaped (apex foiward), exposed, with 

 broad superior scsale or horny valve. Rictal bristles minute, scarcely 

 obvious. Wing rather long (more than three times as long as the 

 rather long tarsus), rather pointed (eighth to sixth primaries longest, 

 ninth equal to or but little shorter than fourth); primaries exceeding 

 secondaries by nearly two-thirds the length of the tarsus. Tail long 

 (about equal to or exceeding wing), rounded. Tarsus long (nearly 

 one-third as long as wing), its scutella obsolete or very indistinct on 

 outer side; middle toe with claw nearly equal to tarsus; inner claw 

 reaching decidedly, the outer slightly, beyond base of middle claw; 

 hallux much shorter than lateral toes, its claw longer than the digit. 



Coloration. — Adult plain olive-green above, with rufous pileum; 

 throat-patch, malar stripe, supra-loral spot, and belly white; chest 

 ash gray. 



Range. — Mountain districts of Western United States and northern 

 Mexico. (Monotypic.) 



Oreospiza is intermediate between Plpilo and Zonotric/ua, though 

 much nearer the former, with which it agrees in its stout feet with 

 long claws, rounded tail, and form of bill. Its coloration, too, is not 

 so abnormal for Plpilo as has been supposed, every feature of color — 

 rufous cap, white throat, yellow carpal edge, and olive-green upper 

 parts — being shared by some species of that genus, though by none in 

 the same combination. The wing, however, is very different from 

 that of Plpilo, being quite the same in the relative length of the pri- 

 maries as that of Zonotrichia, that of Z. alhicollis being even more- 

 rounded. 




400 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



The necessity of removing the type of this genus from Pipilo, with 

 which it has usually been associated by American authors, has long 

 been recognized by European ornithologists. Bonapai'te placed it in 

 Khmi-ria. (==2[di>z<>ni')\ Messrs. Salvin and Godman have referred it 

 to Eiiiher»agra (i. e., Arremonops), while Dr. Sharpe has put it in 

 Aflapi'tffi. Neither Salvin and Godman nor Sharpe give any reasons 

 for their action, though evidently it was a certain resemblance (by no 

 means a close one) in coloration between Frbuj'dla cMorvni and the 

 species of Airemoricps and AtJapetes which induced them to do so. 

 If structural characters are of any value, however, F. chlorur a is far 

 more out of place in either of these two genera than in Pipilo, while 

 even in coloration, as above stated, it is not so distant from the latter 

 as might be supposed.' 



OREOSPIZA CHLORURA (Townsend). 

 okeen-taheb towhee. 



Admit male. — Crown and occiput plain rufous or cinnamon-rufous; 

 forehead and sides of head deep gray, or olive-gray, the former mar- 

 gined on each side by a white supraloral spot; a short white malar

PIPILO NIGRESCENS (Salvin and Godman). 

 PATZCtJARO TOWHEE. 



Similar to I*, macronyx virescens but occiput with more or less of a 

 cinnamon -rufous patch; sides and flanks dull graj-ish brown, olive, or 

 Isabella color (instead of cinnamon-rufous), and outermost rectrices 

 without trace of lighter terminal spots on inner webs.^ 



Adult mafe.— Length (skins), 196.85-216.15 (206.50); wing, 87.38- 



' Four specimens. 



^ Three of the four adult specimens examined have a more or less extensive white 

 throat-patch, just as in some examples of P. macronyx and P. m. virescens; one of 

 them has 'the rufous occipital patch so small as to render it exceedingly probabie 

 that in a large series some specimens would be without it altogether. An example 

 of P. m. virescens in the National Museum collection (unfortunately without locality) 

 has the occiput distinctly tinged with rufous, the centers of the feathers being of this 

 color; this rufous occipital patch is sometimes combined with a white throat-patch, 

 also in P. p. macronyx. The differential characters of P. nigrescens therefore consist 

 really only in the different color of the sidtes and flanks, which, instead of being cin- 

 namon-rufous or more or less cinnamomeous, are olivaceous anteriorly (sometimes 

 grayish next to black of chest, becoming more decidedly olive, buffy brown, or 

 Isabella color on the flanks), and in the absence of any lighter colored terminal 

 areas on inner webs of lateral rectrices. Between the more buffy sided examples of 

 P. nigrescens and the browner sided specimens of P. in. rirescens there is not, however, 

 any very great difference, and I strongly suspect that both P. macronyx and P. m. 

 virescens hybridize with P. torquatus and P. t. aUicola, these intermediate specimens 

 being the result. In other words, the present form may be nothing more than a 

 series of hybrids between P. t. alticola and /-'. in. virescens, those examples of P. 

 m. macronyx having a white throat and rufous occipital patch being hybrids between 

 the latter form and P. (. torquatus.

[I am extremely doubtful whether this supposed form can be main- 

 tained; but since the American Ornithologists' Union Committee have 

 passed it favorably I have concluded to accept this decision, without, 

 however, strongly indorsing it. The alleged characters are exceed- 

 ingly slight and by no means comparable to those which distinguish 

 most recognized subspecies, for example, the southern form of the 

 same species (J', c. se'iicula). Furthermore, the ascribed range is 

 verv unsatisfactory, specimens from a locality which should represent 

 an extreme northern form (Baird, Shasta County) being quite the same, 

 so far as I am able to discern, as true J', cj'/ssaliti. 



These observations are based on the describei-\s type and cotypes, 

 with some of the other material examined by him at the time. The 

 former are all fall (October and November) birds, in very freshh^ 

 assumed plumage, and this will, in my judgment, account, to a large 

 degree at least, for the darker coloration.]

Medium-sized terrestrial Fringillidse with long and stout feet, much 

 rounded wing, tail shorter (or at least not longer) than wing, and the 

 plumage without streaks. 



Bill moderate (exposed culmen about half as long as tarsus, or some- 

 what more), its depth at base equal to or slightly more than length of 

 gonys, and decidedly greater than basal width; culmen nearly straight 

 to near tip, where distinctly convex; gonys straight or very faintly 

 convex, a little shorter than distance from nostrils to tip of maxilla; 

 maxillary tomium first gently concave, then gently convex in mid- 

 dle portion, then concave directly in front of the decidedly but, not 

 abruptly deflected rictal portion; mandibular tomium gently convex, 

 its sub basal angle distinctlj' toothed. Wing rather short (nearly two 

 and three-fourths to about three and a half times as long as tarsus), 

 much rounded (ninth primary much shorter than secondaries, the sev- 

 enth to fifth or fourth longest) ; primaries exceeding secondaries bj^ less 

 than length of gonys. Tail equal to or shorter than wing, more or 

 less rounded, the rectrices broad and rounded at tips, less than half 

 covered by coverts. Tarsus moderate, usually shorter than middle 

 toe with claw (a little longer in M. ruh'icatum), its scutella distinct; 

 lateral claws reaching nearly or quite to base of middle claw; hind 

 claw usuallj' shorter than its digit (equal to it in 3L rubricatum). 



Coloration. — Above plain brown or brownish gray; edge of wing 

 white or 3'ellow (the latter in 3L leucotis and 2L occipitalis); occiput

rufous 01' chestnut (except in the two species mentioned and M. inysta- 

 calis); lores white (except in M. mystac(dls); under part chiefly white 

 and gray (abdomen light cinnamon in If. mystacalis) ; sometimes with 

 a black spot in middle of chest. 



Range. — Highlands of Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Peru. 



This genus embraces three distinct styles of coloration; one, includ- 

 ing live of the eight known species, characterized by having rufous or 

 chestnut on the occiput; the second, consisting of two species, having 

 no rufous or chestnut on the chiefly black head, the sides of the neck 

 and the edge of the wing being yellow; the third, represented by a 

 single species, possessing none of the above-mentioned characters, but 

 having the lores black and the abdomen light cinnamon, the two other 

 groups having both lores and abdomen white. 



The first group, embracing JZ Meneri., M. rnhi'lcatum^ M. iiarciiatum, 

 II. cahanisi, and 21. rufigenis^ exhibits, however, the extremes of 

 variation in form, M. rvhricatum (perhaps also M. Meneri, which I 

 have not seen), having verj' stout feet with strong claws (that of the 

 hallux about equal in length to its digit, and those of the lateral toes 

 reaching quite to the base of the middle claw), exactly as in the genus 

 Pipilo^ and the tail is neai'h' even. Of the other species, M. hiarciuotuhi 

 has the tail as long as the wing, the only other species agreeing with 

 it in this respect being M. mystacalis.^ The latter is unique in its black 

 lores and cinnamon colored abdomen, while M. leucotis and M. occipitalis 

 alone have yellow in their plumage and the throat black. All have 

 the black jugular spot except 3L hiarcuatum, 2L rufigenis, and If. 

 mystacalis.

 crissum rufescent; bill blackish horn color; feet pale hazel; total 

 length, 185.42; wing, 83.82; tail, 73.66; tarsus, 25.40.' 



This little known bird, according to Sclater and Salvin, is in gen- 

 eral plumage much like 21. rubricatui/i, "but is distinguishable from 

 that species by its larger size, stouter bill, and much stronger feet and 

 tarsi." It is also said to differ in the absence of any white orbital ring, 

 and in having the whole pileum, except the dusky forehead, as well as 

 the malar region, rufous.

Genus ARREMONOPS Ridgway. 



Arremonops Ridgway, Man. N. Am. Birds, 2d ed.. Mar., 1896, 434, 605. (Type, 

 Embernagra rufivir-gata Lawrence. ) 



Small or medium-sized semi-terrestrial Fringillidse with tail shorter 

 than wing; wing short and much rounded (wing- tip shorter than distance 

 from nostril to tip of maxilla.,, and outermost primary shorter than 

 secondaries); upper parts plain olive-greenish, the pileum three- 

 striped (lateral stripes brown or blacky median stripe gray or olive); 

 edge of wing yellow; under parts whitish (more or less bufl'y or 

 grayish anteriorly and laterally), without darker band across chest; 

 tail olive-green, like back and wings; superciliary stripe, and auricular 

 and orbital regions gray. 



Range. — Southern Texas to Venezuela and Ecuador. 



^ Three specimens, two of them males, the other with sex undetermined. 




446 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES JSTATIONAL MUSEUM. 



As in many species of Arremon, all those of Arremonops have the 

 upper parts uniform olive or olive-green, the edge of the wing yellow, 

 and the under parts are likewise white medially and grayish or olive 

 laterallj'. 



The various species and subspecies belonging to this genus have 

 universally been referred to Erribernagra Lesson; but the type of the 

 latter {Emberiza platennh Gmelin) is exceedingly different in struc- 

 tural and other characters. In fact, it is difficult to understand whj' 

 these birds were ever associated with E. pJatensis and at the same time 

 so widely removed (placed in another " family "! ) from their very 

 close allies, the Arremones. 



The nearest ally of Emhernagra seems to be the South American 

 genus Emhe)'izoides Temminck (type Fringilla macroura Gmelin), the 

 type-species of the two genera differing from one another hardh' so 

 much as do certain species of Ammodramus. 



Compared with the so-called EmbernagrcB of Central America, the 

 genera Emhernagra (in its properly circumscribed sense) and Emheri- 

 zoidea differ as follows: 



a. Tail shorter than wing, with feathers not narrowed at tips; ninth primary shorter 

 than first (shorter than secondaries) ; exposed culmen much more than half 

 as long as tarsus; feathers of pileum normal; pileum with three broad stripes — 

 two black or brown lateral ones and a gray median one — or else wholly black 

 or chestnut; back not streaked. 

 6. Tail dusky, in contrast with color of back; chest with a pair of lateral black 

 patches or a complete black band; auricular and suborbital regions black. 



Arremon (p. 454) 

 hh. Tail olive or olive-green, concolor with the back; chest without black patches 



or band ; auricular and suborbital regions gray Arremonops (p: 445 ) 



aa. Tail longer than wing, with feathers narrowed at tips; ninth primary longerthan 

 third; exposed culmen not more than half as long as tarsus; feathers of pileum 

 with stiffened shafts; pileum narrowly streaked, without lateral or median 

 stripes; back conspicuously streaked (except in Emhernagra olivascens). 

 b. Tail exceeding wing by much less than length of tarsus, graduated for less than 

 length of the latter; gonys decidedly more than half the length of the man- 

 dible; culmen straighter Emhernagra (extralimital) 



66. Tail exceeding wing by much more than length of the tarsus, graduated for 

 nearly half its length; gonys not more than half the length of the mandible; 

 culmen more curved Emberizoides (extralimital) 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF ARREMONOPS. 



a. Lateral crown-stripes chestnut or chestnut-brownish, sometimes streaked with 



black. 



6. Lateral crown-stripes lighter and duller brown, not sharply contrasted with the 



olivaceous median stripe. (Arremonops rufivirgatus. ) 



c. Paler and grayer, with more slender bill (depth at base not more than 7.62) ; 



flanks pale bufiy hair brown. (Northeastern Mexico and southern Texas. ) 



Arremonops rufivirgatus rufivirgatus (p. 447) 



cc. Darker and browner, with stouter bill (depth at base 8.13 or more); flanks 



deep buffy brown, approaching wood brown. (Southeastern Mexico.)

bb. Lateral erown-stripes deeper chestnut-l)ro\\ii or i-hestnut, nharply rontrasted 

 with tlie grayish median stripe. 

 c. Lateral crown-stripes uniform chestnut; anterior under parts and sides of head 

 more or less huffy. {,lrreiniiii,op,i superciliosus.) 

 d. Lateral crown-stripes and postocular stripe darker chestnut; throat and 

 sides of head more huffy than chest; under wing-t:overts brighter yel- 

 low; wings rather brighter olive-greenish. { Pacific coast of Costa Rica.)

^ Nine specimens.

^ While many specimens from the line of the Panama Railroad are typical of A. 

 conirostris as to color, many (including all of a series of nine specimens from Loma 

 del Leon, in the collection of Messrs. A. E. and 0. Bangs), are hardly distinguishable 

 from the Central American form [A. c. richmondi). Since, however, al4 these 

 Panama birds average decidedly larger than those from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, 

 thereby agreeing with typical A. conirostris, I have thought it best to refer them to 

 the latter form.

Rather small, short-and-round-winged Fringillidse, closely similar in 

 external structural details to Arremonops., but with pileum and sides of 

 head black, with or without white or gray median crown-stripe and 

 superciliary stripes; tail darker than back and wings or else bluish 

 gray or slate-gray. 



Bill moderate, conical, with nearlj' straight outlines (only the culmen 

 sometimes decidedly curved), its basal depth about equal to length of 

 gonysand decidedly exceeding the basal width; culmen nearly straight 



' Eleven specimens. ^ Eight specimens. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 455 



except terminally and basally, where gently convex, or gently convex 

 throughout; gonys straight, a little shorter than distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla; maxillarj' tomiumwith suliterminal notch indistinct or 

 obsolete, very fainth^ concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly in front 

 of the moderately abrupt but decided basal deflection; mandibular 

 tomium straight or faintly convex to the very distinctly toothed sub- 

 basal angle. Nostril small, longitudinally or obliquely oval. Rictal 

 bristles obvious but not conspicuous. Wing short (two and a half to 

 less than three times as long as tarsus), \'cry much rounded (seventh to 

 fifth primaries longest, ninth shorter than secondaries); primaries 

 exceeding secondaries by much less than length of maxilla from nostril. 

 Tail shorter than wing, much rounded, much less than half overlaid by 

 upper coverts. Tarsus long (much more than twice as long as maxilla 

 to nostril), its scutella indistinct on outer side; middle toe with claw 

 decidedly shorter than tarsus; lateral claws not reaching to base of 

 middle claw; hind claw nearly as long as its digit, strongly curved. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive, olive-green, or gra}^ the pileum 

 black with or without a median stripe of grayish; sides of head black, 

 with or without a white supra-auricular or superciliarj' stripe; beneath 

 white, shading into grayish or olivaceous laterally, the chest usually 

 crossed by a black band; edge of wing- usually yellow. Sexes alike. 



Range. — Neotropical region in general, except Antillean Subregion, 

 but chiefly developed in tropical South America. 



Notwithstanding Amnion has by common consent been referred to 

 the Tanagridfe, I can not find any essential structural difference 

 between the type {xi. silens) and the Central American sparrows 

 usually referred to JEmbernagra {=Arivrnonojj><)^ while the style of 

 their coloration is essentially the same — far more so, indeed, than the 

 similarity of coloration between the different species of certain other 

 recognized genera (e. g. , Aiinophllu and Pljjilo). A. auraiitiirostris., the 

 onlj' species found north of the Isthmus of Panama, is not very dissim- 

 ilar to the type of the genus (^i. silens) in coloration, far less so, in fact, 

 than are many of its South American congeners; but it diflers in some 

 respects as regards structural details, the bill being considerably stouter, 

 with distinctly curved instead of nearly straight culmen, and the rectrices 

 are proportionally rather broader. A. silens has a black bill, that of 

 A. cmrantiirostrh being wholly bright orange-red (fading to yellowish 

 in dried skins), while other species have the bill partly black and partly 

 orange or yellow. 



ARREMON AURANTIIROSTRIS Lafresnaye. 

 ORANGE-BILLED SPARROW. 



Adults {sexes alil'e). — Pileum black, with a median stripe of gray; 

 a rather narrow superciliary stripe of pale gray (white in middle por- 

 tion); sides of head, including malar region, and chin black; throat. 




456 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



breast, and abdomen white; a broad black band across chest; sides 

 and flanks olive, or grayish washed with olive; upper parts (except 

 pileum and hindneck) plain olive-green, varying much in shade, some- 

 times brownish or dusky; edge and bend of wing bright yellow; bill 

 light yellowish (orange or orange-red in life), partly dusky in younger 

 birds; iris brown; legs and feet varymg from deep to pale horn 

 brownish. 



Immature. — Similar to adults but colors duller, the median crown- 

 stripe more or less olivaceous, the jugular collar partly brownish, and 

 the white of under parts, etc. , more or less tinged with buff. 



Young. — Uniform sooty olive, paler on throat and abdomen.

I am unable to make out any sufficiently well defined geographic variation in this 

 species, and therefore can not recognize Mr. Cherrie's A. u.. saturatus, although the 

 material upon which the supposed subspecies was based (including the type) , together 

 with additional specimens, has been carefully examined. To a certain extent the 

 alleged difference in coloration between specimens from opposite sides of Central 

 America is apparent; but in my opinion it is not sufficiently constant to warrant 

 subspecific separation. Average measurements are as follows:

As may be seen from the above, Guatemalan specimens average decidedly larger 

 than those from more southern localities, and it is possible that with a good series of 

 specimens, with sex determined and exact locality recorded, the validity of A. a. 

 satnmtun (the type of which is from Choctum, Vera Paz) may be established.

Genus LYSURUS Ridg^Aray. 



is/mrus RiDGW AY, Auk, xv, July (pub. May 13), 1898, 225. (Type, Buarremon 

 crasdrostris Cassin. ) 



Similar to Arremon Vieillot but nostril broader, more rounded, with 

 superior operculum much less developed; wing much more rounded 

 (ninth primary ver_y much shorter than secondaries, the eighth about 

 equal to secondaries or but little longer); tail more rounded, almost 

 graduated, with the rectrices very broad, though pointed at the tips, 

 their webs semi-decomposed terminally; middle toe relatively longer, 

 the lateral claws falling much short of base of middle claw. 



Coloration. — Pileum chestnut; rest of upper parts olive-green; 

 under parts, except chin and throat, olive-green, the abdomen yellow 

 in L. crassirostris. 




458 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Range. — Highlands Costa Rica to western Ecuador. (Two species.) 

 The species which I have felt compelled to make the type of a new 

 genus has always been placed in Buai'veinon, but evidently has nothing 

 to do with the birds which properly constitute that genus. In style 

 of coloration it somewhat resembles some of the species of Atlapetea^ 

 especially those with chestnut pileum and yellow belly, which, also, 

 were formerly placed in Bnarrtiiion; but in structural characters it 

 comes far nearer to Arremon, from which its very different style of 

 coloration, more rounded wing, relatively longer middle toe, and dif- 

 ferently shaped and partially decomposed rectrices serve to readily 

 distinguish it. 



Lyswnis cctstaneiceps (Sclater) resembles Z. crassirostris in coloration, 

 except that the under parts, posterior to the throat, are wholly olive- 

 green and there are no white markings on the head. It is quite 

 identical structurallj' also, and there can be no question that the two 

 species are strictly congeneric. It belongs to eastern Ecuador and 

 Colombia (province of Antioquia).

460 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Coloration. — Above plain dusky slate, olive, or olive-green, the 

 pileum rufous or with light-colored median stripe (whole head and neck 

 sometimes rufescent); beneath yellow, or white with chin and throat 

 yellow, white, or gray; never streaked nor spotted, either [above or 

 below, except in nestling plumage. 



Range. — Mexico to Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Guiana, in high- 

 lands. 



The type of this genus is somewhat more slender, with smaller bill 

 and narrower rectrices, than the other species which I consider to be 

 congeneric with it (usually referred to the genus Bvurremon), but the 

 structural differences between A. fileatus and any of the others are 

 very insignificant compared with those between different species of 

 Aimophila., Ammodramus, Cardinalis, Pipilo, and other genera.

^Five specimens (three from southern Mexico, one each from Guatemala and 

 Costa Rica). 

 Averages of specimens from different countries are as follows: 



With a series of thirty-eight adults, representing numerous localities from southern 

 Mexico to Venezuela and Peru, I am unable to detect any color-differences that can 

 be correlated with separate geographic areas. The individual variation in meas- 

 urements is very great, ana possibly marked geographic differences in this respect 

 exist, but unfortunately the number of aexed specimens is much too small to deter- 

 mine the question. The largest specimens in the series examined are from the State 

 of Chiapas, s(.)a(hern Jlexico, a district where many species exhibit a tendency to 

 acquire unusual size; l)ut among the Chiapas specimens are some of the usual dimen- 

 sions. The smallest .specimens are from Costa Rica.

Genus PLATYSPIZA Ridg-way. 



Platyepiza Bidsway, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.,xix, no. 1116, March 15, 1897, 545. 

 (Type, Camarhynchua variegatus Sclater and Salvin, = C. crassiroslris Gould.) 



Stoutlj' built, short-tailed semiterrestrial Fringillidse with the tail less 

 than twice as long as tarsus, outstretched feet reaching to or beyond 

 tip of tail, culmen strongly convex, commissure strongly angulated 

 or deflexed basally, angle of mandibular tomium toothed, and basal 

 width of mandible decidedly greater than length of gonys. 



Bill short, deep, and broad, with culmen stronglj' convex, but gonj's 

 straight, the latter decidedly shorter than basal width of mandible; 

 maxillary tomium strongly angulated or deflexed basally; mandibular 

 tomium with its decided sUbbasal angle obviously toothed. Nostril 

 very small, circular or oval,* in anterior portion of exposed nasal 

 fossae. Rictal bristles obsolete. Wing about three times as long as 

 tarsus, rounded (ninth primary equal to or longer than fourth), the 

 wing- tip short (less than length of maxilla from nostril). Tail, short 

 (less than twice as long as tarsus), slightly rounded. Middle toe, 

 with claw, nearly as long as tarsus. 



Coloration. — Above nearly plain dull olivaceous, beneath dull whitish 

 streaked with dusky; adult males with head, neck, and chest black. 



Although I have formerly kept the type (and only known species) 

 of this genus with GamarhyncJms, I now believe that by its withdrawal 

 the latter becomes a much more natural group. There is really a very 

 great difl'erence in the form of the bill between P. crassirostris and 

 the true Oamarhynchi, an approach to that of some ,of the species of 

 Oeospiza being indicated; but the style of coloration agreeing strictly 

 with that of the typical Oamarhynchi (which never have more than 

 the head, neck, and chest uniform black, while in some species there 

 is no black whatever), Platyspiza is undoubtedly, in my opinion, 

 more closelj^ related to GcrniarhyncJms than to Geospiza} 



Range. — Peculiar to the Galapagos Archipelago. (Monotypic.) 



'I am compelled to disagree with Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert (Novitates 

 Zoologicse, vi,' 1899, 165, 166) concerning these two genera, which seem to me to be 

 clearly distinct, each showing nearly the same extreme variations in the size and 

 relative length and thickness of the bill.

PLATYSPIZA CRASSIROSTRIS (Gould). 

 DARWIN'S GEOTJKD FINCH. 



Specific characters. — Culmen strongly convex and maxillary tomium 

 strongly deflected from beneath nostril to rictus; gonys straight, 

 strongly ascending terminally, forming a decided angle with the lower 

 edge of the mandibular rami; mandible very broad at the base, where 

 its width greatly exceeds the length of the gonys; wing, 78.99-87.63; 

 tarsus, 26.67-39.21. 



AdvU male {worn plumage). — Head, neck, and upper chest dull 

 sooty blackish, broken, more or less, by paler edgings to the feathers, 

 deepest and most uniform on upper chest and median line of throat; 

 upper parts plain brownish olive, lighter and slightly more buffy on 

 the lower rump; the general color of the wings and tail somewhat 

 darker than the back, with the margins of the feathers rather lighter, 

 especially on middle and greater wing-coverts and primaries; under 

 parts, posterior to upper chest, pale creamy yellow, shaded laterally 

 with light olive-brown, the lower chest and sides of breast marked 

 with broad, more or less wedge-shaped, streaks of sooty blackish, these 

 gradually becoming obsolete on the sides; under wing-coverts white 

 tinged with pale creamy yellow, the carpo-metacarpal region with an 

 elongated space of dusky olive-grayish; bill, legs, and feet whoUj' black. 



Immature male. — Above olive, the pileum rather broadly and dis- 

 tinctly streaked with dusky, the feathers of the back and scapulars 

 with large central spots of a slightly darker and less olivaceous hue; 

 wings and tail as in the adult male; under parts very pale creamy 

 yellow, the whole chest and sides of breast with broad, mostly wedge- 

 shaped or sagittate spots of deep sooty brown or sepia, the sides and 

 flanks with narrower and less distinct streaks of the same; bill, legs, 

 and feet black. 



Young male. — Similar to the immature male, as described above, 

 but margins of wing-coverts more buflEy, spots on chest, etc. , rather 

 deeper in color, and bill light-colored (basal half of maxilla deep 

 brown, terminal half and whole of mandible pale bufl'y brownish). 



Yowng female. — Similar to the young male as described j but mark- 

 ings on breast, etc., less deep (deep hair brown).

Genus CAMARHYNCHUS Gould. 



Camarhynchus GouhB,FTOC. Zool.Soc, pt. 5, 1837, 6. {Type, C. psUtacula Gould.) 

 Cactospiza Ridgway, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xix, no. 116, March 15, 1897, 546. 

 (Type, Caclomis pallidus Sclaterand Salvin. ) 



Similar to Platyspiza but bill very different, being much more 

 compressed (basal width of tnandible not greater, sometimes less, than 

 length of gonys), with commissure nearly straight or with the basal 

 deflection much less abrupt, and the angle of mandibular tomium not 

 toothed; some of the species without any black in adult males. 



There being an almost unbroken transition, in diflEerent species, 

 from the short and stout bill of G. psittaculus to the long and narrow 

 one of C. pallidMS, while the coloration of the latter is practically 

 identical with that of those Camarhynchi of which the adult males are 

 destitute of any black areas to the plumage and consequently conspic- 

 uously different from that of the narrow-billed Gempizw (representing 

 the formerly current genus Oactornis)^ I am fully convinced that ref- 

 erence "■ of O. pallidus and the related G. productus to Gamarhynchvs 

 is correct. I am sorry to have to disagree in this matter with the 

 views of Messrs. Eothschild and Hartert,'' but the case seems so very 

 clear to me that I can see no reason whatever for changing mj^ opinion 

 as to the relationship of the species named, which evidentl}'^ bear to 

 the typical (thick-billed) species of GamarliyncTius the same relation 

 that the true Ccwtornithes do to the typical Geospizm.

Adult male unknown; adult female similar to that of C. compres-

Adult female. — Above bright buffy olive, the pileum rather dis- 

 tinctly streaked with grayish dusky, the back and scapulars more 

 obsoletely and broadly streaked or spotted with the same, entirely uni- 

 form posterior to the back, the color lighter and more distinctly huffy 



do not seem to warrant such procedure, as may be seen from the following, where

If two allied species {psittaculus and incertus) can occur together on James and 

 Duncan islands and also on Charles Island {psittaculus and pauper), I see no reason 

 why two {psiitandus and compressirostris) may not occur together on Jervis Island. 

 Without question the measurements of, the bill of C. compressirostris a,nd a Jervis Island 

 specimen of C. psittaculus differ much more than do those of the latter from the same 

 measurements of C. psittaculus from the different islands. According to the evidence 

 before me, therefore, I must continue to recognize C. compressirostris as a distinct 

 form until the contrary has been proven.

 olive, more dusky on cheeks; throat and chest dull black, broken by 

 occasional streaks of pale olive-buff, this color predominating on chin;

The bird described above is absolutely similar in coloration to C. salvim, of Chatham 

 Island, but is nearly as large as C. compresdrostris. Were these two species found 

 together on the same island, I would be disposed to consider the present bird a 

 hybrid; but manifestly this can not be the case. It is possible that a larger series of 

 specimens would run C. compressirostris and C. incertus together, in which case there 

 would be another form common to the two islands of James and Jervis; but for the 

 present I have to consider them as different. 



^ Two specimens.

CAMARHYNCHUS PROSTHEMELAS Sclater and Salvin. 

 BLACE-EEADED GROTTin) FINCH. 



Smallest form of the genus (wing not exceeding 64.77, culmen not 

 more than 11.68); similar in coloration and shape of bill to O. pauper, 

 but size much less. 



Adult male.- Head, neck, and chest uniform black, ending abruptly 

 beneath in a convex outline; rest of under parts plain buffy white, 

 tinged with olive-gray laterally; rest of upper parts olive, the feathers 

 of the back with indistinct darker centers; remiges and rectrices 

 dusky, margined with grayish olive, the edges of the outermost pri- 

 maries approaching grayish white; bill, legs, and feet entirely black. 



' One specimen. 



Although about the same size as C. psittaewlus (except that the bill is very much 

 smaller) , the relationships of this species are evidently with C. prosthemdas rather 

 than C. pnttaculus and allied forms, the bill being even more compressed and elongated. 

 In coloration the adult males resemble them about equally, there being no material 

 difference between the color of fully adult males in the various species of the group, 

 except in the case of C. salvini. 



The adult female most resembles that of C. prosthemelas, but has the chest and 

 sides darker (distinctly brownish buffy) , the former without distinct streaks, at least 

 in the single specimen examined. 



An immature bird of undetermined sex (No. 52401, U.S.N.M. ; Charles Island, 

 received from Professor Sundevall) is darker and browner above than the adult 

 female described above, has the under parts paler with distinct dusky streaks on the 

 chest, and has the bill light colored (maxilla light brown, mandible pale dull buffy). 



Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert give measurements of the "oldest birds with 

 black bills" (sexes not distinguished) in their series as follows: Wing, 69.00-73.00; 

 culmen, 12.90-13.50.

 indistinctly edged with grayish olive; rest of upper parts dull grayish 

 olive, the feathers of back dusky centrally; under parts (including 

 throat, etc.) dull grayish white, tinged with pale yellowish buff, pass- 

 ing into pale olive-brownish on sides and flanks, the chest and sides of 

 breast streaked with dusky; otherwise as in adult male. 



Young male. — Above rather light olive-gray, becoming paler and 

 tinged with buffy on rump, the pileum and hindneck broadly and dis- 

 tinctly streaked with dusky, and feathers of the back and scapulars 

 with a large, sharply defined central spot of the same; wings and tail 

 dusky, the feathers margined with light olive-grayish, paler and more 

 buffy on middle and greater wing-coverts; under parts white, very 

 faintly tinged with pale buffy, shaded on sides and flanks with pale 

 brownish buffy, and sparsely streaked across chest and along sides with

 and still more uniform above, and under parts strongly tinged with 

 light brownish buffy, especially on chest, sides, and flanks, which are 

 not obviously streaked.

Bill _slender, its depth at base decidedly less than distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla. 



Adult male. — Above ash gray, more brownish on lower back and 

 rump, the central portion of the feathers darker, especially on the 

 crown; wings and tail deep brown, with narrow edgings of grayish, 

 the inner webs of remiges and rectrices rather broadly edged ^vith 

 w;hite; under wing-coverts white, slightly tinged with yellow; under 

 parts white, slightly tinged with buff, the flanks shaded and faintly 

 striped with brown; chest more strongly tinged with brownish buff', 

 the basal portion of the feathers blackish gray; bill horn black; iris 

 brown; feet blackish. 



Adndt female {V). — Similar to the adult male, but slightly more 

 brownish and more uniform above. 



Immature m,ale and fem.ale (?). — Similar to the adult (?) female, but 

 more olive above, the under parts buffy yellowish, with lower throat, 

 chest, and sides are less streaked with dusky; ^ bill pale brownish, the 

 mandible paler knd more yellowish. 



^ Seven specimens, two of them immature.

Similar to Platyspiza but culmen much less strongly convex (often 

 nearl}^ straight for part of its length), less distinctl.y ridged; angle of 

 mandibular tomium not obviously toothed; adult males entirely black, 

 except under tail-coverts. 



Bill exceedingly variable in relative length, depth, and width, its 

 lateral outlines and gonys nearly (sometimes quite) straight, and tip 

 acute; culmen, from extreme base, less than two-thirds to quite as 

 long as tarsus; depth of bill at base less than half culmen to nearly as 

 long as culmen, but always greater than width of mandible at base; 

 culmen more or less convex (always most so basally), but sometimes 

 almost straight; the basal portion usualty strongly ridged and some- 

 times elevated and strongly arched; gonys straight or almost inappre- 

 ciably convex, decidedly shorter than length of maxilla from nostril; 

 maxillary tomium without subterminal notch, first faintly (sometimes 

 almost inappreciably) concave, then about as much convex, again 

 reentering at the beginning of the abrupt and very conspicuous basal 

 deflectiQn; mandibular tomium nearly straight or slightlj^ convex, 

 with its basal portion abruptly deflected, but the angle thus formed 

 not toothed. Nostrils very small, oval or nearly circular. Rictal 

 bristles obsolete. Wing rather short (a little more than three to nearlj"- 

 three and one-half times tarsus), rounded (eighth to sixth primaries 

 longest, ninth not longer than fifth, usually shorter); primaries exceed- 

 ing secondaries by less than exposed culmen; tertials not longer than 

 secondaries. Tail short (decidedly more than half the wing, a little 

 less to a little more than twice as long as tarsus), slightly rounded, the 

 rectrices broad, with rounded tips, about half hidden bj' the coverts. 

 Outstretched feet reaching to or beyond tip of tail; tarsus about equal 

 to middle toe with claw (sometimes a little longer or shorter), its scu- 

 tella distinct; lateral toes very long, reaching to nearly middle of last 

 phalanx of middle toe, their claws reaching to or decidedly beyond 

 the base of the middle claw; hallux shorter than lateral toes, its claw 

 nearly or quite as long as the digit.

Coloration. — Fully adult males entirely black, inclxiding bill and 

 feet, but under tail-coverts with broad whitish or buffy margins; 

 immature males, females, and young grayish brown streaked and 

 spotted with dusky above, beneath light colored with conspicuous 

 dusky streaks, the bill largely light colored (except in some adult 

 females and immature males). 



Range. — Peculiar to the Galapagos Archipelago. 



Few genera equal the present one in the extreme modifications in 

 the form of the bill, which in some species {magnirostris, utreniia, and 

 pavhyrlujnclid) is perhaps not excelled by that of any other member of 

 the family Fringillidse in its extreme thickness, in others (members of 

 the so-called genus Cactornis) slender and decurved, in others very 

 acute, with straight outlines, and in others still elevated and arched at 

 the base. The most extreme forms are, however, so gradually and 

 perfectly connected by intermediate types that there seems no possi- 

 bility of satisfactorily subdividing the genus into two or more sections. 



The reduction of Oactanns to a synonym of Geospiza has already 

 bccMi made in my paper describing the new species of Galapagos birds 

 in Dr. Baur's collection,' in which is announced "the discovery of 

 species which absolutely bridge the previously existing gap between 

 the so-called genera Geospiza and Cactornis, thus necessitating the 

 suppression of one of these names (the latter, according to the-rule of 

 prioritj^)." 



While admitting that it would be very convenient to recognize 

 Cactarn is if any definite characters could be found, I am still of the 

 opinion that not a single character can be depended on to separate 

 them. The character which comes nearest to doing so is, apparently, 

 the relative width of the mandible between the bases of the rami to 

 the length of the gonys, which is very much less in typical "'Cactornis'" 

 than in true Geospiza. This greater compression of the bill even 

 serves to trenchantly separate " Cactornis'''' propinqua. from G. coniros- 

 tr/.t, some individuals of which are almost precisely alike in the lateral 

 profile and measurements of the bill ; but the use of this character as 

 a generic one would necessitate the removal of Geospiza difficilis and 

 G. acutirostfn-s, perhaps also G. minor, to Cactornis; and it is difficult 

 to see how the group can be divided into two genera without one or 

 two more being necessary; for there is certainly more difference 

 between such species as Geospiza magnirostris and G. pachyrhyncha on 

 the one hand and G.fuliginosa, G. debilirostris, etc., on the other, than 

 between '"'' Cactornis''^ hrev i^rostr is a,nA. Geospiza _f rater cula, or het^veen 

 C. prop)inqua and G. conirostris. Furthermore, if this group be

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 491 



recognized to consist of two or more genera instead of one, uJien, to 

 be consistent, Camarhynckiis must also be divided into two genei'a. 



A very careful consideration of all the facts in the case, as they 

 appear to me, compels me to conclude that the safest course is to 

 regard the species of ^^ Cactornis''^ as simply more slender-billed 

 Oeospisce, the degree of departure from the typical Goespizine bill 

 being largely a specific character. This is a conclusion which I regret 

 having to adopt, for I regard large genera as a nuisance, and would be 

 glad to have the slighest excuse for keeping Geospiza to its old limits. 



As to the relationships of the group to which the generic name 

 Oamarhynchus Gould has been generally applied, while admitting the 

 difiiculty of formulating strongly -marked structural characters, I nev- 

 ertheless cannot follow Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert^ in referring 

 the latter to Geospiza^ for reasons explained under the head of Oamar- 

 hynchus, on page 476 of the present work. 



As a matter of convenience, I have separated the species into two 

 groups, which correspond in their limits with Cactorms and Geospiza 

 as usually recognized;^ but how slight and unsatisfactory a basis this 

 division rests upon may be seen by reference to the characters given 

 in the first part of the following "key to the species." 



Owing to the gradual transition from one form to another, and the 

 almost perfect resemblance between them in coloration, I have found 

 it impossible to construct an analytical "Icey " to the species after the 

 usual plan, but have drawn up the following as an aid to their more 

 ready identification. I am prevented from making the "key" more 

 satisfactorj' b}^ the circumstance that I have no specimens of G. 

 assiinUis and G. harringtoni for comparison with the other so-called 

 Cactorni, and am therefore unable to give comparative measurements 

 of these forms alongside of G. fatigata and G. ahingdonl. 



In another respect T am, much to my regret, compelled to dissent 

 from the conclusions of Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert. In their 

 most valuable work, already referred to, these gentlemen say'' that 

 in the case of certain genera of Galapagos Passeres (the present one 

 among the number) their "material has general^ left very little 

 doubt" whether they should "treat a form as a species or subspecies." 

 Nevertheless, their decisions in this respect are not in all cases satis- 

 factory, and in one or two cases almost certainly erroneous.* When 

 we consider that in this genus, as here restricted, the plumage is 

 always practically and in the case of a majority of the forms identic- 



» Novitates Zoologicse, vi, 1899, 152-154. 



^ With this difference: Cactcrni^ pallida Sclater and Salvin I have transferred to 

 Camarhynchus, to which it is certainly far more nearly related (see p. 476).

ally, the same, the measurements must necessarily be the only factor 

 in determining the number, limits, and relationships of the sevei'al 

 forms. Looking at the matter from this standpoint, it seems to me 

 that anj^ grouping of the various forms into species and subspecies 

 must be purely arbitrary, and almost certain to differ with different 

 persons; and I am still of the opinion, expressed on page 468 of my 

 paper,' that "were 'lumping'^ once begun there could be no end to it, 

 unless purely arbitrary limits were given to the species recognized, 

 and if followed to a logical conclusion might easily end in the recog- 

 nition of a single variable species, equivalent in its limits to the genus." 

 This observation, according to mjr views, applies with exactly equal 

 force to any attempt to segregate the forms into specific groups. There- 

 fore, it seems to me that if there ever was a case which justified the 

 avoidance of trinomials the present genus is certainly of that kind.' 



* Birds of the Galapagos Archipelago, Proc. XJ. S. Nat. Mus., xix, 1897, pp. 459-670, 

 pis. 56, 57. 



^The term "lumping" was intended to apply to the reduction of any definable 

 forms to the rank of subspecies, although the inference is not clear in the original. 



'Also the genera Camarhynchus and Certhidea. 



In order to demonstrate the extreme difficulty of satisfactorily using trinomials in 

 the present genus, I give below the average measurements (of males only) of the 

 forma recognized conjointly by Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert and myself. It is 

 true that these measurements are not absolutely correct, relatively, for I have not 

 been able to measure the very large series contained in the Tring Museum, and have 

 in some cases been compelled to use measurements taken by Messrs. Eothschild and 

 Hartert, and it is a well-known fact that no two persons can get precisely the same 

 measurements for the same individual specimen. Furthermore, in the case of Messrs. 

 Eothschild's and Hartert's measurements only the mean and not the average can in 

 some cases be given.

Among the true Geospiza', nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, constitute a fairly gradual transi- 

 tion between extremes, which becomes much more evident when the average meas- 

 urements of specimens of each form from different islands are compared, when many 

 apparent gaps are bridged over. The forms numbered 14 to 17, inclusive, do not 

 belong to the transitional series, but are "offshoots" from some of the forms com- 

 posing the latter. 



' Owing to the fact that coloration affords little or no assistance in determining the 

 various forms of this genus, a satisfactory key is hardly possible. The one here given 

 is the best that I am able to devise under the circumstances, and is offered with full 

 consciousness of its inadequacy, but with the hope that it may be of some assistance. 

 Nearly all measurements of the more nearly related forms inosculate, so that it is 

 seldom that positive characters can be derived from this source. This inosculation 

 does not, however, affect the validity of the forms in question, since they are the 

 result of individual variation in relative proportions of the different parts, the averages 

 showing decided differences. The females of many forms have not been examined 

 by me, while others are meagerly represented in the series examined, consequently it 

 has been deemed best not to attempt a "key" to them.

■'I have examined adult specimens only from Indefatigable and Barrington islands, . 

 the other islands being given on authority of Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert, who 

 refer the Barrington birds (my (!. barringtoni) to this form. As to the propriety of 

 this reference I am doubtful, since the authors mentioned admit that "the shapes of 

 the bills of the type specimen and some of the other specimens certainly look some- 

 what different, as they are plumper at the tip,'' though adding that "other speci- 

 mens again are quite like those from the other islands." The authors mentioned 

 had not been able to examine adult males from Chatham nor Duncan islands; 

 therefore, the limits of the present form and the status of the specimens from Bar- 

 rington, Chatham, and Duncan islands must remain doubtful uijtil more satisfactory 

 series have been carefully examined, measured, and compared.

 Haller and Snodgrass, Condor, iii, May, 1901, 75; Bindloe Island, Galapagos Archi- 

 pelago; Leland Stanford Jr. University callection.) 



* The Baur collection, now in the Tring Museum, contained, when I examined it, a 

 young male from James Island which certainly can not be G. scandens, the common 

 form of that island, being altogether too large and also too different in coloration. 

 While a very young bird,. its measurements decidedly exceed those of any fully 

 adult male examined of G. scandens. Although this specimen was fully described 

 by me under G. assimilis on page 538 of my "Birds of the Galapagos Archipelago" 

 (1896), it is strangely not mentioned at all, that I can find, in Messrs. Rothschild and 

 Hartert's more recent "Review." In order to call special attention to this speci- 

 men, with the view of a further attempt to determine its status, I reproduce my 

 remarks concerning it: 



"There is in Dr. Baur's collection a young male from James Island (no. 527, August 

 13, 1891), which is certainly not G. scandens, but is either G. assimilis or an unde- 

 scribed form. It is decidedly larger than any of the eight examples of G. scandens 

 with which I have compared it, the bill especially being much larger and deeper, 

 with decidedly curved culmen. These differences are the more important from the 

 fact that the. bird is a very young one, in nestling plumage. The coloration is much 

 darker than in any of the immature stages of G. scandens, the under parts being 

 mostly dark sooty grayish distinctly intermixed with whitish only on the abdominal 

 region and under tail-coverts, and the upper parts are quite uniform dark sooty, 

 except the wings, which have the usual lighter margins, though these are distinct 

 only on the middle and greater coverts. The bill is a light buffy brown, dusky at 

 the extreme tip and deeper brown basally. In coloration this James Island speci- 

 men very closely resembles a young male of corresponding age of G. abingdoni, 

 except that in the latter the maxilla is almost wholly blackish brown, and the 

 mandibular rami have a sharply defined oblique spot of the same color at their upper 

 basal portion; but the shape of the- bill is quite different, that of G. abingdoni being 

 much more slender. 



"Above uniform sooty blackish, the middle wing-coverts and remiges narrowly 

 margined with dull grayish buffy, becoming more decidedly grayish on primaries;

coverts and other features which characterize young birds in their first year. It cer- 

 tainly can not be referred to G. fatigata, which has the bill altogether longer and at 

 the same time much narrower in both its vertical and transverse diameters. The size 

 and shape of the bill agree verj' closely with those of G. brevirostris, though, as might 

 be expected from the difference in age or sex, it is not quite so strong. 



Without having seen the type, Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert refer, quite confi- 

 dently, this form to G. conirostris as a subspecies; but in doing so I feel sure they are 

 in error, having carefully reexamined the type and compared it with the smaller 

 specimens of G. conirostris (my G. media) . G. brevirostris is, in fact, far more like 

 G. frcdereula, and there is quite as good reason for considering G. brevirostris related 

 to G. fratercula as to G. conirostm, as the following measurements will show:

Exposed culmen about as long as middle toe, without claw; depth 

 of bill at base more than half the length of exposed culmen, but 

 decidedly less than length of gonys; culmen gradually curved from 

 the base, more decidedly so for terminal third; gonj^s straight, 

 decidedly shorter than length of maxilla from nostril; maxillary 

 tomium gently but decidedly concave for most of its length, the 

 rictal portion abruptly deflected; mandibular tomium strongly arched, 

 but not angulated, basally; tip of maxilla acute, without trace of 

 notch. Nostril wholly exposed, rather large, broadlj^ oval or nearly 

 circular, the surrounding membrane broadest above and behind. 

 Rictal bristles inconspicuous. Wing moderate, rounded (seventh and 

 sixth primaries longest, ninth intermediate between fourth and third), 

 the primaries exceeding secondaries by less than length of exposed 

 culmen. Tail about equal to length of primaries from tips of longest 

 primary coverts, slightly rounded, the rectrices rather broad. Tarsus 

 about one and a half times as long as exposed culmen, its scutella dis- 

 tinct; middle toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus; lateral 

 toes about equal, their claws reaching to base of middle claw; hallux 

 about equal in length to lateral toes, but very niuch stouter, its claw 

 much larger than that of middle toe. 



CoJorathon. — Adult male uniform deep (but not glossy) black, with 

 whitish margins to under tail-coverts; adult female and young olive- 

 brownish varied with dusky above, pale buily conspicuouslj- striped 

 with dusky beneath; two conspicuous deep bully or light cinnamon 

 wing-bars. 



Range. — Peculiar to Cocos Island, off Bay of Panama. (Monotypic.) 



Although this genus approaches in form of the bill the Ccerebine 

 genus Ccereba, while the adult male of the type species closed resem- 

 bles in coloration one species of the last-named genus {0. atrata), I 

 have not the slightest doubt as to its Fringilline relationships, or at 

 least its near relationship to the Galapagoan group of supposed 

 finches, among which the slender-billed Geospizce (" Cwtm^nis''^) are 

 evidently its nearest relatives. The bill is not very unlike that of the 

 Hawaiian genus Oreomyza in general form and relative size, but is 

 more decidedly decnrved, stouter at the base, and with the commissure

 U. S. Nat. Mus., Cocos Island, February 28, 1891; C. H. Townsend.) 



Adult female. — Pileum and hindneck dusky, the feathers edged with 

 light olive, producing distinct though narrow streaks; back and scap- 

 ulars with dusk}" centers and broad margins of bufiy olive; rump plain 

 buffy brownish or isabella color, the upper tail-coverts similar but 

 with rather indistinct dusk}' centers; wings dusky with more or less 

 distinct light brownish edgings, the middle and greater coverts broadh' 

 tipped with light cinnamon or dull ochi'aceous-buff, producing two 

 distinct bands; tail duskj', the feathers narrowly edged with light 

 olivaceous and narrowly tipped with light cinnamon; sides of head 

 and under parts pale j^ellowish buff, the abdomen inclining to pale 

 maize j^ellow and the flanks washed with vuHtj brownish; sides of head 

 thickly and finely streaked with dusky, especially on auricular region, 

 where the ground color is more olivaceous; chin and throat narrowlj^ 

 streaked with dusk}'; chest, upper breast, sides, and flanks broadly 

 streaked with dusky, some of the streaks on chest almost black; bill 

 pale brownish (still paler on mandible), becoming dark brownish at 

 tip; legs and feet as in adult male; length (skin), 116.84:; wing, 63.60; 

 tail, 40.39; exposed culmen, 12.45; depth of bill at base, 6.10; tarsus,

Immature males are variously intermediate between the adult male 

 and supposed adult female, as described above. One (No. 131682, 

 same date, etc.) is ipostly uniform black, but the feathers of the rump 

 are broadlj^' margined with olive-brown, and the under parts posterior to 

 the chest a mixture of black and dull yellowish white (mediall}-) and 

 pale brownish (laterally). In this specimen the bill is wholl}' black, 

 thus showing that in this species there is the same curious variation in 

 the color of the bill, without regard apparently to age or season, that 

 exists in the species of Geospiza and Certhidea.

Bill about as long as the middle toe, cuneate in all its profiles, some- 

 what swollen basally, the culmen and lateral outlines decidedly con- 

 cave in the middle portion; mandibular tomia very stronglj^ inflexed,

with a prominent angle near the base, anterior to which the edge is 

 decidedly concave; maxillary tomia with a decided notch near the 

 base, immediately above the mandibular angle; gonys very long (about 

 equal to the exposed portion of the culmen). Nostrils exposed, small, 

 longitudinal, occupying less than the lower half of the nasal foss^. 

 Tarsus a little longer than the middle toe and claw, divided into about 

 six segments, but these entirely fused on the outer side, except the lower 

 one, which is distinct; lateral toes equal, the points of their claws fall- 

 ing short of the base of the middle claw; inner toe entirely separated 

 at the base from the middle toe, and outer with only its first phalanx 

 united; hallux about equal in length to the lateral toes, but much 

 stronger, its claw decidedly larger than that of the middle toe. Wing 

 decidedly longer than the tail, very concave beneath, the seventh, 

 sixth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, the eighth very 

 little shorter, the ninth about equal to the third. Tail about equal to 

 the wing measured to the ends of the secondaries, nearh" even or very 

 slightly rounded, consisting of twelve rectrices, which are acute, but 

 not stiffened at the points; the outer web of the intarmedim broader at 

 the base than the inner web. 



As characters additional to those given in the above diagnosis, it 

 maj' be stated that the bill is slightlj' notched near the tip, that the 

 rictal bristles are so mmute as to be hardlj^ perceptible, and that the 

 posterior face of the tarsus, on both sides, is entirelj^ undivided. 



Range. — Highlands of Costa Rica. (Monotypic.) 



The adult male of Acantliidoiis halrdl resembles \%\y closely in col- 

 oration that of liaplospiza unlcolor, of Brazil, but is darker and less 

 of a bluish cast, both above and below, and has the mandible chieflj' 

 light colored. Not having a specimen of the Mexican H. uniformis, 

 I am unable to point out wif^ exactness the differences from that spe- 

 cies; but judging from the description and remarks given by Messi'S. 

 Salvin and Godman ' it seems to come much closer to that species, if 

 it be not actually the same. It would appear, however, to have decid- 

 edly a shorter wing and longer tail, and longer tarsus than thai, bird. 

 Whether or not it is the same species or congeneric with H. uniformis., 

 there can be no doubt that it is generically distinct from H. unicolor, 

 which has the bill much shorter and more typicalh' Fringillint, the 

 tarsi shorter, and the nostrils moi'e exposed. There can, I thiuK, be 

 no question that Acanthidaps comes very near to Ilajilospiza, and I am 

 inclined to believe that the so-called S. uniformis belongs to Acan- 

 tliidops and not to Haplospiza, since Messrs. Salvin and Godman' say 

 that its chief differences from II. unwolor consist in "a larger bill and 

 longer wings and stronger feet," as well as " rather darker" coloration. 

 If this view of its relationship proves correct, we would then have a 

 Middle American genus, Acanthidops, and a related Brazilian genus,

Small Fringillidae with elongate-oonical compressed bill; wing rather 

 long (ahout three and a half times as long as tarsus), but rounded (ninth 

 prima jy shorter than fourth); tail about three-fourths as long as wing, 

 even or slightly double-rounded; adult males uniform grayish. 



Bill elongate-conical, compressed, with straight outlines; exposed 

 culmen about three-fifths as long as tarsus; deplh of bill at base less 

 than half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla, but nearly equal 

 to length of gonys; maxillarj- tomium faintlj- concave anteriorly and 

 posteriorljr (the latter most decided), faintly convex a little posterior 

 to the middle; mandibular tomium straight to about the middle, then 

 ascending slightl}^ to the apex of the subbasal angle; gonj's about twice 

 as long as mandibular rami. Wing rather long (about three and a half 

 times as long as tarsus), rounded (seventh and sixth primaries longest, 

 ninth shorter than fourth); primaries exceeding secondaries by more 

 than length of exposed culmen. Tail about three-fourths as long as 

 wing, even or slightl}' double-rounded, a little more than half hidden

 longer than commissure, its scutella obvious on inner side, but very 

 indistinct or obsolete on outer side; middle toe with claw about as long 

 as tarsus; lateral claws falling short (?) of base of middle claw; hind 

 claw shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Adult male uniform slate-gray; female, oliA"e-green

 with a larger bill and stronger feet; but whether the bill and feet are 

 larger proportionally is not stated. The female of //. tanforinia is

etc.); tertials very slightly to decidedly produced. Tail two-thirds to 

 five-sevenths as long as wing, two and a half times or more longer 

 than tarsus, half or more hidden by upper coverts, emarginated or 

 double-rounded, the rectrices rather narrow, but not pointed. Tarsus 

 less than twice as long as exposed culmen, its scutella indistinct or 

 obsolete on outer side; middle toe, with claw, as long as or longer than 

 tarsus; lateral toes relatively short, their claws not reaching beyond, 

 sometimes falling short of, base of middle claw; hallux about equal 

 in length to outer toe, its claw variable as to relative length, some- 

 times decidedly longer, sometimes shorter tban the digit. 



Coloration. — Above more or less yellowish, the back usually streaked 

 with dusky; beneath 3'ellow, or largely so. 



Range. — Tropical South America; one species in southern Mexico 

 and Guatemala and one in Jamaica. 



Although regarded by Dr. Sharpe as closely related to Serinus 

 Koch, the resemblance seems to me to be a purely superficial one, not 

 involving structural characters, which are so different that the two 

 genera scarcely need comparison. The supposed structural dif- 

 ferences given on page 169, vol. xii, of the "Catalogue of Birds 

 contained in the British Museum,"^ 1 am unable to appreciate, the 

 tomia being in reality quite as much deflected basallj' in Slcalis as in 

 St-rinus, though there is^ slight difference, that of Serinus commenc- 

 ing a little farther forward. Seisin us, however, has a well-developed 

 fringe of antrorse plumules quite concealing the nostrils, and also a 

 rictal fringe nearly hiding the deflected portion of the commissure, as 

 in Sjyinus, Carj)odacus, and other true "Finches;" has the bill much 

 broader in proportion to its depth, and the tail proportionally longer 

 and more deeply emarginated. In Sicalis the nostrils are fully 

 exposed, the coccothraustine nasal and rictal fringes of Serinus being 

 quite wanting, as in other so-called "Buntings." 



The resemblance in coloration between some of the species of Sicalis 

 and a species of the Old World genus Serinus (S. canarius) is, how- 

 ever, remai'kable; so much so, in fact, that were it not for the differences 

 in structural details it would be very difficult to distinguish them. 



Although at one time I considered the smaller, conspicuously streaked 

 species of Sicalis as generically distinct and proposed to place them 

 in a separate genus (Serinopsis), I now believe that they can not 

 be separated, certain species being quite intermediate in structural 

 characters.

Genus VOLATINIA Reichenbaeh. 



Volatinia Reichenbach, Av. Syst. Nat., 1850, pi. 76, fig. 16. (Type, Tanagra 

 jacarini Linnteus. ) 



Very small Fringillidse with the bill acute-conical, the plumage uni- 

 form glossy blue-black (adult male), or else brown above and buff 

 beneath, with the chest conspicuously streaked (adult female and 

 young). 



Size very small (wing not more than 50.80 millimeters). Bill mod- 

 erate, conical, acute, with nearly straight outlines, decidedly deeper 

 than broad at base; culmen (from concealed base) about two-thirds as 

 long as tarsus, very slightly convex; gonys about equal to basal width 

 of mandible, nearly equal to length of maxilla from nostril, very 

 faintly convex; tomia nearly straight to the rather abrupt basal deflec- 

 tion. Nostrils exposed, small, longitudinally oval. Rictal bristles 

 scarcely obvious. Wing moderate (about three and a third times as 

 long as tarsus), rounded (ninth primary shortest); primaries exceed- 

 ing secondaries by less than length of bill from nostril. Tail about 

 six-sevenths as long as wing, less than three times as long as tarsus, 

 much rounded, the rectrices broad, with rounded tips. Tarsal scutella 

 rather distinct; middle toe with claw about as long as tarsus; lateral 

 claws falling decidedly short of base of middle claw; hallux rather 

 shorter than lateral toes, its claw shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Adult males glossy blue-black, with or without white 

 under wing-coverts; females and young brownish, paler (more or less 

 buffy) beneath, the chest conspicuously streaked with dusk3^ 



Range. — Continental Tropical America (southern Mexico to south- 

 ern Brazil, etc.); also islands of Trinidad and Tobago, and island of 

 Grenada, Lesser Antilles. (Monotypic.)

 purplish on head and neck, duller on posterior under parts; remiges 

 and rectrices dead black, the tertials (the rectrices also, in fresh plum- 

 age) edged with steel bluish; under wing-coverts and axillars also 

 glossy blue-black; a concealed white patch immediately above and 

 anterior to junction of wing with body; bill, legs, and feet black (the 

 former with mandible sometimes grayish or horn colored); iris brown; 

 length (skins), 87.63-109.47 (100.08); wing, 45.72-50.80 (48.51); tail, 

 37.59-44.70 (40.89); exposed culmen, 9.14-10.67 (9.91); depth of bill 

 at base, .6.60-7.37 (6.86); tarsus, 14.22-16.00 (15.75); middle toe, 

 10.16-11.43 (10.67).' 



Iimnature male. — Above dull brown (intermediate between raw 

 umber and bister), the scapulars and upper tail-coverts glossy blue- 

 black beneath the surface; wings and tail black, the larger wing-coverts 

 and tertials margined with tawny brown; under parts pale brownish, 

 buffy, or brownish white, the basal (partly exposed) portion of the 

 feathers black; maxilla dark brownish, mandible much paler. (Many 

 specimens are variouslj' intermediate between this plumage and the

^I am unable to tabulate any differences between females and young of the two 

 forms. Only one adult female of V. j. jacarini has been examined, and no young 

 birds. So far as I can see the female is not obviously different from that of F. }■

Admit female. — Above olive or olive-brownish, the feathers very 

 indistinctly darker centrall}'; wings and tail dusky, with lighter olive 

 or olive-brown edgings; under parts brownish buflfy, paler on abdo- 

 men (sometimes on throat also), the chest with rather broad cuneate 

 streaks of dusky grayish brown, the sides and flanks with narrower, 

 more linear, streaks of the same; maxilla dusky brown, mandible 

 much paler; legs and feet horn brownish; length (skins), 90.17-106.17 

 (98.81); Wing, 43.69-50.80 (47.24); tail, 35.05-44.45 (40.13); exposed

 sus, 14.22-15.75 (14.99); middle toe, 9.65-11.18 (10.41).^ 



Young. — Very similar to adult female, but middle and greater wing- 

 coverts and tertials margined terminally by brownish buffy or dull 

 tawny. 



.Southern Mexico, in States of Vera Cruz (Jalapa, Jico, San Andres 

 Tuxtla), Puebla (Huehuetlan, Atlixco), Mexico (valley of Mexico), 

 Morelos (Yautepec), Sinaloa (Mazatlan, Presidio), Jalisco (Ixtapa), 

 Colima, Oaxaca, and Chiapas (Chicharras, Ocuilapa), and Territor}' of 

 Tepic (Santiago), southward through Central America to western and 

 central Ecuador, Guiana, Trinidad, and Tobago; island of Grenada, 

 Lesser Antilles. 



'Seven specimens. 



Average measurements of specimens from different localities are as follows: 



Two adult females and an immature male from Yautepec, Morelos, and an imma- 

 ture male from Colima, Jalisco, are altogether paler in color of the upper parts than 

 specimens from other parts of Mexico, which, in coloration, are precisely like those 

 from Central America and northern South America. The upper parts are light 

 brown (intermediate between broccoli brown and Isabella color),- but the under 

 parts are not differently colored from those of more eastern and southern localities.. 

 Whether these specimens indicate a different form for western Mexico can only be 

 determined by examination of adequate material.

I am not quite satisfied as to the propriety of referring to this form specimens from 

 Cuba and the Caymans, which seem to differ in average duller coloration and decidedly 

 longer wing and tail in males, there being apparently much more sexual difference in 

 size than among specimens from Haiti and Jamaica. Much larger series of specimens 

 will be necessary to settle this question, however.

*Some specimens have the crown and auricular region olive-green, as in E. o. inter- 

 media and the Antillean forms, and are scarcely to be distinguished from the former. 

 Since, however, specimens with black crowns and auriculars occur, usually pre- 

 dominantly, in the same localities, it is reasonable to suppose that these specimens 

 with olive-green crown, etc., are younger individuals.

The series of sixty -two adult males and twenty-eight adult females, 

 repi'esenting the above-mentioned localities, while a large one in the 

 aggregate, is nevertheless far from satisfactory as a means of deter- 

 mining whether specimens from different islands really differ from one 



'Twenty-eight specimens. 



Specimens from the different islands average as follows:

another. Collectively they represent a form which may readily he 

 distinguished frona E. h. hicolor of the Bahamas by decidedly shorter 

 wing and tail and brighter olive or olive-greenish upper parts, and 

 from E. }}. marchii of Jamaica, Barbados, and Grenada bv having, in the 

 adult male, the black of the chest extending over the breast (sometimes 

 over the belly also) and without abrupt posterior outline. 



When a sufficient number of specimens from each island shall have 

 been brought together and carefully compared, it is almost certain 

 that several local forms will have to be recognized. The existence of 

 these is clearly indicated )iy the meager series before me, specimens 

 from different islands, notably those from Santa Lucia and St. Thomas, 

 being uniformlj' peculiar in certain features of coloration. Thus the 

 three adult males from Santa Lucia are browner than those from 

 other islands, the black on anterior under parts very restricted (but 

 of quite different form from that of E. h. marchii^ the remaining under 

 parts being peculiarlj^ dark and brownish. The four adult males from 

 St. Thomas have the "solid" portion of the black chest as restricted 

 as in E. h. marchii, but it merges into the lighter-colored posterior area 

 bj^ intervening blackish feathers with pale margins, thus producing a 

 somewhat streaked appearance. Were it certain that the specimens 

 examined are really fully adult bii'ds, I would not hesitate to separate 

 the birds from Santa Lucia and St. Thomas, respectively, as local 

 forms; but there is a possibilitj" thej^ may not yet have acquired the ' 

 perfect plumage of the adult male. 



"\Mth four adult males from Venezuela, I am unable to distinguish 

 any peculiarities, as compared with Antillean specimens, except that 

 the tail averages decidedlj' shorter. In coloration they appear to be 

 quite identical with specimens from Porto Rico and some other Carib- 

 bean islands. 



An adult, or nearly adult, male from Bogota, Colombia, in the col- 

 lection of the American Museum of Natural History (No. 41327) is 

 scarce!}' to be distinguished from E. h. marchii in color, the black of the 

 anterior under parts extending no farther back than the chest and 

 ending quite abruptly. Dr. Sharpe, however, describes an adult male 

 from Colombia as having "the black extending down the center of 

 the abdomen, but not reaching to the vent," and therefore I am dis- 

 posed to regard the specimen mentioned above as not in full plumage. 

 A good series of specimens, however, will be necessary to establish 

 the relationship of the Colombian bird. The American Museum speci- 

 men measures as follows: Wing, 55.88; tail, 38.86; exposed culmen, 

 9.40; depth of bill at base, 7.37; tarsus, 18.03; middle toe, 13.46.

Loxigilla (not Lesson)^ of Authors. 



Small or medium-sized Fringillidae with a short, more or less stout, 

 bill, rather short and rounded wings and tail, and uniform (never 

 streaked or spotted) plumage, the males black with rufous on throat, 

 sometimes also on pileum and under tail-coverts. 



Bill short, more or less stout, much deeper than broad at base; cul- 

 men strongly convex throughout, the exposed portion equal to more 

 than half to more than two-thirds the length of the tarsus; gonj^s 

 straight or very slightlj- convex, much less than length of maxilla from 

 nostril, slightly exceeding (P. noctis) or much less than {P. violacea) 

 width of mandible at base; maxilla about equal in depth to mandible, 

 or at least not distinctly less, its tomia without subterminal notch, 

 slightly concave to the not abrupt basal deflection; mandibular tomium 

 strongly convex, with a shallow notch in front of the distinctly toothed 

 subbasal angle [violacea) or nearly straight to the neither notched 

 nor toothed angle ( noctis) ; culmen sharply ridged {noctis) or scarcely 

 ridged {violacea). Nostrils minute and circular {violacea), or larger, 

 longitudinally ovate {noctis), nearly' concealed bj^ dense frontal feath- 

 ers. Rictal bristles not obvious. Wing nearly four times as long as 

 tarsus, rounded; eighth to fifth primaries longest, the ninth shorter 

 than the fourth {noctis), or seventh to fifth longest, with ninth shorter 

 than third {violacea); primaries exceeding secondaries by less than 

 length of exposed culmen {violacea) or more {noctis). Tail about three- 

 fourths {noctis) to seven-eighths {violacea) as long as wing, slightlj^ 

 rounded, the rectrices broad. Tarsus less {?ioctis) to more {violacea) 

 than one-third as long as tail, its scutella distinct; middle toe with

 to base of middle claw; hallux about as long as inner toe, its 

 shorter than the digit. 



Coloration.— Adult males uniform black with rufous patchei 

 latter on throat, crown, or under tail-coverts; adult females simile 

 usually duller, the black sometimes replaced by grayish; youn 

 streaked. 



Range. — West Indies; Guiana?. 



Notwithstanding its close resemblance to the type of this ger 

 coloration, the structural differences in P. iioctls are so numerou 

 striking as almost to warrant its generic separation.

The relationships of this form both to P. n.propinqua (Lawrence), of 

 Guiana (see page 000), and P. n. crivscdis, of St. Vincent, are very close. 

 It agrees very exactly with the former in average measurements, but 

 apparently adult males^ of P. u. grenadeims are more intensely black 

 and have the chestnut-rufous throat-patch extending farther backward, 

 the lower throat being black in P. n. projyinqua. From P. n. crissalis 

 it differs in the opposite way so far as the extent of the throat-patch is 

 concerned. How far these supposed differences maj' depend on the 

 "make" of the skins examined it is difficult to determine.

According to Mr. Cory the adult male of this form never assumes 

 the black and chestnut-rufous plumage of other forms, but remains in 

 a plumage indistinguishable from that of the adult female. The latter 

 resembles the same sex of the lighter colored allied forms, especially 

 P. noctis sclateri and P. n. ridgwayi, between which it is exactly inter- 

 mediate in coloration, but both sexes lack the distinct buffy or light 

 rusty suffusion to the lores, etc., to be seen in all the other forms.

Very small granivorous Fringillidae with stout, short bill with culmen 

 strongly curved, wings short and rounded, tail shorter than wing, 

 rounded, double-rounded, or somewhat graduated, and plumage plain 

 or pied (alwaj-s plain and unstreaked in females and j'oung). 



Size very small (wing not more than 57.15 mm.). Bill short, 

 broad, and deep, with distinctly convex culmen, the exposed portion 

 of the latter about two-thirds as long as tarsus; maxilla nearly or quite 

 as deep as mandible, its tomium slightly concave throughout or nearly 

 straight for most of its length, concave at extremities, never (?) 

 abruptly deflected basally ; mandibular tomium convex, nearly straight 

 in middle portion, indistinctly angulated basallj'; gonys straight or 

 verj' slightly convex, shorter than width of mandible at base, the lat- 

 ter less than depth of bill at base, which exceeds length of maxilla 

 from nostril. Wing about three and a quarter times as long as tarsus, 

 the primaries short, eighth to sixth longest (or ninth to seventh in 

 &'. iiu'nufa), the ninth shorter than the fourth. Tail shorter than wing, 

 double-rounded {S. minuta), graduated (S. torqueola), or slightly 

 rounded (other species), the rectrices broad, less than half hidden by 

 the upper coverts. Tarsus about one and a half times as long as 

 exposed culmen, its scutella obvious, but not distinct; middle toe 

 with claw equal to or longer than tarsus; lateral claws reaching to base 

 of middle claw; hind claw variable, usually shorter, sometimes (S. 

 ii< in ata) longer than its digit. 



Coloratian. — Variable, but never streaked (except sometimes the 

 back); sexes different. 



Ramje. — The whole of continental tropical America (southern Texas 

 to Paraguay, etc.). 



There is great difference between the small-billed S. minutamth 

 its slightly curved culmen, long, slender toes and claws, and long outer- 

 most primary, and /S. hypoleuca, representing the opposite extreme 

 from these characters; but other species are so variously intermediate 

 that I prefer, at present, not to make anj- subdivision of the genus.

I cannot refer this bird to S. g. grisea, since, upon comparing it with twelve adult 

 males of the latter, including five from Bogota, it seems very distinct; apart from its 

 very much darker coloration, conspicuous white spot on each side of the lower throat, 

 and abrupt definition of the white abdominal area against the deep slate-color of 

 sides and chest, the wing is much longer, the tail decidedly shorter, the tarsus much 

 shorter, and the bill not only smaller but quite different in shape, the culmen being 

 much less strongly convex and the maxilla conspicuously shallower. 



Adult males of the two forms examined average in measurements as follows:

'Examination of additional material has convinced me that I led Messrs. Salvin 

 and Godman into error by informing them (see Ibis, 1891, p. Ill) that the type of 

 S. parva was certainly a different form from the females of that which they subse- 

 quently named S. richardsoni. I have not been able to examine the latter in the 

 present connection, and there is thus still a possibility that they may really not be 

 females of the present bird, in which case my opinion, as expressed to them, would 

 be correct; but I have carefully compared the type of /S'. parva with specimens which 

 are unquestionably females of S. richardsoni from Mexico, and find it to be without 

 doubt the same form.

BIBD8 OF WOKTH AND MIDDLE AMEEICA. 573 



SPOROPHILA AURITA (Bonaparte). 

 HICKS'S SEEDEATER. 



Adult male, white-throated phase {^=^8penaophila hioksii Law- 

 rence). — Exactly like the fully adult male of S. morelleti, except that 

 there are no white spots at tips of middle or greater wing-coverts. 

 Pileum, sides of head, hindneck, back, scapulars, wings, upper tail- 

 coverts, tail, and broad band across chest, black; chin, throat, sides of 

 neck, under parts of bodj^ posterior to the black jugular band, axillars, 

 under wing-coverts, and large spot at base of sixth to first primaries, 

 white; whole rump white, but with concealed portion of feathers 

 black, this exposed in places; sides and flanks with basal portion of 

 feathers black or dusky, producing a clouded or mottled effect; bill 

 dusky; legs and feet dark brownish. 



Adult male , hlack-throated phase {^= Spermophihi semicoUaThs Law- 

 rence^). — Deep black, including whole chin and throat, with more or 

 less of a white space on side of neck, and the abdomen mostly white; 

 rump black, or with very slight admixture of white; white spot at 

 base of primaries reduced in size. 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult female of S. eorrinn, but under 

 parts somewhat paler, especially the abdomen, which is always more 

 or less dull whitish or very pale j'ellowish, sometimes extensively so. 



Adult ma^e.— Length (skins), 95.50-106.17 (100.33); wing, 50.80- 

 65.12 (52.58); tail, 41.66-15.97 (44.45); exposed culmen, S.81)-».91 

 (9.40); depth of bill at base (four specimens), 7.37-8.13 (7.62); tarsus, 

 13.97-16.51 (15.24); middle toe, 10.16-12.45 (11.18)." 



Adult female.— Length (skins), 99.06-101.85 (100.08); wing, 50.29- 

 53.34 (51.56); tail, 39.88^1.91 (40.89); exposed culmen, 9.40-9.65 



' The type of S. semicoUaris does not represent the extreme black phase, which (as 

 represented by a specimen in the U. S. National Museum collection from Colon) has 

 a mere trace of white on sides of neck, not a trace of white on rump, and the wing- 

 spot very small. Intermediate conditions of plumage are represented by the types of 

 S. collaris Lawrence and S. fortipes Lawrence. The former has nearly as much white 

 on the under parts of the body and on the rump as the white-throated phase descriVjed 

 above, but the chin and throat are black, separated from the black jugular band by a 

 very narrow band of white. The latter is very slightly different from the type of S. 

 semicoUaris, but has a very little white on the chin. 



The characters of this supposed species being exactly intermediate between .S'. 

 morelleti and S. corvina, and the individual variations of plumage running very nearly 

 into these two species, I feel convinced that either 8. aurita consists simply of a series 

 of hybrids between the two species named or else that it is a species which hybrid- 

 izes with them both. The lightest-colored examples of 8. aurita, like the type of 

 8. hickmi, can only be distinguished from fully adult males of 8. morelleti by the 

 absence of small white spots at the tips of the middle and greater wing-coverts. The 

 darkest examples, on the other hand, are precisely like 8. corvina, except that there 

 is a considerable amount of white on the abdomen; but of this white there is often a 

 decided indication in S. corvina.

I find myself unable to subdivide this species satisfactorily. It is true specimens 

 representing the fully adult male plumage described above are wanting in the series 

 from the State of Tamaulipas and the adjacent parts of Texas; but males from that 

 district agree exactly in plumage with immature males from more southern localities, 

 and I believe that fully adult males have simply not yet been taken in the region 

 designated. 




576 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Young.— Similar to the adult female, but wing bars deep buffy and 

 plumage of a much looser texture. (Immature males are variously 

 intermediate in coloration between the fully adult male, as described 

 above, and the adult female, two or three years being probably 

 required for attainment of the full plumage. Some freshly molted 

 adult males, especially those showing traces of immaturity, have the 

 under parts posterior to the black jugular band more or less buffy, 

 sometimes (juite strongly so. These occur in the same localities as 

 specimens with the same parts pure white. )

' It is remarkable that while in Mexico and thence to Honduras this species appears 

 to be confined to the Atlantic slope (except in Guatemala and perhaps in Chiapas 

 and Oaxaca) , it appears to skip Nicaragua altogether to reappear in western Costa 

 Rica, where, according to Cherrie (Auk, ix, 1892, 27), it occurs from the valley of 

 San Jos^ to the Pacific coast. If the species occurs anywhere in Nicaragua I have 

 been unable to iind any record to that effect.

 (seventh primary longest, ninth much longer than secondaries). Tail 

 decidedly shoi'ter than wing, slightly rounded. Tarsus rather short 

 (about equal to middle toe with claw, or a little more). 



Coloration. — Adult males plain slate-graj^ or slate-bluish, usually 

 darker on head, in some species with under wing-coverts and axillars 

 white; adult females tawny brown above, paler (sometimes inclining

Genus CYANOSPIZA Baird. 



Cyanospiza Baird, Rep. Pacific R. R. Surv., ix, June 19, 1858, 500. (Type, Tan- 

 agra cyanea Linnaeus.)^ 



Small semi-arboreal Fringillidfe with rather long, rather pointed 

 wings, tail shorter than wing and even or slightly double-rounded, and 

 small bill with mandible conspicuously deeper than maxilla, the latter 

 more or less falcate; adult males brilliantly colored, with blue, green, 

 purple, or sometimes red predominating, the adult females and young 

 plain brown or green above, paler and sometimes obsoletely streaked 

 beneath. 



Bill small, much deeper than broad at the base, with the mandible 

 conspicuously deeper than the maxilla, the latter more or less falcate; 

 culmen shorter than middle toe without claw, more or less convex, 

 distinctly ridged; gonys straight, shorter than distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla; maxillary tomium abruptly angulated subbasally {ci/a- 

 nea), gradually concave throughout (versicolor), or variously interme 

 diate between these extremes; mandibular tomium straight to the 

 abrupt subbasal angle {cyanea), convex or arched throughout without 

 a subbasal angle {versicolor), or variously intermediate; no obvious 

 notch near tip of maxillary tomium. Nostril exposed, very small, 

 roundish, in anterior portion of nasal fossae. Rictal bristles very 

 minute (obvious only in versicolor). Wing moderate to long (three 

 and three-fourths to nearly four and a half times as long as tarsus), 

 pointed, with ninth primary nearly or quite the longest {arrmna); 

 rounded, with ninth primary shorter than fourth {versicolor), or vari- 

 ously intermediate (other species). Tail three-fourths to four-fifths as 

 long as wing, even or slightly double-rounded {cyamsa, ciris), slightly 

 rounded {versicolor), or emarginated {ammna). Tarsus about one- 

 third as long as tail (more or less), equal to or slightly longer than 

 middle toe with claw, its scutella distinct; lateral claws not reaching to 

 base of middle claw; hallux shorter than lateral toes, its claw decidedly 

 shorter than the digit. 



Colors. — Adult males with more or less of blue, sometimes varied 

 with purple, red, orange, yellow, or green; adult femajles plain brown- 

 ish or olive-green above, paler (sometimes indistinctly streaked) beneath; 

 young similar to adult females, but more distinctly streaked beneath. 



Although the genus Cyanospiza, as usually limited, constitutes a 

 very well circumscribed group so far as coloration is concerned, it is 

 found to be a rather heterogeneous one when structural characters are 

 considered. No two of the species agree very closely in details of 

 external form, G. versicolor being, perhaps, the most aberrant, in its 

 much-rounded wing, distinctly rounded tail, narrow, falcate maxilla, 

 broad mandible, and strongly arched commissure. C. cirls most nearly 



'See Ridgway, Auk, xv, Oct., 1898, 323. 




BIBDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 581 



approaches C. versicolor in the form of the bill, but has a pointed 

 wing and almost emarginate tail (the lateral rectricew being longer 

 than the middle pair), while its tarsus is much longer, relativelj', than 

 that of any other species. C. cyanea has, like O. versicolor, the maxilla 

 conspicuously narrower than the mandible, but the culmen is nearly 

 straight, and the commissui-c quite so as far as the abrupt basal angu- 

 lation. In wing and tail, C. cyanea agrees with G. c'vru. G. amoena, 

 which represents the opposite extremes of form from G. versicolm^ hav- 

 ing the culmen and commissure straight, like G. cyanea, but the latter is 

 much less deflected basall}', the maxilla not oonspicuouslj- narrower 

 than the mandible, and the bill is much less compressed; but it differs 

 from all its congeners in its distinctly emarginate tail, long outermost 

 primary (but little shorter than the eighth). It is also the only species 

 which has white wing-bands and white under parts. C. rositcp, again, 

 is peculiar in its long and narrow bill.

•Eighteen specimens. 



''Eleven specimens. 



Specimens from the Mississippi Valley average slightly smaller than those from the 

 Atlantic coast district, although the difference is confined to length of wing, tail, and 

 tarsus. I can not detect any constant difference in coloration. The two series meas- 

 ured average as follows: 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 583 



Yomig. — Similar to adult female, but averaging rather browner, 

 especially on under parts, the back sometimes (especially in first 

 plumage) obsoletely streaked. (Immature males in second, and prob- 

 ably third, years are variously intermediate in coloration between 

 fully adult males and females.)

 15, 1875).=* 



' Thirty-one specimens. 

 ^ Eight specimens. 



Average measurements of specimens from eastern Mexico, western Mexico, and 

 Lower California, respectively, are as follows: 



The supposed differences of coloration between specimens from eastern Mexico, on 

 the one hand, and those from western ilexico and Lower California on the other, 

 prove, on the evidence of a much larger series, not to hold good. There ia, however, 

 a decided difference in the shape of the bill between Lower Calif ornia specimens and 

 those from eastern Mexico, the former having the bill relatively shorter, with the 

 maxilla much more strongly curved, almost falcate, and the color of the bill la 

 likewise paler, the maxilla being brown (rarely dark brown) instead of blackish. 

 The length of wing and tail also average decidedly less, as may be seen from the 

 above average measurements. Were it not for the intermediate character of speci- 

 mens from western Mexico it would be comparatively easy to characterize a sub- 

 species, C. I'erskolor pulchra, for the Lower California bird. The birds from western 

 Mexico, wljile intermediate in size, seem to agree best with those from Lower Cali- 

 fornia in form and color of the bill, and a larger series of specimens may possibly yet 

 show that two forms can be recognized.

Genus CYANOCOMPSA Cabanis. 



Oyanocompsa^ Cabanis, Journ. fiir Orn., ix, Jan., 1861, 4. (Type, Cyanohxia 

 parellina Bonaparte. ) 



Unicolored, or nearly unicolored, round-winged Fringillidffi with 

 stout, conical bill; adult males bluish black or dark blue, becoming 

 more bluish or bright blue on forehead, cheeks, and lesser wing-coverts 

 (sometimes on rump also); females and young uniform brownish. 



Bill very variable in relative size, but stout and conical, deeper than 

 broad at base, with the mandibular tomium strongly angulated or 

 (in G. cyatiea and O. parellina and allies) strongly arched. Nostrils 

 exposed, rather small, nearly circular, opening against anterior edge 

 of the very broad and rounded nasal fossse. Eictal bristles inconspic- 

 uous. Wing rather short (less than four times as long as tarsus), much 

 rounded (seventh to fifth primaries longest, the ninth shortest); prima- 

 ries exceeding secondaries by less than two-thirds the length of the 

 tiusus. Tail nearly as long as wing, much rounded (difference between 

 longest and shortest rectrices equal to length of gonys), about half 

 hidden by the upper coverts, the rectrices broad, but with rather 

 pointed tips. Tarsus a little longer than middle toe with claw; outer 

 claw reaching about to base of middle claw, the inner not quite so far; 

 hind claw much shorter than its digit. 



Col<>i'><.^~k.dMXi males uniform dark dull blue, brighter blue on 

 forehead, cheeks, and lesser wing-coverts; adult females and young 

 uniform brown. 



RaiKje. — Mexico to southeastern Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, and 

 western Ecuador. 



With a close superficial resemblance to Guiraca, this genus is very 

 distinct in its much shorter and very much rounded wing (ninth pri- 

 marj' shorter than first instead of longer than fifth), more rounded 

 tail with much broader rectrices, and conspicuously more turgid bill. 



For a time 1 was disposed to separate C. cyanea and C. jparellhia from 

 C. concreta and C. cyanoidet< as a distinct but unnamed genus or sub- 

 genus,^ on account of marked differences in the form of the bill, but the 

 first-named species is so clearly intermediate in this respect between 

 O. concreta and 0. parellina that it seems best to consider them all as 

 belonging to one group. The bill in C. concreta and its southern sub- 

 species is very stout, conical, much deeper than broad at base, with 

 nearly straight outlines; the culmen (from base) about as long as tarsus, 

 very slightly convex for terminal half (more or less), straight basally 

 (extreme base arched), scarcely or not at all ridged; the gonys straight, 

 shorter than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; the maxilla nearly 

 as deep as the mandible, its tomium decidedly convex in middle, 



' " Kvavoc,, blau und K0)iii>6i, geschmiickt." 



^The type of Cyaiioloxia, )jy elimination, is Pyrrhnhi ghxiwo-cxmlea D'Orbigny. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 595 



slightly notched near tip, and ver}^ abruptly deflected basally, from im- 

 mediately beneath the nostril; the mandibular tomium slightly sinuated 

 in front of the prominent rounded subbasal angle, slightly convex 

 toward the acute ''ip of the mandible, the basal deflection very great. 



In C. cyanea the bill is relatively nearly as large as in G. concreta, 

 but the culmen is decidedly convex and distinctly ridged; the maxillary 

 tomium is much less "lobed" or convex in the middle portion and less 

 abruptly deflected basally ; the mandibular tomium is strongly convex, 

 with the subbasal angle much less evident and relativelj^ farther for- 

 ward, the tomium having thus a stronglj- arched general outline, 

 while the width of the mandible is decidedly greater than that of the 

 maxilla. 



C. parellina and its allies, O. p. indigotica and O. p. sundchrasti, 

 while agreeing with O. cyanea in the form of the bill, has this member 

 relatively much smaller, the culmen being not more than five-eighths 

 as long as the tarsus, and the tail, instead of being decidedly rounded, 

 is very little so or sometimes almost even. 



It is vei'y difficult, with the material before me, to decide what are 

 distinct species and what merely geographic races among the forms 

 usually recognized. Nothing can be more obvious, however, than 

 that C. concreta and the more southern form usually called Guiraoa 

 cyanoides (not the Coccoborus cyanoides of Lafresnaye, however) com- 

 pleteh" intergrade, and are therefore merel}' subspecies. The true O. 

 cyanoides seems to be a distinct species, and although generallj^ con- 

 founded with C. cyaiiea is far less related to that species than to the 

 southern form of C. concreta before mentioned. There are evidently 

 two or more subspecies of O. cyanea, one of which has been separated 

 by Dr. Sharpe.

Specimens from different localities average as follows: 



' It is exceedingly difficult to define the northern range of this form or the south- 

 ern range of C. c. concreta, owing to the fact that the two intergrade so gradually. 

 All specimens seen from Veragua, Oosta Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras are really 

 neither C. c. concreta nor C. c. cyanescens; most of them, however, are rather nearer to 

 the latter, especially those from more southern localities. It may be observed that 

 according to the limits which I have assigned to the southern range of C. c. concreta 

 and the northern range of C. c. cyanescens there is an overlapping in Honduras and 

 Nicaragua. This is more or less the case, for while certain Honduras specimens are 

 more like the Panama birds in coloration, some of those from Nicaragua and north- 

 ern Costa Bica (Rio Frio) are nearer the Mexican and Guatemalan birds in color. 



* Ecuadorean specimens are possibly distinct. I have not been able to examine 

 any in this connection.

 similar in coloration to adult male of G. cyanea, but rump concolor

' There is an adult female Cyanocompsa from Panama in the collection of the Ameri- 

 can Museum of Natural History (No. 41185, J. McLeannan, collector) which agrees 

 very closely with the Cayenne and Santai-em females in coloration except that the 

 upper surface is slightly more rufescent, or about intermediate in color between that 

 of the same parts in the female of C. cyanoides and Panama examples of C. conereta 

 cyanescens. The measurements agree sufficiently with those of unquestionable 

 females of C. ct/anoides except those of the bill, which agree best with C. conereta 

 cyanescens. To which form the specimen in question should be referred I am unable 

 to determine without a much larger series. 



*Lafresnaye evidently had two very distinct birds in hand when he described his 

 Coccoborus cyanoides. The supposed female or young bird, described in Latin, and 

 said to have come from Panama, would seem from the description to be clearly the 

 Panama form which has generally been known by the specific name cyanoides; but 

 the adult male described below is not that species, but another which resembles much 

 more in coloration the common C. cyanea, of wide range in eastern South America, 

 and differing chiefly in the more elongated and conical bill, as Lafresnaye explicitly 

 states, a free translation of his description being as follows: "The coloration of the 

 adult male is . entirely like that of the Coc. cyaneus, blue grosbeak [i. e. , G cyanea] ; 

 that is to say, it is everywhere of a deep dark blue, enlivened by a beautiful celes- 

 tial blue upon the feathers of the forehead, of the eyebrows, of the corners of the 

 lower jaw, and upon the smaller wing-coverts. It differs from it, then, only by a 

 long conical beak, much more elongate, less swollen laterally at its base, but more 

 elevated near the forehead and much less arched above. ' ' 



Having been able, through the courtesy of the officers of the Boston Society of 

 Natural History, to examine Lafresnaye' s types, I find that the male specimen exactly 

 corresponds with Lafresnaye's description, as given above; but the supposed female 

 or young bird is neither of the same species nor the Panama form of C. conereta 

 formerly called cyanoides, but is a young example of Guiraca cserulea! Possibly it 

 may not be the specimen from which Lafresnaye took his description of the sup- 

 posed female or young, but there is a possibility that it may be; therefore, no other 

 course seems proper than to transfer the name cyanoides from the Panama form of 

 C conereta to the Amazonian species to which Lafresnaye's adult male of his Cocco- 

 borus cyanoides unquestionably belongs.

 less margined with white, especially at tips; maxilla black, mandible 

 grayish (pale grayish blue in life); iris brown; legs and feet dark horn 

 color. 



Adult male in winter. — Essentially like the summer male, but the 

 blue more or less obscured bj'' light brownish and buflfy margins to 

 the feathers, especially on back and breast, the feathers of flanks and 

 abdomen margined terminally with light buff or whitish, and lateral 

 rectrices margined terminally with white. 



Adult fen talc in summer. — Above olive-brownish, more or less tinged 

 with tawnj', passing into a decidedlj' more grayish hue (usually more 

 or less tinged with blue) on rump and upper tail-coverts; scapulars 

 and interscapulars more or less darker centrally or medially, forming 

 indistinct streaks; wings and tail dusky, the latter with dull grayish 

 blue, the former with light brownish edgings; middle wing-coverts 

 rather broadly tipped with light cinnamon-rufous or tawny and termi- 

 nal margins of greater coverts usually tinged with the same; under 

 parts brownish bufly or clay color, deepest on chest, paler on throat 

 and abdomen; bill brownish, the mandible paler. (Plumage of head 

 and body sometimes marked with light blue in more or less extensive 

 patches.) 



Adult femcde in winter. — Similar to the summer female, but color- 

 ation deeper, more tawny. 



Young {sexes alike). — Similar to the adult female in winter, but still 

 more tawny, the rump and upper tail-coverts tawny-olive.

GUIRACA CiERULEA LAZULA (Lesson). 

 WESTERN BLTTE OROSBEAE, 



Similar to O. c. ccerulea but wing and tail decidedly longer and color- 

 ation lighter, with wing-bands broader; adult male with the blue color 

 lighter and less purplish, the wing-bands much broader and paler, that 

 across tips of greater coverts usually (when not abraded) 5.08-7.62 

 wide and decidedly paler than the middle covert band; white margins 

 to under tail-coverts broader, rarely, if ever, indistinct; adult female 

 and .young with the general coloration paler and decidedly less tawny. 



A(kilt mafe.— Length (skins), 149.86-177.80 (162.31); wing, 86.36- 

 96.52 (90.42); tail, 66.55-78.74 (70.36); exposed culmen, 13.97-17.78

 (20.83); middle toe, 15.49-17.78 (16.51).^* 



' Sixty-five specimens. 



''Twenty-nine specimens. 



Tiiere ia a decided average difference in measurements of specimens from separate 

 geographic areas, this being so marked that further subdivision may ultimately be 

 deemed necessary. Averages of the series examined are as follows: 



There is also much individual variation among specimens from the same geographic 

 area, one adult female from Oaxaca (Huitzo) having the tarsus only 20.83 mm., 

 while two others from the same State have the tarsus 22.86 and 23.11, respectively. 

 Some specimens from Utah and other parts of the Great Basin agree in small meas- 

 urements, especially of the bill, with California examples and not, as might be 

 expected, with those from Arizona. The average difference in measurements is not 

 great except in case of the California birds, which have a decidedly smaller bill even 

 than true O. cxrvlea, though the wing and tail are decidedly longer. The coloration 

 being quite identical, so far as I am able to see, in specimens from the different areas 

 designated above, I am not disposed to make any subdivision of the Western form. 

 It mav. however, eventuallv nrove desirable to do so.

vidana Linnaeus.) 



Stoutly built, large arboreal Fringillidse with under wing-coverts 

 yellow or rose pink, and the wings marked with white; nostrils 

 exposed; adult males with breast rose red or tawny, the head black 

 (or mostljr so), and exterior rectrices extensively white terminally. 



Bill short, conical, much deeper than broad at base, with superior and 

 lateral outlines very slightly convex, the gonys straight oi' very faintly 

 convex; culmen, from extreme base, decidedly shorter than tarsus; 

 gonys a little shorter than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; 

 mandibular tomium very faintly convex to the toothed subbasal angle, 

 the maxillary tomium nearly straight to its basal deflection, distinctly 

 notched near tip. Nostril exposed, rather large, nearly circular, with 

 membrane above and behind it. Eictal bristles very inconspicuous. 

 Wing rather long (about four and a half to four and two-thirds times 

 as long as tarsus), pointed (ninth to Sixth primaries longest, the ninth 

 longer than fifth, sometimes longer than sixth) ; primaries exceeding 

 secondaries by more than the length of the tarsus. Tail more than 

 three-fourths as long as wing, even or slightly rounded, the rectrices 

 broad and rounded at ends, more than half hidden by the upper coverts. 

 Tarsus about as long as middle toe with claw; outer claw reaching to 

 or slightly beyond base of middle claw, the inner a little shorter; hind 

 claw stout and strongly curved, shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Adult males with head, wings, and tail black; two broad 

 bands across wing, patch at base of primaries, and terminal portion of 

 inner webs of outermost rectrices, white; under wing-coverts rose pink 

 or gamboge yellow. Adult females with wings and tail similar, but 

 black duller and white markings more restricted; other black portions 

 of male replaced by brownish, streaked with dusky; under wing- 

 coverts saffron yellow or lemon yellow; breast streaked. 



Rcmge. — Temperate North America (south to northern South Amer- 

 ica in winter). (Two species.)

 tail-coverts black, with large terminal spots of white; tail black, with 

 inner webs of three outermost rectrices extensively white terminally; 

 chest, median portion of breast, under wing-coverts, and axillars rose 

 red or light carmine (varying to geranium or peach-blossom pink, 

 more rarely to light poppj' red)'; rest of under parts of body white, 

 the rump also white; maxilla light bi'ownish, becoming dusky ter- 

 minally; mandible paler (more lilaceous in life); iris brown; legs and 

 feet grayish horn color. 



Adult male in wintei\ — Wings, tail, and upper tail-coverts as in 

 summer; head, neck, back, and scapulars brown, more or less streaked 

 with black, the blackish streaks broadest on scapulars, which are 

 merely margined with brown; color of head relieved by a median 

 crown- stripe, a superciliary stripe, and malar stripe of pale buffyor 

 butfy whitish; under parts brownish white or pale brownish (paler or 

 more purely white posteriorly), the chest, sides, and flanks more 

 or less streaked with dusky, the first more or less extensively tinged 

 or suffused with rose red or rose pink. 



Young male in first winter. — Similar to the adult male in winter, 

 but wings, upper tail-coverts, and tail grayish brown, instead of black, 

 the last without anj- white, the first with the white markings much 

 reduced and more or less tinged with brown; back and scapulars more 

 uniformly brown; rump brown, or bufl'y olive; chest, sides, and flanks 

 more deeply fulvous and more heavily streaked, the first with little, if 

 any, red or pink; under wing-coverts and axillars rose pink, as in 

 adults. 



AdAdt female {summer and winter). — Much like the young male, but 

 under wing-coverts and axillars yellow (maize yellow, chrome yellow, 

 or light orange-yellow) instead of rose pink. 



' The red or pink sometimes invades the throat, occasionally occupying the entire 

 gular area; frequently it reaches backward, along the median line, to the abdomen; 

 more rarely the rump is pinkish.

 this case Mexican examples, instead of being the largest, are nearly as small as those 

 from California, the largest being those from the Rocky Mountain district of the 

 United States. There is a great amount of individual variation in all the measure-

As to coloration there is much less of geographic but decidedly more individual 

 variation. Very few examples from California or Lower Califorina are without a 

 more or less distinct postocular tawny streak, a majority of them showing more or 

 less of a median occipital streak or patch of the same color, sometimes extending to 

 the forehead; both these markings are occasionally present in specimens from the 

 Rocky Mountain district, the crown-stripe being conspicuously developed in a speci- 

 men from Fort Union, Nebraska. This style of coloration represents the " var. capi- 

 talis" of Professor Baird, the type of which is from the Columbia River. (No. 873, 

 U. S. Nat. Mus., Columbia River, July 28, 1835; J. K. Townsend. From Audubon's 

 collection.) In Mexican examples the head is usually "solid" black, as in those of 

 the Rocky Mountain district of the United States.

Genus CARDINALIS Bonaparte. 



Cardinalis Bonaparte, Saggio di una Distr. Met. An. Vert., 1831, 53, 141 (nomen 

 nudum); Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837, 111. (Type, Loxia cardinalis Lin-

Rather large, conspicuouslj^ crested, thick-billed Fringillidse, with 

 tail longer than wing, the latter rather short and rounded; adult males 

 bright red, with black eapistrum: adult females with plumage partly 

 red. 



Bill stout, conical, much deeper than broad at base, where its depth 

 is about equal to length of exposed culmen; culmen decidedly, some- 

 times strongly, convex; gonys straight, shorter than distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla; maxillary tomium sinuated a little anterior to

or directl}' beneath nostril, with nearly obsolete subterminal notch or 

 none at all; mandibular tomium either nearly straight or decidedly 

 convex anterior to its subbasal angle, the latter more or less posterior 

 to the middle portion and with or without a notch in front of it. 

 Nostrils nearly or quite concealed by small frontal feathers. Rictal 

 bristles distinct. Wing rather short (about three and a half to three 

 and three-fourths times as long as tarsus), much rounded (seventh to 

 fourth primaries longest, ninth shorter than second); primaries exceed- 

 ing-secondaries l)y less than length of exposed culmen. Tail lono-er 

 than wing, slightly rounded. Tarsus about equal to or a little longer 

 than middle toe with claw, its scutella distinct; latei-al claws not reach- 

 ing to liase of middle claw; hallux decidedly shorter than lateral toes, 

 its claw shoi'ter than the digit. 



Oohirs. — Adult males entirely red, except black around base of bill 

 or on chin {C. phmiici'iis); adult females brownish above, dull tawny 

 or pale bufi'y below, the crest, wings, and tail dull reddish and under 

 wing-coverts pinkish red (except in C '. />ha'ii/'-i'i/>!): 3'oung not streaked. 



Rnnij(>. — More southern United States to British Honduras; coast 

 district of Colombia and Venezuela; Trinidad. 



The evident gap between Ciwdindlix and Pyrrhidoxia is nearly 

 bridged by 6'.J/>A((';//e/■//^s•, which has the culmen strongly convex, the 

 maxillar\' tomium deeply incised (with notch anterior to the nasal 

 fossfe). and the mandibular tomium convex, with its angle only a little 

 posterior to the middle. ^Vere it not that C. canieus exhibits in these 

 features, as well as in its longer and stitfer crest-feathers, an approach 

 to 0. pJui'iucras. I should be disposed to separate the latter generically 

 from ( '. cii/'d/'/ial/'x. C. (Yirneim is, however, much nearer to (■'. cardi- 

 nal Ik than to C. j>hn'/i/'ci'ii-s. 



The geographic distribution of this genus includes two widely 

 separated arcnis; one embracing the Lower Sonoran Province of North 

 America, from the middle Atlantic coast of the United States to the 

 peninsula of Lower California and south through all wooded pai'tsof 

 Mexico, below th(> pine belt, to Yucatan and British Honduras; the other 

 em))ra<ing the northern part of South America, in Venezuela and 

 Colombia. No form of the genus has been found in any part of the 

 intermediate territorv. A distinct type belongs to each of the areas 

 designated, the South American being, as above stated, almost gener- 

 ically distinct from the North American forms. The latter include 

 apparently not more than two species; one of very limited range, con- 

 fined to the coast district of southwestern Mexico, in the States of 

 Guerrero and Oaxaca, the other, modified into a considei*able number 

 of geographic subspecies, occupjang the rest of Mexico and those por- 

 tions of the United States embraced within the area outlined above. 



The specimens of Vai'dimiJis ca/'dhxi/is from all parts of the humid 

 eastern portion of the Lower Sonoran Province of the United States, 

 from New Jerse}' to Kansas, and southward to near the Gulf coast

excepting Florida and tiie immediate coast westward to Louisiana, 

 are practically identical, although examples from the Mississippi Val- 

 ley average more brightly colored in the males and slightly grayer in 

 the females than those from the Atlantic coast district, this varia- 

 tion being carried still further, though by no means to a conspicuous 

 degree, in specimens from Texas and the Mexican States of Tamau- 

 lipas, Nuevo Leon, San Luis Potosi, and Hidalgo. Examples from 

 the peninsula of Florida, however, are noticeably smaller than 

 those from any part of the very extensive area just designated, and 

 are also decidedly darker in color, and constitute a fairly well-marked 

 geographic race, which approaches in its characters the small and 

 intensely colored forms of Yucatan, British Honduras, and adjacent 

 parts of southeastern Mexico. All of the latter are characterized by 

 maximum intensity of coloration, the males being far more intensely 

 red than those from more northern localities or from the western 

 parts of Mexico, the color of the crest being almost as purelj^ red as 

 the under parts, the back being without the grayish margins to the 

 feathers which are always (except in much-worn mid-summer plum- 

 age) conspicuous in specimens from other districts. The females, 

 at the same time, have a richly ochraceous or tawny coloration, with 

 always a very distinct black or grayish black capistrum, which is 

 rarely well marked and never black in other forms. Cardinals of 

 this type include four local modifications: (1) A larger form from the 

 eastern slope of Vera Cruz (C cardinaiis cocdneus); (2) a still larger 

 form from the southern lowlands of Vera Cruz, the males of which 

 have the red of a peculiar rich carmine-red hue ( C. cardivMlis litto- 

 raUs); (3) the Yucatan and British Honduras bird, which is like C. 

 cardinaiis coccineus in color, but much smaller; and (I) the insular 

 form of Cozumel {C cardinaiis saturatvs), which is like the Yucatan 

 form, but larger and darker, with decidedly larger bill and feet. 



There is a wide extent of territory extending from western Texas 

 through New Mexico and southward over a considerable part of the 

 central plateau of Mexico from which no specimens of Cardinaiis have 

 been examined; possibly they do not occur there, unless in limited 

 localities along the eastern and western borders. Immediately west of 

 this area, however, in southern Arizona and southward for an unde- 

 termined distance in northwestern Mexico, the Cardinals {€'. c. super- 

 hus) are much larger than those from any other region. As to colora- 

 tion, they are characterized by conspicuous gray margins to the dorsal 

 feathers (as in eastern examples), a slightly rosy tint of red, and a 

 very narrow and interrupted black frontlet in the males; and the 

 females, instead of having a grayish capistrum, as in all others from 

 the United States, or a black capistrum like those from southern Mexico, 

 have the same marking lighter in color than the adjacent parts, the 

 chin and throat being usually very pale grayish or whitish. This tyt)e 




632 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



of coloration characterizes all western specimens, as far south, at 

 least, as Mazatlan and the Tres Marias Islands; but specimens from 

 the last-named localities are different in other respects, as are also 

 those of the peninsula of Lower California. The latter ( C. c. ignms) 

 are much smaller than Arizona specimens, with relatively shorter bills, 

 and the females less highly colored. The Tres Marias birds (<7. c. 

 marice) are in coloration much like those from Lower California, but 

 are somewhat larger, with decidedly larger bill and feet. 



The foregoing, with the small form of northern Sinaloa and southern 

 Sonora {O. c. affinis), constitute all the geographic forms which we are 

 apparentlj' justified in referring to C. cardinalis, and it seems, after 

 a careful comparison of large series of specimens, that they are clearly 

 but local modifications of one species, of which the C. cocdneus type 

 represents one extreme, the O. igneiis type the other extreme, and the 

 C. cardinalis type an intermediate series. 



In view of the absence of actual proof of intergradation between 

 these three principal types, and such really does not exist in the 

 material which I have been able to bring together, it may seem expedi- 

 ent to some to consider them as specifically distinct. In such case the 

 forms which are here recognized would stand as follows: 



1. Cardinalis cardinalis. (Grayish capistrum in females.) 



n. Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis. 

 h. Cardinalis cardinalis canicaudus. 



c. Cardinalis cardinalis floridanus. 



2. Cardinalis (Mccineus. (Black capistrum in females.) 



a. Cardinalis coccineus coccineus. 

 h. Cardinalis coccineus littoralis. 

 t,. Cardinalis coccineus yucatanicus. 



d. Cardinalis coccineus saturatus. 



3. Cardinalis igneus. (Whitish capistrum in females.) 



a. Cardinalis igneus igneus. 



b. Cardinalis igneus afSnis. 



c. Cardinalis igneus sinaloensis. 



d. Cardinalis igneus marise. 



e. Cardinalis igneus superbus. 



There remains to be considered but a single form, peculiar to the 

 coast district of southwestern Mexico, in the States of Guerrero and 

 Oaxaca, in the latter almost touching the southern range of C. ccwdd- 

 nalis coccineus. This bird ( C. cameiis) is about the smallest of all the 

 North American Cardinals, from all others of which it differs in the 

 form of the bill, the maxilla being relatively more shallow and with 

 less sinuated tomia, and the feathers of the crest much longer as 

 well as stiffer. In coloration the male much resembles the other 

 Cardinals of southern Mexico, but the rump is a much lighter red, 

 while the female is without any red on the outer webs of the primaries, 

 which in the females of all the forms of C. cardinally are distinctly 

 reddish. In all these divergences from C. cardinalis (as a whole) V. 




BIRDS OF NORTH ANB MIDDLE AMERICA. 633 



eameus approaches the South American C. phosniceus, notably in the 

 shape of the bill, its long, stiff crest-feathers, the light-reddish rump 

 of the male, and absence of red on the outer surface of the wing in 

 the female. C. phoeniceus, however, as might be expected from its 

 isolation, is very distinct indeed from all the rest. With a general 

 resemblance to C. cardinalis (including its various forms) and C. 

 carnms, the bill, in both sexes, is grayish instead of bright red; the 

 black capistrum is far less extensive, being restricted to the chin; and 

 the female has the under wing-coverts pale buffy instead of bright 

 pinkish red. The form of the bill is also quite different, being almost 

 intermediate between that of O. cardinalis and that of PyrrhuHoxia 

 sinuata.

 duller; red of head and bod}- replaced above b}^ plain grayish olive or 

 huffy grayish, the crest partly dull red; below by pale fulvous or buffy 

 (nearly white on abdomen), the chest often tinged or mixed with red;

 middle toe, 15.49-17.78 (16.76).' 



Ymmg male. — Somewhat like the adult female, but bill mainly dusky 

 horn color, capistrum obsolete, and under parts more or less clouded 

 or tinged with light vermilion. 



Young female. — Similar to young male, but without admixture of 

 red on under parts. 



[The young retain their immature plumage for only a short time; 

 being immediately after their autumn molt essentially identical in 

 coloration with adults, the only obvious difference consisting in the 

 duller red, or partially dusky, color of the bill.] 



Eastern United States; north, regularly and breeding, to south- 

 eastern New York (Long Island, New York City, Nyack, etc.), lower 



' Thirty-seven specimens. 



Specimens from west of the Allegheny Mountains average slightly different from 

 those taken in the Atlantic coaat district. The males average appreciably brighter 

 in color, the red being more intense and at the same time purer. Females average 

 both paler and grayer. The difference is in the direction of the rather poorly char- 

 acterized subspecies of Texas and northeastern Mexico (C. c. cnnicaudus) , and the 

 Mississippi Valley birds are so completely intermediate between the latter and true 

 C. airdliiali« that they may almost as properly be referred to one as to the other. 



Specimens from South Carolina and Georgia, while averaging a little smaller than 

 those from more northern localities, are clearly referable to true C. rardinalu rather 

 than to the Florida form. 



Separating the series of specimens into three lots, according to the district from 

 whence they were obtained, average measurements are as follows:

The measurements of Louisiana specimens are given above simply for sake of com- 

 parison. The Louisiana bird almost certainly is not true C cardinalis, neither can it 

 be referred without doubt to C. c. flm-idanus; but until more numerous specimens, 

 including females as well as males, have been examined I do not propose to sepa- 

 rate it.

 possibly they constitute a distinct race. (See remarks on Louisiana specimens under

' The expediency of recognizing this as a definable subspecies seems to me some- 

 what doubtful. Taking the most extreme examples, the differences from typical 

 C. cardinalis are perhaps sufficiently marked; but such examples form too small a 

 proportion to warrant us in considering the form a very satisfactory one. There is 

 certainly nothing like the same amount nor constancy of differences that exist in the 

 case of the Florida race or between the several Mexican forms. 



As stated under the head of C. c: cardiiuilis, specimens from the Mississippi Valley 

 in general are practically intermediate between examples from the Atlantic coast , 

 and specimens of C. c. canicaudus from Texas and northeastern Mexico; the males 

 of the Mississippi Valley birds averaging decidedly brighter in color and the 

 females grayer than those from the country east of the AUeghenies. In fact many 

 specimens, of both sexes, from Texas, I am unable to distinguish from other skins 

 from southern Illinois and Indiana, Kentucky, etc. 



Examples from the Mexican States of Nuevo Leon (Monterey and Linares) and 

 San Luis Potosi (Hacienda Angostura) average brighter in color than those from

Texas, the red being appreciably more intense; but while they thus approach C. c. 

 coccineus they may at once be distinguished from that form by their decidedly 

 smaller and less turgid bill, very much duller red crest, and, except in worn post- 

 nuptial dress, very distinct grayish margins to the feathers of the back. Females 

 from localities in the same States and also one from Hidalgo (Tula, March 9, no. 

 144311, TJ. S. Nat. Mus., E. W. Nelson, collector) are quite indistmguishable from 

 Texan females; in fact, they can be very closely matched by several specimens from 

 southern Illinois and Indiana. 



' The specimens examined from Guanajuato were evidently cage birds, since they 

 all show the peculiar light buff-yellow markings on head, neck, and chest said to be 

 produced artificially by the Indian bird fanciers of that district. The specimens 

 were all males, no females having been examined. These artificially yellow-markeu 

 birds represent the C. flavonotatus of Euss (see synonymy, page 641).

Similar to 0. c. cardinalis but decidedly smaller and darker; adult 

 male with terminal margins of feathers of back, etc., distinctly oliva- 

 ceous instead of gray, the red of under parts, etc. , deeper or darker, 

 without the purity of red of western (Mississippi Valley and Texan)

This form, of which nearly 150 adult specimens have been examined, shows a dis- 

 tinct approach toward the characters of the forms of southeastern Mexico, especially 

 those of Yucatan and Cozumel. It is apparently entirely restricted to the peninsula 

 of Florida. 



Four adult male Cardinals from New Orleans, Madison ville, and Covington, Louisi- 

 ana, obtained in November and December, resemble Florida males very closely in 

 coloration, though the red is rather purer; but they have much larger bills, larger 

 feet, and relatively longer wings and shorter tail, the average measurements compar- 

 ing with those of Florida specimens, as follows: 



The bill is, in fact, decidedly larger in these Louisiana birds than in any other 

 specimens from the United States east of Arizona, and I have little doubt that it will

/ ' This specimen is undoubtedly either from the State of Vera Cruz or the contigu- 

 ous portion of the State of Oaxaca, since it agrees exactly with examples from that 

 district in the collection of tlie Biological Survey (Department of Agriculture). 

 It was received by the Smithsonian Institution, In 1863, from M. Salle, and on 

 the original label bears the following, apparently in Jlr. A. Boucard's handwriting, 

 " Cardinalis virginianus Lin. cameus Less. E. Z., p. 210, Mexique," and on the reverse 

 side, "No. 100." Boucard made collections for M.Salle at Playa Vicente, Oaxaca, 

 in 1858, and "Cardinalis virginianus" is named in Dr. Sclater' s list of Boucard's col- 

 lection (Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, p. 378). Possibly, therefore, this specimen, 

 which I have selected as the type of C. c. coccineus, is from Boucard's Playa Vicente

Large stout-billed Fringillidaj with short and much-rounded wing, 



tail about as long as wing and much rounded, and small feet (tarsus a 



, little longer than culmen, measured from extreme base, and middle toe 



with claw decidedly shorter than tarsus); coloration mostly plain slate, 



with some black and white, the bill red (yellowish in dried skins). 



Bill stout, turgid-conical, much deeper than broad at base, its basal 

 depth decidedly greater than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; 

 cuhnen strongly convex, nearly as long (from extreme base), as tar- 

 sus; gonys straight, a little shorter than distance from nostril to tip 

 of maxilla; maxilla and mandible about equal in depth; maxillary 



' It is possible the Oaxaca birds referred to this species may require separation 

 from those found in the States of Guerrero and Colima, but the series I have been 

 able to examine is too small to enable me to form a decided opinion in the matter. 

 The three males from Tehuantepec have decidedly longer bills than the one from 

 Acapulco or the two from Colima, and the same difference is observable between two 

 females from the first two named localities; the culmen in birds from Tehuantepec 

 measuring from 18.80-20.07 (averaging 19.56), in those from Acapulco and Colima 

 only 17.27-18.54 (averaging 18.03) . The Tehuantepec males also appear to have the 

 black on the forehead broader. The principal reason, however, for suspecting the 

 existence of two forms is the very marked difference between the two females from 



, Tehuantepec and Acapulco, respectively. That from Tehuantepec has the capistrum 

 quite black and very sharply defined, while that from Acapulco has the capistrum 



I dusky grayish and without sharp outlines.

tomium strongly convex or lobed (sometimes prominently toothed or 

 angulated) between middle and tip, concave subbasally, with or without 

 an obvious notch near tip; mandibular tomium nearly straight for most 

 of its length, or else convex subterminally and concave in middle por- 

 tion, the basal third abruptly deflected, but the angle thus produced not 

 distinctly toothed nor notched. Nostrils small, broadly oval, obliquely 

 vertical or nearly circular, nearly concealed by the dense frontal feath- 

 ers. Rictal bristles distinct. Wing rather short (a little more than 

 four times as long as the short tarsus), much rounded (eighth to fifth 

 primaries longest, the ninth not longer than fourth, sometimes shorter 

 than second); primaries exceeding secondaries by less than length of 

 exposed culmen. Tail about as long as wing, much rounded, the rectri- 

 ces rather broad, with compact webs and rounded but somewhat nar- 

 rowed tips. Tarsus longer than culmen (from extreme base), decidedly 

 longer than middle toe with claw (grossus) or shorter {fuligim>mH)\ 

 lateral claws reaching about to base of middle claw; hallux decidedly 

 shorter than lateral toes, its claw shorter than the digit. 



Colors. — Uniform dark bluish gray or slaty, with white under wing- 

 coverts, and sometimes with white on throat; adult males with chest 

 and more or less of head black. 



Range. — Nicaragua to southeastern Brazil and western Ecuador. 



I have been obliged to eliminate from this genus sundry species 

 which have usually been referred to it, but which appear to be very 

 different in structure. These I place among the genera Oaryothraustes, 

 Shodothraupis, and Periparphyrus. Pitylus, as thus restricted, seems 

 more nearly related to Cardinal/is than to the forms mentioned, the 

 bill being exceedingly similar and the nostrils similarly almost con- 

 cealed by the frontal feathers, although the very different coloration 

 and the absence of a crest in Pityhis give the two genera a very dif- 

 erent appearance.

Genus CARYOTHRAUSTES Reichenbaeh. 



Caryothraustes Eeichenbach, Av. Syst. Nat., 1850, pi. 78. (Type, Cocmthraustes 

 viridis Vieillot. ) 



Short-tailed, thick- billed Fring.illidiv^ with the maxilla distinctly 

 uncinate at tip, notched subterminally, and swollen laterally, the nos- 

 trils wholly exposed, and the plumage partlj' 3^ellow. 



Bill decidedly shorter than head, thick and turgid, with lateral out- 

 lines distinctly convex or bowed, except terminally, the tip of the 

 maxilla slightly but distinctlj^ uncinate; culmen strongl}^ convex, nearly 

 equal (from extreme base) to length of tarsus; gonys nearly equal to 

 length of maxilla from nostril (except in C. hnmeralls), straight; maxil- 

 lary tomium distinctly notched subterminally, then gently deflected 

 in a nearly straight line to about half as far as the nostril, where 

 inclined upward, forming a more or less prominent, rounded, median 

 lobe, behind which the tomium is first more or less deeply concave, 

 then decidely deflected to the rictus (more gradually so in 0. hu/neralis); 

 mandibular tomium more or less convex near tip, then nearly straight 

 to the distinct angular notch immediately in front of the subbasal 

 angle. Nostril wholly exposed, oval, obliquely horizontal, with 

 rather broad superior membrane. Rictal bristles inconspicuous. Wing 

 moderate (a little more than four to more than four and a half times as 

 long as tarsus), slightly roundisd (eighth to tixth primaries longest, 

 ninth longer than third, sometimes longer than fourth); primaries 

 exceeding secondaries by length of exposed culmen or more (much 

 more in O. humeralis). Tail much shorter than wing (difference 

 exceeding length of tarsus), even {C. viriflts, C. irasiliens/'-^ or slightly 

 rounded {C. poliogaster and C humrrnlis), the rectrices rather nar- 

 row, contracted or obtusely pointed or rounded at tip. Tarsus slightly 

 longer than middle toe with claw; lateral claws reaching about to base 

 of middle claw; hind claw much shorter than its digit, strongly curved, 

 grooved laterally. 



Coloration. — Prevailing color above plain olive-green, beneath partly 

 or wholly yellow; lores and thence to chin and upper throat black, or 

 else {C. Immeralis) pileum gray and malar region and middle line of 

 throat white barred with black; in C. poliogaster posterior parts, both 

 above and below, gray. Sexes alike. 



Bcunge. — Southern Mexico to Brazil. 



There is considerable difference between O. viridis (and its subspecies 

 C. V. Irasiliensis) on the one hand and 0. poliogaster on the other in 

 the proportions of the bill, that of the latter being much broader and 

 more turgid, with the maxillary tomium more strongly lobed, and the 

 mandibular tomium more strongly and abruptly deflected basally. 0. 

 humeralis Lawrence is still more different.

 and breast, yellow (lemon or gamboge), purest on forehead and lower 

 throat, elsewhere more or less tinged with olive, especially on occiput 

 and hindneck, which incline more or less strongly to olive-green; upper 

 back, wings, and tail yellowish olive-green; scapulars, lower back, 

 rump, and upper tail-coverts plain slate-gray; sides and flanks light 

 gray, fading into paler gray or grayish white on abdomen; under tail- 

 coverts pale brownish graj^ centrally, broadly margined with dull buffy

Similar to Caryothraiistes but tail much longer (nearly as long as 

 wing) and decidedly rounded; ninth primary not longer than second, 

 instead of longer than third; tarsus decidedly longer than middle toe 

 with claw. Sexes different in color, though similar in pattern, the 

 adult male being dull carmine red below and across hindneck, other- 

 wise, including head (all round) and chest, black; adult female and 

 immature male with head and chest black, otherwise plain olive-green, 

 more yellowish on under parts and hindneck. 

 Range. — Eastern Mexico. (Monotypic.) { 



While bearing a strong superficial resemblance in coloration to Peri- 

 parphynis,^ this genus is exceedingly distinct in structure, in which 

 respect it is much more nearly related to Caryothr amies. The bill is 

 less different in form from that of C. viridis or O. poliogaster than 

 these are from one another, but the nostril appears to be more rounded 

 than in either, with less of an overhanging membrane. Bhodothraujns 

 agrees with Periporphyrus in lengthened and distinctly rounded tail, 

 and, to a degree, in the pattern of coloration, but the bill is exceed- 

 ingly different in form.

Genus SALTATOR Vieillot. 



Saltatory lEihUiT, Analyse, 1816, 32. (Type, ['Grand Tangurii, Buff. ," = Tanai/ra 

 magna Gmelin. ) 



Large, plainly colored Fringillidse, with tail nearlj^ if not quite as 

 long as wing, rounded; tarsus not conspicuously if at all longer than 

 middle toe with claw; bill rather large, usually elongate-conical, with 

 tip of maxilla more or less distinctly decurved and produced into a 

 distinct hook or point with distinct tomial notch behind it; maxillary 

 tomium not distinctly sinuate or lobed, and subbasal portion of man- 

 dibular tomium not angulated nor toothed; upper parts plain olive- 

 green, brown, or brownish gray (pileum sometimes black); under parts 

 plain grayish, passing into fulvous posteriorly, the throat white or 

 pale fulvous, or else under parts streaked with olive. 



Bill elongate-conical, with maxilla rather strongly decurved termi- 

 nally, its tip forming a distinct point or nngius, with distinct tomial 

 notch immediately behind; basal depth of bill less than distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla, decidedly greater than basal width ; culmen 

 moderately convex, more strongly so terminally; gonys straight or 

 very slightly convex, its length less than basal depth of bill; maxil- 

 lary tomium not distinctly sinuated nor lobed, its basal portion not 

 abraptly nor very strongly deflexed; mandibular tomium nearly 

 straight for most of its length, the subbasal portion not angulated nor 

 toothed,' but gradually rounded to the rictus, the terminal portion 

 more or less beveled off to the point of the mandible. Nostril 

 exposed, small, roundish, in anterior portion of nasal fosses, overhung 

 by rather distinct membrane; nasal fossae feathered to posterior edge 

 of nostrils. Rictal bristles obvious but rather small. Wing moderate, 

 rounded, the tip much shorter than tarsus; seventh to fifth primaries 

 longest, the outermost (ninth) shorter than third, usually shorter than 

 second. Tail nearly if not quite as long as wing, rounded. Tarsus 

 rather stout, longer than commissure, less than to a little more than 

 one-fourth as long as wing, its scutella distinct; middle toe, with 

 claw, about as long as tarsus, or slightly shorter; lateral toes, with 

 claws, reaching about to base of middle claw; hallux about as long as 

 lateral toes but much stouter, its claw much shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive-green, oli^^e, or brownish gray, the 

 pileum sometimes black; beneath plain grayish or buffy grayish, 

 passing into fulvous posteriorly, the throat more or less extensively 

 white or white and fulvous; a white superciliary stripe (yellow in 

 young); sometimes a black "collar" across chest. 



'Except in some South American species which, though usually referred to this 

 genus, are probably generically distinct (for example, S. auraniiiroslrisNi&iWot, S. atri- 

 coUis Vieillot, and S. laiiclavius Sclater and Salvin). These have typically fringilline 

 bills, the commissure being abruptly deflexed basally and the subbasal portion of 

 the mandibular tomium distinctly angulated.

Range. — Southern Mexico to southern Brazil, etc.; Lesser Antilles 

 (islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Santa Lucia). 



The above diagnosis is drawn up from the Central American spe- 

 cies (exclusive of H. alhicollis Vieillot) and certain South American 

 species which are unquestionably congeneric with them. I am very 

 doubtful whether S. albicollis should be placed in this genus, the dif- 

 ference in the form of the bill and style of coloration being very con- 

 spicuous, though for the present I leave it there. Several South 

 American species which have hitherto been referred to Saltator, 

 mainly on account of, their strong resemblance in coloration, should 

 undoubtedly be removed. One of them {S. maxillosus Cabanis) has 

 already been made the type of a distinct genus,^ characterized, in 

 part, by the transvei'se, file-like corrugation of the under surface of 

 the maxilla.

 BLACK-HEADED SALTATOK, 



Adults {sexes alike). — Pileum uniform black, sharply defined poste- 

 riorly; sides of head mostly black, becoming grayish or mixed black 

 and gray on suborbital and part of malar region; a gray superciliary 

 stripe, beginning on anterior portion of forehead and extending beyond 

 eyes (sometimes confluent with gray on sides of neck), becoming 

 white immediately above eyes; back, scapulars, wings, rump, upper 

 tail-coverts, and tail bright yellowish olive-green, brightest on tail, 

 which is rich olive-yellow in some lights; shafts of rectrices and remiges 

 black; inner webs of remiges dusky, also the narrower terminal portion 

 of longer primaries; chin and sides of throat (broadly) black, confluent 

 posteriorly with a broad semicircular collar of black across chest; 

 inclosed within this black marking a large throat-patch (pointed ante- 

 riorly, broad and convex posteriorly) of white, usually finely streaked 

 with black, sometimes tinged with gray posteriorly,^ breast and other 

 under parts of body ash gray, becoming slightly paler posteriorly, 

 where tinged with brown on flanks, the thighs more decidedly brown 

 or light olive; under tail-coverts orange-ochraceous, the feathers more 

 olivaceous centrally; bill black; legs and feet (in dried skins) horn 

 brownish.

'Six specimens from Isthmus of Panama. 



^A series of fourteen adults from San Miguel Island in the collection of Messrs. E. A. 

 and 0. Bangs, collected April 27 to May 7, shows decided color differences from an equally 

 large aeries from the mainland, the under parts having much legs of the olive-yellowish 

 wash across chest and along sides, and the streaks grayer. The upper parts are also 

 grayer, especially anteriorly. In the absence of specimens of corresponding date 

 from the mainland of the Isthmus (none of the specimens fro© the latter having 

 been obtained later than March 25 ), I am unable to determine whether the differ- 

 ences are seasonal or otherwise. Average measurements of the mainland and island 

 specimens, together with specimens of S. a. albicollis, are as follows:

SALTATOR GUADELUPENSIS Lafresnaye. 

 GUADELOUPE SALTATOE. 



Similar to S. albicolKs isthmicxis but larger, under parts more gen- 

 erally suffused with olive-grayish and yellowish and with streaks much 

 less distinct (sometimes nearly obsolete), and whitish or yellow super- 

 ciliary streak continued posteriorly to occiput. 



Adfults {sexes oLihe). — Above olive-green, slightly duller on pileum, 

 tinged with gray on scapulars and lower back; rump, upper tail-cov- 

 erts, and tail brownish gray ; sides of head olive (much duller than 

 pileum, sometimes tinged with dusky grayish, especially on lores), 

 relieved by a whitish or pale yellowish superciliary streak extending 

 from above lores to sides of occiput; chin and throat white medially 

 (usually tinged with pale grayish posteriorly and sometimes faintly 

 tinged with yellowish), this white area margined on each side by an 

 olive, grayish, or dusky submalar stripe; rest of under parts pale 

 grayish olive, becoming dull white on abdomen, the chest more or less 

 washed or tinged with yellowish olive or olive-yellowish; chest marked 

 with narrow and usually indistinct streaks of dusky grayish, the 

 breast and anterior portion of sides with still narrower and more indis- 

 tinct streaks; under tail-coverts, anal region, and lower abdomen pale 

 huffy, the first usually with narrow shaft-streaks of grayish dusky; 

 basal half or more of maxilla and sides of mandible for about the same 

 distance dusky; rest of bill whitish or pale j-ellowish (in dried skins) ;^ 

 legs and feet (in dried skins) horn color. 



Young. — Similar to adults, but superciliary streak distinctly light 

 yellow, and lower throat, chest, upper bi'east, and anterior portion of 

 sides much more distinctly and broadly streaked with greenish olive on 

 a more whitish ground color.

I have carefully examined Bermuda Cardinals and can not find that 

 they differ from mainland examples; nor should they, for the species 

 is said to have been intTodmced from the eastern United States.

Note concerning measurements. — All of the measurements in this 

 volume were originally made in inches and hundredths, but at the last 

 moment, after the manuscript had been completed, the author decided, 

 in view of the increasing use of the metric system among naturalists, 

 to have them converted into millimeters. This was accordingly done, 

 and the measurements as printed are the exact metric equivalents of 

 the original figures. For practical purposes the reader may of course 

 ignore fractions under .5 of a millimeter.
