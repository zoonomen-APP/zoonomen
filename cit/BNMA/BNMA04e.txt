PREFACE. 



Unavoidable circumstances have delayed the completion of this 

 volume until the present time. 



Part I, issued in 1901, included the Famil}^ Fringillida? (Finches) 

 alone. Part II, issued in 1902, included the Families Tanagridjp, 

 (Tanao-ers), Icterid* (Troupials), Coerebida? (Honey Creepers), and 

 Mniotiltidai (Wood Warblers). Part III, published in 1904, included 

 the Motacillidse (Wagtails and Pipits), Hirundinidas (Swallows), Am- 

 pelid?e (Waxwings), Ptilogonatidte (Silky Flycatchers), Dulidfe (Palm 

 Chats), Vireonidje (Vireos), Laniidse (Shrikes), Corvid^ (Crows and 

 Jays), Paridee (Titmice), Sittidse (Nuthatches), Certhiidaj (Creepers), 

 Troglodytidas (Wrens), Cinclidaj (Dippers), Chamteidaj (Wren-Tits), 

 and Sylviidte (Warblers). The present volume comprises the Turdidaj 

 (Thrushes), Zeledoniidse (Wren-Thrushes), Mimidse (Mockingbirds), 

 SturnidiB (Starlings), Ploceidie (Weaver Birds), Alaudidas (Larks), 

 OxyruncidjB (Sharp-bills), Tyrannidte (Tyrant Flycatchers), Pipridte 

 (Manakins), and Cotingidee (Chatterers). Part V, which is partly 

 done, includes the FormicariidiB (Ant Birds), Dendrocolaptid* (Wood- 

 Hewers), Furnariidte (Oven Birds-), Pteroptochidte (Tapacolas), Tro- 

 chilidge (Humming Birds), Micropodidte (Swifts), Caprimulgid^e 

 (Goatsuckers), and Picidse (Woodpeckers). 



In the four volumes published there have been described 1,675 

 species and subspecies, or somewhat more than half the total number 

 of North and Middle American Birds. 



Acknowledgments are due for the loan of specimens used in the 

 preparation of this volume to those individuals and public institutions 

 mentioned in preceding volumes; also to the Carnegie Museum, of 

 Pittsburg, Pennsylvania (through Mr. W. E. Clyde Todd, in charge 

 of the bird collection); the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cam- 

 bridge, Massachusetts (through Mr. William Brewster); Dr. Louis B. 

 Bishop, of New Haven, Connecticut; Mr. J. H. Fleming, of Toronto, 

 Canada, and Mr. Arthur T. Wayne, of Mount Pleasant, South Caro- 

 lina. The specimens from the Carnegie Museum were especially help- 

 ful, consisting of tine series of beautifully prepared specimens, mostly 

 from Costa Rica. 



It is a great pleasure to the author to have this opportunit}^ of 

 expressing his obligations foi- the privilege of studying the very com-

plete collection (numbering some 15,000 specimens) of Costa Rican 

 birds belonging- to the National Museum of Costa Rica, at San Jose, 

 where a commodious and convenient workroom and free access to the 

 specimens were placed at his service; and it is also a great pleasure to 

 refer to the indispensable assistance rendered by Don Anastasio Alfaro, 

 Director of the Museum, and Don Jose C. Zeledon, of San Jose, 

 during the author's six months' sojourn in that country collecting 

 material for the present woi"k. 



The illustrations in this volume not previously published were 

 mostly made by Mr. H. W. Hendley, of Washington, District of 

 Columbia, and the measurements of specimens were made chiefly by 

 Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Division of Birds.

THE BIRDS 



NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 



By Robert Ridgway, 



Curator, Division of Birds. 



Part IV. 



Family TURDID^. 



THE THRUSHES. 



Slender-billed or small-billed, ten-primaried aciitiplantar Oscines, 

 having the acrotarsium undivided or "booted," except for lower por- 

 tion, and the young in first plumage more or less distinctly spotted 

 above as well as below, '^ even in species which are unspotted in the 

 adult stage. 



The preceding brief diagnosis is sufficient to distinguish the Tur- 

 didsd, as usually restricted, from the most nearly related groups of 

 slender-billed, ten-primaried Oscines, with the single exception of 

 the so-called family Muscicapidse (Flycatchers), an exclusively Old 

 World group, with which the Turdidse are nearly if not quite con- 

 nected by the Palsearctic genus Pratincola and related groups, the 

 Hawaiian genus Phseornis, the genera of the American so-called Mya- 

 destinse,^ and other transitional forms. In fact, no satisfactory line 



a In some of the Neotropical species of Planesticus, in several species of Catharus, 

 and in the Antillean genera Mimocichla and Ha-plocichla the young are very indis- 

 tinctly spotted, the spotting being confined on some of them to the under parts. In 

 the young of Zeledonia there is no trace of spotting in any portion of the plumage, and 

 the same may almost ])e said of the young of Catharus gracilirostris. Tlie value of this 

 character as diagnostic of the Turdidse is therefore much less than has generally been 

 supposed. (See remarks with reference to Phainoptila, under Family Ptilogonatidae, 

 on page 113, Part III, of the present work.) 



b The genus Myadestes grades so completely into Planesticus, through genera of vari- 

 ously intermediate structure that, unless osteological or other anatomical characters 

 may be found, it certainly cannot properly be considered as representing a group of 

 subfamily rank.

has ever been drawn between the two groups, and there is much reason 

 for doubting: whether their separation can be maintained. The only 

 other groups to which the Turdidae are intimately related are the 

 Mimidse (Mocking Thrushes) and Cinclidas (Dippers). The former 

 have often been included with the Turdidaj as a subfamily (Miminse) ; 

 but their more or less distinctly scutellate acrotarsium, relatively 

 larger hallux, more rounded wing, with relatively longer outermost 

 (tenth) primary, and weaker or fewer rictal bristles, will serve to 

 separate them as a fairly well-defined family group.'* The Cinclida' 

 are much too different to need close comparison with the Turdidfe, 

 and ma}', therefore, be dismissed without further notice.^ 



The folk)wing osteological characters are said to be diagnostic of 

 the Turdidse as distinguished from the Mimidse: — 



Ante-orbital region wide; descending process of nasal w^ide, the 

 angle formed by this process and the pars jtlana acute; maxillo- 

 palatines of a modified claviform shape; costal process of sternum 

 large, blunt, rhomboidal in outline; coracoid with a wide flange run- 

 ning halfway up the shaft; pelvis broad, flattened.'^ 



Authors have varied greatly in the limits which they have assigned 

 the family Turdidse, as they have respectively defined it. Mr. Henry 

 Seebohm, author of that volume of the ''Catalogue of the Birds in the 

 British Museum" '^ which contains the group includes in his "Family 

 Turdidse," besides the true thrushes, the w^arblers (Sylviidse) as a 

 "subfamily Sylviinse," but excludes the "Myadestinse," the Mimidse, 

 and the genus Pratincola. In a later special paper on the group* 

 Doctor Stejneger has recast the limits of the family by adding to it the 

 " Myadestinae " (as suggested by Professor Baird in his "Review of 

 American birds," 1866, p. 417), and the genus Pratincola (in accord- 

 ance with the views of many previous authors), and removing the Syl- 

 viidse. The family Turdidae, therefore, as defined by Doctor Stejneger, 

 whose views are here adopted, is equivalent to Mr. Seebohm's "Sub- 



o- It is true that not all the characters mentioned above as diagnostic of the Mimidse 

 invariably occur in the same genus; but one or another of them at least is always 

 present to determine which of the two groups a given form should be referred to.

family Turdinse'' plus the Myadestinse of authors;'^ and I quite agree 

 with Doctor Stejneger that ''the definition of the group Turdidae ( = 

 Seebohm's Turdinse), given by Mr. Seebohm, seems to be a very proper 

 one," and expresses "the only chief character which really indicates 

 the relationship of the birds to be included in this family." As Doctor 

 Stejneger remarks, "The peculiar spotted first plumage of the Tur- 

 dida:" is a A^ery striking feature, and its coincidence with booted tarsi 

 very remarkable. A careful comparison with forms, which, without 

 showing those characters, have at different times been referred to the 

 Turdidse, will convince us that the limits traced by Mr. Seebohm are 

 the only reliable ones, and that the family thus defined is a very natu- 

 ral group, and, indeed, one of the best among the Passeres. It is 

 only to be regretted that Mr. Seebohm did not include a few other 

 forms which have the same peculiarities. I may especially allude to 

 the Myadestinae, the position of which will be discussed in fidl below. 

 His concluding remarks on page 2 seem, however, to indicate that he 

 himself has been aware of this fault." 



Mr. Seebohm's definition of the characters of his "Subfamily Tur- 

 dina^" applies quite as well to the family Turdidae in its revised sense, 

 and is so concise in its reference to the diagnostic characters presented 

 by the plumage of the young and peculiarities of the molt that a better 

 one could scarcely be framed. It is as follows: 



Tnrdinx. — The young in first plumage differ from the adult in having the upper 

 and the under parts spotted, whether that is or is not the case in the adult. Instead 

 of two molts in the year there is only one, in autumn, the spring plumage being 

 obtained l)y abrasion, or by casting the points of the feathers. Where any feathers 

 have become much worn by the spring, they are replaced by new ones, but nothing 

 approaching a complete molt is observable. Under these circumstances the young 

 birds would have to carry their nestling plumage, or the gi'eater part of it, until the 

 second autumn. To avoid this they have a complete molt, from immature plumage 

 to adult, in their first autumn before they migrate. Consequently the winter plumage 

 of the young and adult is the same, and they can generally only be distinguished by 

 an isolated feather here and there, generally on the wing-coverts or innermost sec- 

 ondaries, which have a pale tip as in the immature plumage. These peculiarities of 

 molting appear in this group of birds to be always associated with a plain tarsus, 

 except occasionally in very young birds of one or two species. 



The Turdidse comprise a great variety of forms which, though all 

 possessing the characters given above as diagnostic of the group, pre- 

 sent wide differences in general appearance, form and coloration, and 

 habits. They may be arboreal, terrestrial, or saxicoline; frugivorous 

 or insectivorous — though many kinds feed both upon fruits and 

 berries and insects ; plainly colored or of brilliant hues, though the 

 latter is exceptional, the former being the rule. The family is remark- 

 able for the number of excellent songsters which it contains, several 



a To which I add the genera Zeledonia and Phxornis, the former unknown at the 

 time Doctor Stejneger's article was published, the latter not mentioned by him.

of them, as the Nightingale, the Song Thrush, and the Blackbird 

 (Planesticus merula) being renowned in this respect, while the 

 American Wood Thrushes (genus Hylocichla) and some of the Night- 

 ingale Thrushes (genus Catharus) and Solitaires (genus Myadestes) 

 are scarcely less remarkable for the quality of their melody. 



The Turdidse, as a group, are nearly cosmopolitan, only ])arts of 

 Polynesia being without representatives.'* They are most numer- 

 ously represented in the extensive area of the Pahearctic Region, 

 which possesses many peculiar genera; but the family is well devel- 

 oped in America, especially in the mountainous districts extending 

 from Mexico to the central Andes, the total number of species and 

 subspecies now known to occur in America being about one hundred 

 and fifty, belonging to nineteen genera. ^ 



KEY TO THE AMERICAN GENERA OP TURDID.E.C 



a. Bill relatively longer, narrower, and more couipi-essed, its width at frontal antise 

 little if any greater than its height at same point and decidedly less than length 

 of gouys; the latter nearly if not quite equal to half the distance from point ef- 

 mandible to malar apex (if less than the latter the tail even). 

 b. Wing less than five times as long as tarsus; middle toe (without claw) less than 

 three-fourths as long as tarsus. 

 c. Middle toe (without claw) not more than three-fifths as long as tarsus, or else 

 (Cichlherminia, part) tarsus nearly half as long as wing. 

 d. Bill relatively smaller and more slender, the exposed culmen not more 

 (usually much less) than half as long as tarsus; wing less than 115 mm. 

 e. Tail much longer than combined length of tarsus and middle toe (without 

 claw), the rectrices 12; wing at least two and a half times as long as 

 tarsus; outermost (tenth) primary obvious, sometimes half as long as 

 ninth (usually much less). 

 /. Exposed culmen longer than inner toe with claw: rump and l)usal por- 

 tion of tail white Saxicola (p. 8) 



ff. Exposed culmen shorter than inner toe with claw; rump not white; 

 no white on base of tail, or else {Calliope, part) a scarlet patch on 

 throat of male. 

 y. Mandible narrower basally, with gonys longer than the rami. 



h. Tail more or less rounded, with rectrices broader, tapering rather 



than widening terminally, the shafts of lateral pair parallel or 



convergent terminally in closed tail. 



i. Tarsus half as long as tail, or longer; plumage more or less varied, 



adult males having blue or scarlet on thi-oat and a whitish 



superciliary stripe, adult females with the latter jiresent but 



less developed. 



alt is possible that the New Zealand genus Turnagra does not belong here, in 

 which case that country also would be unrepresented. Some doubt also attaches to 

 the supposed Australian members of the group. 



''In Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe's "Hand-List of Birds'*' (iv, 1903, 111-184) the total 

 number of species listed for the entire world (including subspecies, no distinction 

 being made) is very nearly six hundred, referred to seventy-five genera. It is pos- 

 sible, however, that a few of the genera may eventually be excluded from the Turdidte. 



c Several allied Paltearctic genera and one Hawaiian genus are introduced into the 

 key for the purpose of comparison with the most nearly related American forms.

 ideas as to the paramount value of color characters in the Turdidse (see p. viii of the 

 volume cited) should go in his "genus" Geocichla!

 identical or not. According to descriptions of the former, however, they seem to be 

 very different; and taking into consideration Hartlaub's statement (Rev. Zool., 1846, 

 3) that Lesson's bird is Aulia hypopyrrha (Vieillot) I think the name Cichlopsis Cabanis 

 should be used for the genus until it is clearly shown that some other name has 

 indisputable claim to replace it.

« The above characters are taken from S. ananthe, S. ynontana, S. lugens, S. stapa- 

 zina, and S. oreophila. These differ from one another to a greater or less extent in 

 structural details, principally the relation of length of wing, tail, tarsus, and middle 

 toe and wing-formula, but I would consider them as congeneric. Possibly certain of 

 the numerous species usually referred to the geniis may require removal, but the 

 present work has nothing to do with them.

 parte =«r»rdws aurantiirostris Hartlaub.) 

 Malacocichla Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1854, 285. (Type, M. dryas Gould.) 

 Malacocychla (emendation) Bonaparte, Compt. Rend., Ixiii, 1856, 998. 



Small, long-legged, roimded-winged Turdidse with wing less than 

 two and a half to nearly three times as long.as tarsus, the latter much 

 more than twice as long as exposed culmen; outermost (tenth) pri- 

 mary decidedly longer than primary coverts, sometimes more than 

 half as long as ninth, the latter never longer than fourth, sometimes 

 not longer than first; upper parts plain brown, olive, gray, or dusky, 

 the head sometimes black; under parts whitish, grayish, or pale 

 brownish, the chest sometimes spotted. 



Bill much shorter than head, variable as to relative thickness; 

 exposed culmen always decidedly less than half as long as tarsus 

 (never longer than outer toe with claw), straight basally, then gradu- 

 ally and increasingly decurved toward tip, sometimes straight for basal 

 half or more; gonys faintly convex, ascending terminally, not shorter 

 than mandibular rami (usually longer); maxillar^^ tomium nearly 

 straight, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril oval or ovate, 

 overhung by membrane (more or less broad), posteriorly usually in 

 contact with (sometimes partly covered by) feathering of frontal 

 antise. Rictal bristles very distinct; feathers of chin and lores 

 (especially the former) with distinct bristle-like tips. Wing moderate 

 to rather short (less than two and a half to nearly three times as long 

 as tarsus), the longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries by not 

 more than half the length of tarsus, usually much less; outermost 

 (tenth) primary much longer than primary coverts, sometimes much 

 more than half as long as ninth, the latter never longer than fourth, 

 sometimes not longer than first; the seventh and sixth, seventh, 

 sixth, and fifth or sixth longest. Tail decidedly shorter than wing, 

 usually slightly shorter than distance from bend of wing to end of 

 secondaries (longer in ( . occidentalis) , usually slightly rounded (even 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 19 



or very faintly emarginate in C. occidental/is), the rectrices with 

 extreme tip minutely acuminate. Tarsus long and slender, much 

 more than twice as long as exposed culmen, the acrotarsium with 

 both sides undivided; middle toe (without claw) three-fifths as long 

 as tarsus or slightly less; lateral toes unequal, the inner (without 

 claw) reaching to subterminal articulation of middle toe, the outer 

 slightly beyond; hallux equal to inner toe or slightly shorter; basal 

 phalanx of middle toe united for more than basal half to outer toe, for 

 less than half to inner toe; claws normal, that of hallux shorter than 

 its digit. 



Coloration. — Above plain brown, olive, or slaty; if brown or olive, 

 the pileum sometimes grayish or more refescent, or wings and tail 

 more rufescent; if slaty, the pileum blackish; under parts whitish (at 

 least on abdomen), becoming brownish or grayish on chest, sides, and 

 flanks, or gray with olive or fulvous across chest; chest sometimes 

 spotted; sexes alike. 



Nidijication. — Nest (of C. melpomene) open above, composed 

 chiefly of moss; eggs (of C. melpomene) white or very pale bluish, 

 speckled or spotted, more or less densely, with reddish brown. 



Range. — Confined to tropical portions of American continent 

 (northern Mexico to Bolivia and northern Peru) ; apparently wanting 

 from lower Amazon district (including Guiana) and Brazilian district. 

 (About twenty species and subspecies.) 



The present genus is closely related to HylocicMa, with which it 

 very nearly intergrades through C. oceidentalis and other species. 

 Like the Hylociclilm the species, except C. melpomene, are mostly birds 

 of the mountain forests, living near the ground. All are songsters of 

 greater or less merit, the song of C. frantzii reminding one strongly of 

 that of the famed Hermit Thrush (HylocicJila guttata paJlasi) which it 

 furthermore closely resembles in its habits. C. melpomene costa- 

 ricensis, however, is a bird of the open cultivated districts and its 

 song is unattractive.

 GOULD'S NIGHTINGALE THRUSH. 



Adult male. — Head, except chin and throat, uniform black; hind- 

 neck, back, scapulars, wing-coverts, rump, and upper tail-coverts, 

 plain brownish slate color (between slate color and mouse gray), the 

 last sometimes more brownish; remiges and rectriees darker (dusky) 

 with brownish slate colored edgings, these paler and more brownish 

 on terminal portion of longer primaries; under parts, including chin 

 and throat, yellowish w^hite, more or less strongly tinged with buff- 

 yellow'* on chest and lower throat, passing into slate-gray on sides 

 and flanks; chest (sometimes breast also) spotted with slate-gray or 

 brownish slate; bill, naked eyelids, legs, and feet yellowish (bright yel- 

 low or orange in life); length (skins), 167-188 (177); wing, 96-97.5 

 (96.7); tail, 71.5-73 (72.2); exposed culmen, 16; tarsus, 84.5; middle 

 toe, 18.5-19.5 (19).'' 



Adult female . — Similar to the adult male, but slate color of upper 

 parts darker and browner; culmen partly blackish; length (skin), 164;

examples, with which one from Bogota, Colombia, appears to agree 

 very closely, but one from the Rio Napo, eastern Ecuador, in the 

 United States National Museum collection is so conspicuously different 

 that it can hardly be the same form. The Kio Napo specimen is 

 much browner above than either of the Guatemalan skins or that 

 from Bogota, the spots on the chest are decidedly darker (dull 

 l)lackish) as well as more triangular in form, the malar region is 

 streaked sooty black and pale buffy instead of forming a sharply 

 defined black patch, and the ])lack of the head is much less intense. 

 The wing and tarsus are also shorter.

Young. — A specimen retaining only a portion of the first plumage 

 has the scapulars and a few of the interscapulars marked with broad 

 guttate or fusiform mesial streaks of light russet or dull tawny- 

 ochraceous, and most of the feathers of the chest have a large ovate 

 central spot of buff, margined with olive. 



The series of specimens of this species at my command is much too 

 small to admit of any clear understanding of the extent of individual 

 and geographical variation, especially the latter; but I believe that 

 there are three forms, represented, respectively, by the birds of south- 

 ern Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. Unfortunately I have only 

 one each from the two first-named localities and five from the last. 

 The Mexican (Jalapa) and Guatemalan specimens agree, and differ 

 from all the Costa Rican specimens, in having the bill wholty yellow- 

 ish, the Costa Rican ones having the maxilla black with yellowish 

 tomia; but the Guatemalan specimen, although sexed as a male, is 

 much smaller than the one from Jalapa, has the upper parts much 

 browner (bister or sepia instead of olive) , and the tail almost mummy 

 brown. The Costa Rican specimens are small, like the Guatemalan 

 example, but besides differing in the blackish maxilla, are deep browm- 

 ish olive above (about intermediate m color between the Jalapa and 

 Guatemalan specimens), and have the chest, sides, and flanks mostly 

 gray, instead of olive. Measurements are as follows: 



Collector's notes on fresh colors of the soft parts of the Costa Rican specimens are as 

 follows: "Iris, dark hazel; eyelids, orange; upper mandible, l)lack, broad edges, and 

 lower mandible bright reddish orange; feet, straw"' (feet noted as yellow in one speci- 

 men).

Genus HYLOCICHLA Baird. 



Hylocichla Bairu, Review Am. Birds. June, 1864, 12. (Type, Turdns mustelinus 

 Gmelin.) 



Small, slender-billed, brown, spotted-breasted Turdidae, with wing 

 never more than three and a half times as long as tarsus ; tail not more 

 than three-fourths as long as w^ing and less than three times as long 

 as tarsus ; middle toe (without claw) not more than three-fifths as long 

 as tarsus, and outermost primary usually shorter than primary coverts. 



Bill about half as long as head (or less), slender (stouter in H. 

 mustelina), slightly broader than deep at frontal antiae; exposed 

 culmen decidedly shorter than middle toe without claw, straight 

 basally," gradually and increasingly decurved terminally, the tip 

 more or less distinctly uncinate; gonys faintly convex, ascending 

 terminally, slightly longer than mandibular rami; maxillary tomium 

 faintly convex posteriorly, faintly concave anteriorly, distinctly 

 notched subterminally. Nostril more or- less oval or ovate, narrower 

 anteriorly, posteriorly in contact with frontal feathering, overhung 

 by broad membrane. Rictal bristles distinct; loral feathers mthout 

 distinct (if any) bristle-like tips. Wing rather long and pointed; 

 outermost (tenth) primary very small, shorter than primary coverts 

 and less than one-fourth as long as ninth (except in H. guttata) ; 

 ninth primary longer than fifth (equal, or nearly equal, to seventh in 

 //. alicise .and H. fuscescens), the eighth, or eighth and seventh, 

 longest; eighth, seventh, and sixth with outer webs sinuated (only 

 the eighth and seventh in H. ustulata) ; longest primaries exceeding 

 longest secondaries by length of tarsus, or more. Tail equal to or 

 longer than distance from bend of wing to end of secondaries (except 

 in H. mustelina), even or (in H. ustulata) very faintly emarginate, 

 the rectrices (when not worn) slightly acuminate at extreme tip. 

 Tarsus long and slender, less than one-third as long as wing, less than 

 half as long as tail, the acrotarsium with both sides undivided; middle 

 toe (without claw) three-fifths as long as tarsus or very slightly less; 

 lateral toes unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to subtermi- 

 nal articulation of middle toe, the outer somewhat longer; hallux 

 slightly shorter than inner toe; basal phalanx of middle toe united 

 for more than basal half to outer toe, for less than basal half to inner 

 toe; claws rather small, but well curved and sharp, that of hallux 

 decidedly shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Above plain brown or olive, sometimes more rufescent 

 on pileum or tail; beneath whitish (usually more or less buffy ante- 

 riorly), the chest with triangular spots of brown, dusky, or black; 

 young essentially like adults, but with pileum, back, etc., streaked 

 with whitish, buffy, or pale rusty, longer wing-coverts tipped with 

 the same, and (except in H. mustelina) spots on under part more 

 transverse and extended backward over sides and flanks. 



a Sometimes (especially in H. alidse Ucknelli) the culmen is slightly depressed or 

 concave immediately above the anterior end of nasal fossse. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 35 



Nidification. — Nest open above, more or less bulky, placed in low 

 trees, in bushes, or on or near ground, composed ol shreds of bark, 

 dead leaves, dry grasses, etc., lined with finer shreds of bark, fine 

 rootlets, etc., that of H. mustelina with a plastering of mud between 

 lining and exterior; eggs (2-5) greenish blue, with or without brown 

 spots. 



Range. — Confined to the Nearctic Region" (one species extending 

 its breeding range to eastern Siberia) ; south in winter to Cuba, 

 Mexico, Central America, and South America. (Five species, with 

 additional subspecies.) 



Although usually considered as closely allied to Turdus, the rela- 

 tionships of this group seem to be decidedly with Catharus, an 

 opinion first formed by careful examination of their structure and 

 later confirmed by observation of four species of Catharus in life, the 

 habits and songs of the Cathari (especially C. frantzii and C gracili- 

 rostris) being strikingly similar to those of the HylocicMx. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF HYLOCICHLA. 



a. Bill larger and stouter, the exposed culmen more than half as long as tarsus; tail 

 relatively shorter, less than distance from bend of wing to end of secondaries; out- 

 stretched feet reaching nearly, if not quite, to tip of tail; sides and flanks sjjotted; 

 pileum more rufescent than back. (Eastern temperate North America, south in 

 winter to Cuba, Jamaica, Porto Rico, and Nicaragua.) Hylocichla mustelina (p. 37) 

 aa. Bill smaller and more slender, the exposed culmen less than half as long as tarsus; 

 tail relatively longer, equal to or longer than distance from bend of wing to end 

 of secondaries; outstretched feet falling far short of tip of tail; sides and flanks 

 not spotted; pileum concolor with back. 

 b. Outermost (spurious) primary equal to or longer than primary coverts; ninth 

 primary shorter than sixth; tail and upper tail-coverts distinctly more rufes- 

 cent than color of back. {Hylocichla guttata.) 

 c. Sides and flanks grayish or olivaceous; bill relatively smaller or more slender; 

 tail relatively longer; feet relatively smaller. (Western subspecies.) 

 d. Smaller (wing averaging less than 90). 



e. Wing averaging more than 86 in male, more than 84 in female; coloration 



darker and browner. 



/. Coloration lighter, the back, etc. , more olive, the chest more faintly tinged 



with buff, the sides and flanks more gray. (Breeding in coast district 



of Alaska, from Lynn Canal and north side of Cross Sound to Kadiak 



Island, Alaska peninsula, and Nushagak; in winter south to Lower 



California, Mexico, and Texas.) Hylocichla guttata guttata (p. 39) 



ff. Coloration darker, the back, etc., more sepia or'olive-brown, chest more 

 deeply buffy, sides and flanks more olive. (Breeding in coast district 

 of southern Alaska and British Columbia; south in winter to Cali- 

 fornia and Arizona.) Hylocichla guttata nana (p. 42) 



a The Palsearctic Turdus musicus has been referred to Hylocichla by some authors, 

 a view of its relationship which I at one time shared; but more recent and careful 

 study has convinced me that it is much more nearly related to Turdus (an exclusively 

 Old World type) and perhaps not separable from that genus. Among the characters 

 which clearly exclude it from Hylocichla are the extremely minute spurious primary, 

 relatively longer wing and middle toe and shorter tarsus (wing much more than three 

 and a half times as long as tarsus, and middle toe, without claw, more than three-fifths 

 as long as tarsus) .

HYLOCICHLA GUTTATA SLEVENI (Grinnell). 

 MONTEEY HERMIT THRUSH. 



Similar to H. g. guttata, but paler and grayer, and decidedly smaller. 

 Adult male (average measurements). — Wing, 84; tail, 71.'* 

 Adult females (average measurements). — Wing, 81; tail, 69." 

 "Breeds in the cloudy coast belt of California, from southern Monte- 

 rey County northward, locally, at least, to Sonoma County;"^ during 

 migration southward to Los Angeles County (Pasadena, April) and 

 to Santa Margarita Island, Lower California (February) ; Arizona 

 (Tucson, April 6; Huachuca Mountains, April), and Sonora (Campos, 

 February 3). 



I am unable to give a more satisfactory diagnosis of this form, for 

 the reason that no authentic specimens are available. A female in 

 Mr. Brewster's collection (no. 20167) from Campos, Sonora (February 

 3, 1887) seems to belong to it; at least this specimen, while having the 

 pale dull grayish coloration of H. g. sequoiensis is smaller than any 

 specimen of either H. g. guttata or H. g. nana with which I have been 

 able to compare it, its measurements being as follows: Wing, 82.5; 

 tail, 63; exposed culmen, 13.5; tarsus, 28; middle toe, 15.

HYLOCICHLA USTULATA USTULATA (Nuttall). 

 RUSSET-BACKED THRUSH. 



Adults in spring and summer. — Above plain olive-brown (varying 

 from nearly hair brown to between broccoli brown and raw-umber) ; « 

 a conspicuous orbital ring and loral region pale buff, the latter more 

 or less obscured with olive-brownish, especially near central portion; 

 auricular region olive-brown, with narrow shaft-streaks of pale buff 

 or buffy wliitish; malar region buffy, more or less distinctly streaked 

 or suffused with olive-brownish; chin, tlu-oat, and chest buff (more or 

 less deep), the chin and throat sometimes buffy white, the sides of 

 lower throat and whole chest with triangular marks of deep olive- 

 brown, these markings narrower and more wedge-shaped anteriorly, 

 broader posteriorly, those on middle or central portion of chest 

 darker, sometimes approaching a sooty hue; a submalar streak of 

 olive-brown along each side of tliroat; breast, abdomen, and under 

 tail-coverts white, the upper portion of the first (especially on lateral 

 portions) transversely spotted with light olive-brown; sides and 

 flanks pale olive-brown or broccoli brown; axillars pale olive-brown- 

 ish, narrowly tipped with paler and becoming paler and more buffy 

 basally; under wing-coverts pale buffy, suffused with pale brownish; 

 bill dusky brown or blackish, the basal half (approximately) of man- 

 dible pale (pale dull fleshy or lilaceous in life); iris deep brown; legs 

 and feet pale brownish (in dried skins) . 



Adults in autumn and winter. — Similar to the spring and summer 

 plumage, but more deeply or brightly colored, the brown of upper 

 parts varying from olive-brown to russet-brown,'' buff of anterior 

 under parts deeper, and under tail-coverts tinged with buff. 



Young. — Above olive-brown, the remiges and rectrices as in adults, 

 but pileum, hindneck, back, scapulars, and lesser wing-coverts 

 streaked with buff, rump and upper tail-coverts indistinctly streaked 

 or spotted with pale tawny, the middle and greater wing-coverts 

 tipped (more or less distinctly) with buff or pale tawny; under parts 

 much as in adults, but markings all distinctly transverse, except 

 (sometimes) on extreme upper chest and sides of lower throat, the 

 sides, and flanks (sometimes also lower breast and sides of abdomen) 

 barred or transversely spotted with olive-brown or dusky; under 

 tail-coverts pale grayish buffy. 



Adult male. —hangth (skins), 161-185 (173); wing, 93-103.5 (97.8); 

 tail, 67-79.5 (73); exposed culmen, 13-15 (13.9); tarsus, 27-31 

 (28.2); middle toe, 16-18.5 (17.4).^^ 



o I find, after examination of a very large series of specimens, that the variation in 

 color is not at all geographical, the extremes occurring together, even during the 

 breeding season.

HYLOCICHLA USTULATA SWAINSONII (Cabanis). 

 OLIVE-BACKED THRUSH. 



Similar to H. u. ustulata, but color much grayer or more olivaceous; 

 color of upper parts varying from olive to grayish hair brown in sum- 

 mer, from deep olive to slightly brownish olive in winter; spots on 

 chest averaging broader and darker (sometimes sooty blackish) on a 

 more yellowish buff or creamy buff ground color; sides and flanks 

 olive or grayish olive. 



Adult ma/^.— Length (skins), 158-176 (166); wing, 96.5-105 

 (100.9); tail, 66-77.5 (70.1); exposed culmen, 11.5-14.5 (13); tarsus,

o Thirty-five specimens. 

 b Thirty-two specimens. 

 Specimens from different geographic areas average, respectively, as follows: 



I am not able to discover any constant difference between eastern specimens, on the 

 one hand, and western and Alaskan specimens, on the other. In fact, when specimens 

 of corresponding date are compared the average difference, if any exists at all (there is 

 certainly none in autumnal examples and little, if any, in those taken in spring), is 

 too slight, in my judgment, to warrant the recognition of two geographic forms or sub- 

 species. A considerable series of specimens taken in Alaska in July look grayer than 

 a smaller number taken in the mountains of Pennsylvania in June; but even allowing 

 for the greater abrasion and fading of the former, occasional specimens from the two 

 regions are practically identical.

 BICKNELI'S THRUSH. 



Similar to //. a. alidse, but decidedly smaller, coloration of upper 

 parts averaging browner " (olive-sepia to sepia brown) and bill aver- 

 aging more slender. 



Young much browner above than that of H. a. alicix, and with 

 chest more decidedly buffy. 



Adult male.— l^ength (skins), 151-167 (159); wing, 88.5-98 (92.1);

a With a much larger series of both this form and true E. alidse (twenty adults of 

 the former and more than fifty of the latter) than that examined by Mr. Brewster (see 

 Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, viii, 1883, 16, 17), I find the average difference in coloration 

 to be very decided.

HYLOCICHLA FUSCESCENS FUSCESCENS (Stephens). 

 WILSON'S THRUSH. 



Adults in spring and summer. — Above plain tawny-brown (varying 

 from almost cinnamon-brown to a more isabelline hue), the wings 

 and tail slightly duller brown, especially the former; loral region 

 dull grayish white, the former sometimes slightly suffused with gray- 

 ish in front of eye; eyelids similar, the color not forming a distinct 

 orbital ring; auricular region rather light dull tawny-brown, narrowly 

 streaked with dull brownish white; malar region dull buffy white, 

 becoming decidedly buffy posteriorly, where more or less distinctly 

 streaked with tawny-brown; chin and throat buffy wliite, gradually 

 passing into pale buff or pinkish buff on chest, the latter tinged with 

 brown laterally, the upper chest and sides of lower throat streaked 

 with tawny-brown, the lower chest spotted with a paler and slightly 

 grayer tint of the same ; "• sides and flanks light buffy grayish or pale 

 hair brown, the sides of breast sometimes faintly spotted with a 

 darker shade of the same; rest of under parts white; axillars pale 

 brownish gray, tipped with white; under wing-coverts mixed pale 

 brownish gray and white, usually slightly tinged with pale brownish 

 buff; bill dark horn color (the maxilla sometimes blackish horn color), 

 the basal half (more or less) of mandible pale yellowish (pale grayish 

 flesh color or lilaceous in life?); iris dark brown; legs and feet pale 

 brownish or pale yellowish brown (dull flesh color in life?). 



Adults in autumn and winter. — Similar to the spring and summer 

 plumage and not constantly different, but averaging slightly brighter 

 (more cinnamomeous or tawny) above, and chest and sides of lower 

 throat slightly deeper buff. 



Young. — Above dull cinnamon or tawny-brown, each feather of 

 pileum, hindneck, back, scapulars, and lesser and middle wing- 

 coverts with a mesial streak or spot*^ of yellowish buff or light clay 

 color, the rump and upper tail-coverts with larger but less distinct 

 spots of a deeper or more tawny hue; greater wing-coverts usually 

 with a more or less distinct terminal spot or margin of brownish buff 

 or clay color; under parts white, the chest, sides of lower throat, and 

 sides of breast more or less strongly suffused or tinged with brownish 

 buff or pale tawny, and barred or transversely spotted with dark 

 sooty brown or dusky, most heavily on chest ; a more or less distinct 

 submalar streak of dusky along each side of throat. 



o The streaks are more linear on sides of lower throat, more cuneate on upper chest, 

 the spots on lower chest more or less triangular and transverse (broader than long); 

 in color the streaks are nearly like the color of the back, but sometimes decidedly 

 darker. 



b The markings are smaller and usually narrower on pileum, larger and more spot- 

 like on back.

^ Butler's "Birds of Indiana" (1897, p. 1149) cites me as authority for the alleged 

 breeding of this species in Knox and Gibson counties. This is of course an error, for 

 I never even imagined the possibility of an "AUeghenian" species breeding along the 

 joint boundary line^f the Carolinian and Austroripanan Provinces. Mr. Butler must 

 have misunderstood me or misinterpreted some written or published statement of 

 mine.

Genus ZELEDONIA Ridgway. 



Zekdonia Ridgavay, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xi, sig. 34, Sept. 20, 1889, 537. (Type, 

 Z. coronata Ridgway.) 

 Very small, long-legged, short-tailed, rounded-winged Turdid8e(?) 

 with tail consisting of only ten rectrices and not longer than tarsus 

 and basal phalanx of middle toe (between one-half and tlu-ee-fifths 

 as long as wing, the latter very little more than twice as long as tarsus) , 

 outermost (tenth) primary very minute (shorter than primary coverts) , 

 the ninth two-thirds as long as eighth, and with an orange-rufous 

 crown-patch. 




70 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Bill small and short (about as long as distance from nostril to mid- 

 dle of eye), its depth at frontal antise (where depth and width about 

 equal) more than half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; 

 exposed culmen about ecjual in length to inner toe without claw, 

 straight basally, then gradually decurved to tip ; gonys faintly convex, 

 ascendmg terminally, nearly as long as distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla, much longer than mandibular rami ; maxillary tomium faintly 

 concave, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril very narrow, lon- 

 gitudinally comma-shaped, broadest anteriorly, overhung by a broad, 

 convex, membraneous operculum, its posterior end hidden by the harsh 

 and semi-erect feathering of frontal antiae. Rictal bristles well devel- 

 oped, especially those nearest nostril. Wing short, very concave 

 beneath, much rounded at tip; outermost (tenth) primary minute 

 (shorter than primary coverts), the ninth two-thirds as long as 

 eighth, or longer, about one-fourth as wide as long; eighth primary 

 shorter than first (about ec^ual to secondaries) ; seventh about equal 

 to third; the sixth, fifth, and fourth longest. Tail very short, but 

 little more than half as long as wing, not longer than combined 

 length of tarsus and ba^al phalanx of middle toe, slightly rounded, 

 the rectrices not more than ten,*^ pointed at tip, their webs lax or semi- 

 decomposed. Tarsus very long and slender^ nearly half as long as 

 wing, at least four-fifths as long as tail, the acrotarsium fused on both 

 sides; middle toe (without claw) three-fifths as long as tarsus, or 

 slightly less; lateral toes slightly unequal, the inner (without claw) 

 reaching to subterminal articulation of middle toe, the outer slightlv 

 beyond; hallux ecjual to inner toe, or very slightly longer, much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe adherent for half its length, or 

 very slightly more, to outer toe, for less than half to inner toe ; claws 

 normal, that of hallux shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Pileum orange-rufous, the remainmg upper parts plam 

 olive or olive-green; under parts plain slate color or slate-gray, becom- 

 ing olive or olive-green on flanks and under tail-coverts. Sexes alike. 



Nidifi cation. — (Unknown. ) 



Range. — Sunmiits of high volcanoes of Costa Rica and Panama. 

 (Monotypic.) 



The relationships of this remarkable genus are somewhat doubtfid, 

 but I feel confident it is not far removed from (kitliarus, of which 

 (except in the character of the nostril, which is very difierent) it seems 

 to be an exaggeration. It is certainly an Oscine and not a Tracheo- 

 phone, as at first supposed. ^ 



o Of the two specimens examined one (the type of Z. coronata) has ten rectrices, the 

 other only eight, but possibly the tail may be imperfect in the latter. 



b The syrinx and wing-muscles has been studied by Mr. W. P. Pycraft, who found 

 them typically Oscinine. (See Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, xi, no. Ixxiv, 1900, 12.) 



[Since the above was written another article, by Mr. Pycraft, entitled "On the 

 Systematic Position of Zeledonia coronata, with some Observations on the Position of 

 the Turdidse," has appeared in Ibis, Jan., 1905, 1-24, pis. 1, 2.]

ZELEDONIA CORONATA Ridgway. 

 WREN-THRUSH, 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum with a broad median patch of tawny, 

 the feathers paler and more 3'ellowish basahy, their tips sometimes 

 dusky, sHghtly obscuring the general color; tliis tawny patch mar- 

 gined laterally by a stripe of dull black, gradually disappearing ante- 

 riorly into the dusky slate-gray of forehead and lores but posteriorly 

 rather abruptly defined against the dusky olive of occiput and hind- 

 neck; back, scapulars, wing-coverts, rump, and upper tail-coverts 

 plain dark brownish olive with a slight tinge of olive-green; the 

 remiges and rectrices similar but rather browner; sides of head (includ- 

 ing superciliary and loral regions), chin, and under parts generally, 

 plain slate color, slightly paler on lower abdomen, the Hanks and under 

 tail-coverts plam dark olive, the whole of posterior under parts some- 

 times washed with olive-green; bill blackish, the mandible more 

 brownish, especially basally; iris dark brown; legs and feet brownish 

 black or dusky brown. 



Young. — Similar to adults, but orange-rufous crown-patch much 

 smaller and less sharpl}^ defined, the blackish lateral crown-stripes 

 replaced by very indistinct ones of dusky (these obsolete anteriorly), 

 and sides of head and under parts olive mstead of dull slate color. 

 (No trace of streaks or spots anj^vhere, but feathers of under parts of 

 body with a barel}" perceptible narrow termmal margin of dusky.)

 Delattre, p. 26). (Type, by elimination, Turdus Vherminieri Lafresnaye.) 

 Cichlervnnia (emendation) Sclater, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, 335. 



Large, stoutly-built, short-tailed, long-legged Turdidse with large 

 and stout bill, color uniform brown above, brown with pointed spots 

 of white below. 



Bill large and stout, shorter than head, about as broad as deep at 

 frontal antise; exposed culmen about as long as middle toe without 

 claw, or slightly shorter, rather strongly convex from the nearly 

 straight basal portion, the tip of maxilla distinctly but not strongly 

 uncinate ; gonys straight or very faintly convex, ascending terminally, 

 slightly longer than mandibular rami; maxillar}^ tomium faintly con- 

 cave in middle portion, still more faintly convex subbasally, ver}^ dis- 

 tinctly notched subterminally. Nostril oval or ovate, occupjdng 

 about lower half of exposed portion of nasal fossa^, overhung b}" con- 

 cave mem})rane, posteriorly nearly or c{uite in contact with frontal 

 feathering. Rictal bristles very distinct, those near nostrils especially 

 so ; loral and frontal feathers without bristly points. Orbital region 

 naked, or partly so. Wing rather long and pointed, the longest pri- 

 maries exceeding longest secondaries by length of middle toe (with- 



o The only specimen seen from the Volcan de Irazii is very different in coloration 

 from any other specimen examined, but I am satisfied that the coloration is abnormal, 

 indicating a condition of partial albinism. It bears in Mr. Cherrie's handwriting on 

 the label the name Zeledonia insperata Cherrie and, should other specimens from 

 Irazu prove to be like it in coloration, that name would of course be available for it 

 as representing a distinct form, which I consider altogether unlikely, since the Volcan 

 de Irazii is intermediate in position between the volcanoes of Poas and Chiriqui, 

 the birds of which are, so far as I am able to see, precisely alike in coloration. The 

 Irazii specimen may be described as follows: 



Similar in pattern of coloration to Z. coronata (from the Volcan de Pods and Volcan 

 de Chiriqui), but the dark olive of back, scapulars, etc., replaced by rather light 

 tawny-olive; that of wings and tail by light grayish brown (between broccoli lirown 

 and isabella color); deep slate-color of sides of head and under parts replaced by 

 drab-gray; bill, legs, and feet pale brown instead of blackish. 



The tawny crown-patch is somewhat lighter in tone and broader, but its increased 

 width may be owing to greater spreading apart of the feathers in making up the skin. 

 The broad black lateral crown-stripes of normal Z. coronata are indicated by decidedly 

 narrower stripes of dark sooty grayish.

out claw) or more; outermost (tenth) primary longer than primary 

 coverts (about one-third as long as ninth or slightly more), rounded 

 at tip, ninth primary equal to or longer than fourth; eighth, seventh, 

 and sixth longest and nearly ecpial ; eighth to fifth (inclusive) with 

 outer webs sinuated. Tajl much shorter than distance from bend 

 of wing to end of secondaries, even. Tarsus long and slender, one- 

 third as long as wing, or more, the acrotarsium fused on both 

 sides; middle toe (without claw) three-fifths as long as tarsus, or 

 slightly less ; lateral toes equal, both (without claw) reaching a little 

 beyond subterminal articulation of middle toe; hallux shorter than 

 inner toe; basal phalanx of middle toe adherent for more than half 

 its length to outer toe, for nearly half to inner toe; claws slightly 

 curved, rather blunt, that of the hallux sometimes nearly as long as 

 its digit.

a The single specimen upon which this very distinct species is based is one of the two 



"types" of Turdus Vherminieri Lafresnaye, in the collection of the Boston Society of 

 Natural History. The other specimen is exactly like other Guadeloupe specimens 

 ( C. herminieri) except that, having been for a long time mounted and exposed to the 

 light, is slightly faded. The present one (no. 3618, Lafresnaye collection) is, how- 

 ever, unquestionably a different species, and is the only one of the group having the 

 whole chest maiked with large ovate spots of white, very nearly as large as those on the 

 sides, flanks, and abdomen. As to the locality, there are only two islands besides those 

 inhabited by well-known forms, namely, St. Vincent and Martinique. The forms 

 which formerly inhabited these are probably now extinct. As long ago as 1878 Ober 

 found the Martinique form "rare, owing to the perseciition of hunters," and was unable 

 to obtain a specimen (see Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., i, 1878, 351), nor was he able to obtain, 

 or even see, a specimen of the St. Vincent bird, although he heard its note (Proc. U. S. 

 Nat. Mus., 1, p. 187). Martinique being a French possession, it is more likely that 

 Lafresnaye obtained from there the specimen upon which I have based the new species 

 rather than from the British island of St. Vincent.

BAHAMAN THRUSH. 



Similar to M. rubripes schistacea, but with under tail-coverts and 

 anal region slate-gray, like rest of under parts, and white of chin and 

 malar region more restricted. 



Adult male. — Above plain slate color; wings and tail black, the 

 former with broad bluish slate-gray edgings, almost concealing the 

 black in the closed wing, except on tertials, and terminal portion of 

 primaries, primary coverts, and alula?, where the bluish gray edgings 

 are much narrower; outer webs of four middle rectrices with basal 

 portion partly slate color; inner webs of lateral rectrices extensively 

 white (this more restricted toward middle rectrices), the correspond- 

 ing portion of outer web gray; lores, suborbital region, and whole 



a Having only one specimen for comparison, and that in very much abraded plum- 

 age, I am unable to give the characters of this form with precision. In the specimen 

 examined the white on inner web of the lateral rectrix extends 52 mm. from the tip, 

 the maximum in a large series of the other two forms being about 10 mm. less. A 

 specimen in first plumage is very different from the corresponding stage of the two 

 more northern forms, as pointed out above. 



6 Measurements of an adult male as given liy Dr. J. A. Allen (Auk, viii, 1891, 217), 

 converted into millimeters, are as follows: Length (skiii), 255.5; wing, 116.8; tail, 

 114.3; exposed culmen, 21.6; tarsus, 38.1.

 throat-patch similar but becoming very slightly paler (more slate- 

 gray) posteriorly; bill varying from black to reddish, usually reddish 

 dusky; iris brown; bare orbital ring, legs, and feet bright orange-red

Fraser.) 



Medium-sized to large Turdidse with four primaries (eighth to fifth, 

 inclusive) sinuated on outer webs, gonys equal to or longer than 

 mandibular rami, the width of space between latter at base decidedly 

 less than length of gonys; wing much more than three times (some- 

 times nearly five times) as long as tarsus, and base of remiges (on 

 under side) without any definite light-colored area. (No definite or 

 exclusive color-characters. ) 



Bill decidedly (usually much) shorter than head, compressed, its 

 width at frontal anticT not more (usually less) than its height at same 

 point; exposed cidmen decidedly shorter than middle toe (without 

 claw), straight or nearly so basally (sometimes for basal third or 

 more), then gradually and increasingly decurved terminally, the tip 

 of mandible obviously though somewhat slightly uncinate; gonys 

 longer than mandibular rami, straight or faintly convex, ascending 

 terminally, its base sometimes forming an obvious prominence or 

 angle; maxillary tomium faintly concave near middle, as faintly 

 convex subbasally, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril longi- 

 tucfinally oval, ovate, or elliptical, posteriorly in contact with latero- 

 frontal feathering, margined above by membrane, the latter usually 

 much narrower than the nostril. Rictal and decumbent post-nasal 

 bristles well developed; loral feathers with minute bristle-like points. 

 Wing variable as to relative length and proportionate development of 

 primaries, but usually rather long and pointed, the longest primaries 

 exceeding longest secondaries by at least the length of exposed cul- 

 men, sometimes by more than length of tarsus; outermost (tenth) 

 primary variable as to relative size and form, sometimes shorter than 

 primary coverts, sometimes very much longer, but never more than 

 half as long as ninth,'* usually rather narrow and more or less pointed,

b In P. gigas (type of Semimerula Sclater) and the allied P. gigantodes the tenth 

 primary is half as long as the ninth and very broad. In most species of true Planesticus 

 it is less than one-fourth as long and relatively narrow; but in P.fuscatra, P. cacozela, 

 P. fulviventris, and P. jamaicensis it is more than one-third as long, the difference in 

 the development of this quill-feather between the two species last mentioned and the 

 two first named being decidedly less than between the former and that species having 

 the smallest spurious primary (P. vngratorius) , in which it is only about one-fifth as 

 long as the ninth. In short, scarcely two species agree in the relative size and exact

but sometimes relatively broad and rounded at the tip;" ninth 

 primary sometimes shorter than third (P. fulviventris) , sometimes 

 longer than fifth; eighth, seventh, and sixth, eighth and seventh, 

 seventh and sixth, or sixth primaries longest; four primaries (eighth 

 to fifth, inclusive) with outer web sinuated. Tail shorter than wing 

 but usually longer than distance from bend of wing to end of second- 

 aries (very slightly shorter than the latter only in P. jamaicensis, 

 P. fhsRopygus, and P. fumigatus), even, or slightly rounded, the 

 rectrices rather broad. Tarsus slightly more than one-fifth to more 

 than one-third as long as w4ng (the variation depending more, how- 

 ever, on relative length of the wing, which differs much more than that 

 of the tarsus), the acrotarsium completely fused on both sides; middle 

 toe (without claw) usually about two-thirds as long as tarsus or 

 slightly more (distinctly less than two-thirds only in P. jamaicensis, 

 nearly three-fourths as long in P. merula) ; lateral toes unequal, the 

 inner (without claw) reaching to subterminal articulation of middle 

 toe, the outer slightly beyond; hallux slightly shorter than inner toe; 

 basal phalanx of middle toe united for more than basal half to outer 

 toe (for its entire length, or very nearly so in P. fumigatus!), for less 

 than half to inner toe; claws variable in relative length and curvature, 

 more slender and less strongly curved, that of hallux relatively longer 

 (but shorter than its digit) in P. merula and P. migratorius, shorter 

 and more strongly curved in other species. 



Coloration. — Coloration extremely variable, the various American 

 species (together with several Old World congeners) being classifiable 

 according to this character into the following groups: •♦ 



A. — Sexes very different, the female conspicuously duller in color than the male. 



a. Adult males entirely black, females grayish brown.

shape of the tenth primary. It is true that all of the American forms, at least, except 

 those named above (also P. merula and the African P. olivacea) come within the gap 

 between P. migratorius on the one hand and P. jamaicensis on the other; but neverthe- 

 less P. gigas and P. gigantodes are so evidently nearly related to P. nigrescens and other 

 species with "normal " tenth primary that I do not feel justified in recognizing a genus 

 (Semimerula) Ijased on this character alone. 



o A pointed tip is not, however, always correlated with the narrower form, a rela- 

 tively broad one sometimes having a pointed tip, and vice versa.

That these color-diflferences are of only secondary value in classifi- 

 cajtion, so far as this group is concerned, is shown by the fact that 

 very often the species most similar in color show the greatest struc- 

 tural differences, for example: P. jamaicensis compared with P. tristis, 

 P. iiihseopygus, and allies; P. nigrescens compared with P. gigas and 

 related forms; and P. gymno'pMhalmus compared with P. alhiventris, 

 P. leucomelas, etc. 



Of all the American species none approach very closely in certain 

 characters, especially the exceedingly compressed bill, long gonys 

 (nearly twice as long as mandibular rami), and arched mesorhinium, 

 to P. merula, and I am not at all certain that they are really congeneric. 

 Probably a more thorough study of the group than I am at present 

 able to give it would develop characters justifying the separation of 

 all the American forms, together with at least some of the African 

 ones, from P. merula and most of the other Old World forms, either 

 as a single generic group or several. P. fumigatus almost certainly 

 should be separated on account of the much greater adhesion of the 

 anterior toes, no other thrush that I have been able to examine hav- 

 ing practically the entire length of the basal phalanx of the middle 

 toe united to the outer toe.

a One specimen, from Costa Rica. 



These compare in average measurements with Guatemalan specimens (not sexed) 

 as follows: 



b Owing to lack of a sufficient number of specimens with exact locality recorded 

 I am not able to define very exactly the respectives ranges of this form and P. t. 

 cnephosa. In a series of seven specimens fx'om Santa Maria, Costa Rica, there are 

 five P. t. leucauchen and two P. t. cnephosa. Santa Maria is on the western border of 

 the central plateau, near the head of a stream which flows into the Pacific. It is, 

 therefore, possible that the mingling of tlie two forms in the locality mentioned re- 

 sults from the intrusion along the valley of this stream by P. t. cnephosa from the west- 

 ward. 



c Examination of specimens from other localities cited would of course be necessary 

 to enable one to determine which form is represented in each.

The series examined is very deficient in specimens from the mainland, so that I am 

 unaltle to determine satisfactorily whether the island birds are really identical or not. 

 The single Cayenne example is decidedly browner than any of the others.

 toe (with claw), straight basally, then gradually but not strongly 

 decurved toward tip; gonys much longer than mandibular rami 

 (nearly etpial to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla), straight or 

 very faintly convex, gradually ascending terminally; maxillary to- 

 mium nearly straight (but appreciably concave at or anterior to iniddle 



a This diagnosis covers a group of Palaearctic Turdidae, including many species 

 besides the type (T. viseivorus), some of which, while exceedingly similar to certain 

 Planestici in other characters, including even coloration, nevertheless differ from all 

 the latter in every one of the characters mentioned with the exception of the minute 

 spurious primary, which, however, is so nearly diagnostic in the strictest sense that 

 only one Planesticus (P. migratorius) among all those examined agrees with Turdus in 

 that respect. 



The detailed description of generic characters is, however, drawn up from T. visei- 

 vorus, T. iliacus, and T. musicus alone. It is almost certain that the group in its larger 

 sense should be subdivided, but as the present work is directly concerned with only a 

 single species ( T. iliacus), which occurs in America merely as a straggler to Greenland, 

 I shall not go further into the subject.

 tively small, horizontally oval, ovate, or fusiform, overhung by mem- 

 brane, posteriorly in contact with frontal feathering. Rictal and 

 decumbent post-nasal bristles well developed; loral feathers, also 

 those of chin, with distinct bristle-like points (more minute in T. musi- 

 cus). Wing long and pointed, the longest primaries exceeding longest 

 secondaries by more than length of tarsus (by combined length of tar- 

 sus and middle toe, without claw, in T. viscivorus); outermost (tenth) 

 ])rimary minute, narrow, more or less acuminate (less so in T. visci-

 tarsus, nearly even (T. viscivorus) , slightly emarginate {T. iliacus) or 

 slightly double-rounded {T. musicus). Tarsus relatively short and 

 rather stout (longer and more slender in T. musicus), nearly one-third

 middle toe (without claw) two-thirds as long as tarsus (T. musicus) 

 or decidedly more ( T. iliacus and T. viscivorus) ; lateral toes slightly 

 unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to subterminal articulation 

 of middle toe, the outer slightly beyond (outer toe shorter, barely 

 exceeding the inner, in T. musicus); hallux slightly shorter than 

 inner toe ; basal phalanx of middle toe united for basal half or more to 

 outer toe, for much less than half to inner toe ; claws normal (rather 

 short and blunt in T. viscivorus), that of hallux decidedly shorter 

 than its digit. 



Coloration- -Above plain brown or gray (the longer wing-coverts 

 and secondaries with paler edgings in T. viscivorus); no white on tail; 

 under parts whitish spotted or streaked with dusky; axillars and 

 under wing-coverts plain white, bufl', or ruf ous-ciim.amon ; no light- 

 colored area or "pattern" at base of inner webs of remiges. 



Nidification. — Nest bulky, open above, usually placed in small trees 

 or bushes, sometimes on the ground, composed exteriorly of fine twigs, 

 dry grasses, dead leaves, moss, etc., the inside plastered with mud, 

 this lined with fine dry grass stems, fine rootlets, bits of decayed wood, 

 etc. ; eggs greenish blue (more or less deep) or whitish (rarely reddish), 

 speckled or otherwise marked with brown or blackish.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 129 



Genus IXOREUS Bonaparte.a 



Ixoreus Bonaparte, Comptes Rendus, xxxviii, 3, iiute, Jan., 1854; Orn. Coll. 

 Delattre, 1854, 26, footnote. (Type, Turdus nsevius Gmelin.) (See Rich- 

 mond, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xv, 1902, 85.) 



Hesperocichla Baird, Review Am. Birds, June, 18G4, 12. (Type, Turdus nxvius 

 Gmelin.) 



Medium-sized Tiirdidas without distinct (if any) subterniinal notch 

 to maxillary tomium, nasal fossa? mostly occupied by dense feather- 

 ing of frontal antise (almost concealing nostril), broad whitish sub- 

 basal band across inner webs of remiges, tawny superciliary stripe, 

 and large tawny or ochraceous spots on greater and middle wing- 

 coyerts. 



Bill much shorter than head, rather slender, decidedly compressed, 

 nnich deeper than wide at frontal antise; exposed culmen much 

 shorter than middle toe (without claw), straight basally, yery grad- 

 ually and not strongly decuryed terminally; gonys much longer than 

 mandibular rami (yery nearly equal to distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla), straight or yery nearly so, its base somewhat prominent; 

 maxillary tomium slightly concaye, especially subterminally, where 

 \yithout distinct, if any, notch. Nostril small, longitudinally oyoid, 

 mostly coyered by the short dense feathering of latero-frontal antise, 

 oyerhung by rather broad membrane. Rictal and decumbent post- 

 nasal bristles well dey eloped though slender and weak; feathers of 

 lores and chin wdth fine bristle-like tips. Wing rather long and 

 pointed, the longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries by com- 

 bined length of tarsus and about half the middle toe; outermost 

 (tenth) primary shorter than primary coyerts, about one-fourth as 

 long as ninth, the latter equal to or longer than sixth, the eighth and 

 seyenth equal and longest; three primaries (eighth, seyenth, and 

 sixth) with outer web sinuated. Tail much less than three times as 

 long as tarsus, slightly longer than distance from bend of wing to end 

 of secondaries, eyen. Tarsus more than one-fourth as long as wing, 

 much less than one-third as long as tail, the acrotarsium fused on 

 both sides (except lower portion); middle toe (without claw) two- 

 thirds as long as tarsus; lateral toes equal, both reaching (without 

 claw) to slightly but decidedly beyond subterminal articulation of 



a It is with extreme reluctance, and only after having given the matter most careful 

 consideration, that I am able to concur in the adoption of Ixoreus Bonaparte for this 

 genus. If we are to go entirely by the original printed record in such cases, ignoring 

 all extraneous evidence, however clear and unimpeachable, as I believe is the only 

 practical)le method of attaining final stability of nomenclature, it really makes no 

 difference whether Bonaparte wrongly identified a Tyi-annine bird { Myiotheretes 

 rufiventris) as Turdus nsevius Gmelin so long as he plainly stated that the typ(> of his 

 new genus Ixoreus is the latter. (See Richmond, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xv, 1902, 85, 

 and Sclater, Ibis, 1903, 142.)

middle toe; hallux slightly shorter than lateral toes; basal ])lialanx 

 of middle toe adherent for slightly more than half its length to outer 

 toe, for very little less to inner toe; claws normal, though rather 

 slightly curved and blunt, that of the hallux much shorter than its 

 digit. 



Coloration. — Above slate color varied by a superciliary stripe and 

 spots on wing-coverts of ochraceous or tawny; under parts largely 

 ochraceous or tawny, the chest crossed by a band of black or dark 

 slate color; adult female much duller in color, with band on chest 

 obsolete (or brownish instead of black or slaty) and upper parts 

 brownish; 3"oung essentially like adult female but chest and breast 

 barred or squamated with grayish brown (no distinct streaks on 

 upper parts). 



Nidificaiion. — Nest placed in trees or bushes, bulky, open above, 

 composed externally of dry grass-stems, mosses, and lichens, slender 

 twigs, etc., lined with finer materials of similar character; eggs pale 

 greenish blue, rather sparingly speckled or spotted with brown. 



Range. — Northwestern North America. (Monotypic.) 



This very distinct genus is most nearly related to CicMoselys Bona- 

 parte "■ of northeastern Asia but is quite distinct, the latter having 

 the bill distinctly notched, the nostrils wholly" exposed, the middle 

 toe (without claw) nearly three-fourths as long as the tarsus, wing 

 and tail relatively longer (the former four times, the latter slightly 

 more than three times, as long as tarsus), and the ninth primary 

 equal to or longer than the seventh, instead of much shorter. The 

 two genera agree in the distinct '^pattern" or broad whitish band 

 across inner webs of remiges, the possession of a conspicuous super- 

 ciliary stripe^ (though this is indistinct in the female of CicMoselys) 

 and marked difference of coloration between the sexes; but while 

 the sexual difference of coloration in Ixoreus is manily one of degree 

 that in CicMoselys is distinctly one of kind, there being few other 

 members of the Turdidse in which the coloration of the sexes is so 

 radically different.^

 Mus., XV, 1892, 317, footnote. 



b This, however, is pure white in Cichlosclys in which the general eoloration is plain 

 blackish slate, approaching black on the head. (The female is plain olive-brown 

 above, beneath transversely spotted with olive-brown on a white and buffy ground.) 



cThe only case that I am, withoul lurthcr examination of specimens, able to recall 

 irf that of Grandala cxlicolor, in which the sexual difference in coloration i.s extreme. 




BIKDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMEliiOA. 131 



IXOREUS NiEVIUS (Gmelin). 

 VARIED THRUSH. 



Adult male in spring and summer. — Above iilaiii slate color, the 

 feathers, especially those of pileum and back, sometimes (in certain 

 lights) slightly darker centrally or mesially; wings (except lesser 

 coverts) dusky, with slate or slate-gray edgings, the middle coverts 

 with a large terminal spot (usually more or less triangular or guttate 

 in form) of tawny, tawny-ochraceous, ochraceous, or ochraceous- 

 buff, the greater coverts also broadly tipped with the same (mostly 

 on outer web), the secondaries edged subterminally with a paler and 

 duller tint of the same, the primaries (except two or three outermost) 

 ochraceous-buff or cinnamon-butf on basal portion of outer web and 

 edged with the same at point of sub terminal sinuation, the outer 

 web of secondaries also ochraceous-buff or tawny-ochraceous basally 

 (concealed by greater coverts), the tertials often tipped with pale 

 ochraceous, buffy, or whitish; two or three outermost rectrices with 

 a white or whitish spot at tip of inner web (largest on the lateral rec- 

 trix) ; a conspicuous supra-auricular stripe of tawny-ochraceous or 

 ochraceous-buff, extending from middle of upper eyelid (sometimes 

 from above lores) to nape; loral, suborbital, and auricular regions 

 uniform black, slate-black, or blackish slate; malar region, cliin, 

 throat, and breast uniform tawny, tawny-ochraceous, ochraceous, or 

 ochraceous-buff, the chest crossed by a more or less broad (rarely 

 interrupted) band of black, slate-black, or blackish slate, the feathers 

 sometimes margined with a more slaty hue; sides and flanks similar 

 in color to breast but paler, the feathers broadly margined with oliva- 

 ceous slate-gray; abdomen, more or less extensively,'^ white; under 

 tail-coverts brownish slate-gray basally, extensively wliite terminally, 

 the white usually more or less strongly suffused wath tawny or ochra- 

 ceous; axillars and under wing-coverts wliite basally, broadly slate- 

 gray terminally; inner webs of remiges crossed by a broad basal or 

 sub-basal band of white or pale buffy; bill brownish black or dusky 

 brown, the basal portion of mandible pale colored; iris brown; legs 

 and feet pale yellowish brown (in dried skins). 



Adult male in autumn and urinter. — Similar to the spring and sum- 

 mer plumage, but usually with feathers of upper parts (especially on 

 pileum and back') indistinctly margined with olive, and coloration in 

 general averaging slightly deeper (especially when compared with late 

 spring or midsummer specimens) . 



Adult female. — Much duller in coloration than the adult male. 

 Upper parts varying from olivaceous slate-gray (nearly mouse gray) 



o The white may be restricted to the extreme lower central portion of the abdomen 

 (in very highly colored specimen.s) or may invade the breast and inner portion of the 

 sides, the variation in the relative extent of the white and tawny on the under parts 

 being considerable.

BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



to brownish olive (still browner on pileiim), the markings on wings 

 and tail as in the male; tawny color of nnder parts paler (varying 

 from rather pale ochraceous-buff to ochraceous), the band across 

 chest more or less indistinct and never (?) uniform blackish or slate 

 color — usually with feathers dusky centrally (more or less concealed) 

 margined with dull ochraceous or buffy grayish; " white of posterior 

 under parts usually (?) relatively more extended than in male. 



Young. — Much like adult female, but under parts more yellowish 

 ochraceous, with feathers of breast and lower throat narrowly mar- 

 gined or tipped with olive or dusky (these markings sometimes indis- 

 tinct), the jugular band sometimes uniform dull olive, oftener with 

 feathers ochraceous centrally broadly margined with olive or dusky.'' 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 214-241 (226); wing, 119-132.5 

 (126.7); tail, 78.5-93.5 (87.4); exposed culinen, 18-23 (20.7); tarsus, 

 29.5-32.5 (31.4); middle toe, 21-23 (22. 1).*^ 



Adult female.—Len^th (skins), 200-242 (224); wing, 119-130.5 

 (124.6); tail, 83.5-90 (87.1); exposed culmen, 19-23 (21.4); tarsus, 

 30-33 (31.7); middle toe, 20-23.5 (22).^' 



a Sometimes the band is nearly, rarely quite, obsolete. 



b Owing to doubt as to the correct sexing of two specimens, I am not sure whether the 

 sexes differ or not in first plumage. Were it not for these two specimens the 

 remainder of the series examined (seven specimens) would indicate (so far as the speci- 

 mens have sex determined) a decided sexual difference, the males having nearly the 

 whole of the lower parts ochraceous and the jugular l)an(l indistinct, the females having 

 the posterior half of the lower parts mostly white, and the jugular band more or less 

 conspicuous. 



c Twenty specimens. 



rf Seventeen sijecimcns. 



Specimens from the Pacific coast slope and interior districts compare in average 

 measurements as follows: 



With a series of one hundred and forty specimens (sixty-seven adult males from the 

 coast district and seven from the interior, forty-two adult females from coast and four- 

 teen from interior localities, besides nine young representing both districts) I have 

 been unable, after very careful comparison, to discover the slightest reason for recog- 

 nizing two forms of this species. The color-characters upon which Mr. Grinnell's 

 separation (Auk, xviii, 1901, 142-145) is based appear to be mainly if not wholly of an 

 individual nature, and occur in different specimens from whatsoever locality they 

 may have been taken.

Genvxs RIDGWAYIA Stejneger. 



Ridgwayia Stejneger, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., v, Feb. 13, 1883, 460. (Type, 

 Turdus pinicola Sclater.) 



Medium-sized Turdidas (length about 200-230 mm.) with wing 

 more than five times as long as tarsus, the latter shorter than middle 

 toe with claw, and inner webs of remiges marked by a very broad 

 basal band of white. 



Bill much shorter than head, rather stout, its height at frontal 

 antise equal to half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla and 

 quite equal to its width at same point; exposed culmen about equal 

 to outer toe with claw, straight basally, then gradually and rather 

 strongly decurved to the tip; gonys equal in length to mandibular 

 rami, straight, ascending terminally; maxillary tomium nearly 

 straight or faintly concave at or anterior to middle, distinctly notched 

 subterminally. Nostril broadly oval, posteriorly in contact with 

 latero-frontal feathering, margined above by narrow membrane. 

 Rictal and decumbent post-nasal bristles well-developed; feathers' 

 of lores and chin with small bristle-like points. Wing long and 

 pointed, the longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries by com- 

 bined length of tarsus and middle toe (without claw) ; outermost 

 (tenth) primary much shorter than primary coverts, less than one- 

 fourth as long as ninth, the latter nearly equal to (sometimes longer 

 than) sixth, the eighth and seventh ecpial and longest; three prima- 

 ries (eighth, seventh, and sixth), with outer web sinuated. Tail a 

 little less than two-tliirds as long as wing (about equal to distance 

 from bend to end of secondaries), slightly double-rounded. Tarsus 

 short and stout, less than one-fifth as long as wing, less than one- 

 third as long as tail, the acrotarsium fused on both sides; middle toe 

 (without claw) more than three-fourths as long as tarsus; lateral toes 

 decidedly unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to or very 

 slightly beyond sul)terminal articulation of middle toe, the outer 

 slightly farther; hallux slightly shorter than inner toe but much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe adherent for rather more than 

 half its length to outer toe, for nearly half to inner toe; claws normal, 

 that of the hallux much shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — General color brown, this more or less streaked with 

 paler; wings and tail black, much varied with white; under parts of 

 body white; sexes decidedly different, the male having the whole 

 throat and chest deep sooty brown, the female with throat mostly 

 whitish, the chest light graA^sh brow^n narrowly streaked ^yith. 

 wdiitish, the pileum and middle line of back streaked with pale 

 brow^nish. Young very different from adults, the pileum, back, etc., 

 sooty blackish conspicuously streaked with buff, the under ])arts buff' 

 conspicuously streaked and squamated with l)lack, especially on 

 chest.

Nidification. — (Unknown. ) 



Range. — Highlands of Mexico (alpine). (Monotypic.) 

 This exceedingly distinct genus, although formerly associated with 

 Turdus, is not at all nearly related to the latter, but is even farther 

 removed than Ixoreus and Cicliloselys; but although its very short 

 tarsi suggest relationship to Sialia, I do not think it is so nearly related 

 to the latter as to the two monotypic genera above mentioned, with 

 wliich it agrees in the conspicuous "pattern" on under side of the 

 reimges and other characters not shared by Sialia. 



RIDGWAYIA PINICOLA (Sclater). 

 AZTEC" THRUSH. 



Adult male. — General color of upper parts dark sooty brown 

 (between sepia and clove brown), the feathers of pileum, hindnebk, and 

 back, together with scapulars and smaller wing-coverts, with very 

 narrow shaft-streaks of very pale brown or 'brownish white, those of 

 the pileum, hindneck, and extreme upper back further varied by hav- 

 ing the inner webs (in part at least) darker, their outer webs paler than 

 the general color; longer and exterior upper tail-coverts white; tail 

 l)lack, the middle pair of rectrices tipped (more or less extensively) 

 with pale gray, this passing into white at extreme tip;'' remaining 

 rectrices more broadly tipped with white (or pale gray passing into 

 white terminally), the white more extensive on inner than on outer 

 web and increasing in extent toward the exterior rectrix, the outer 

 web of which is edged with white; outer webs of greater wing-coverts 

 mostly pale brownish buffy or dullbuffy white, the extreme basaL 

 portion (hidden by middle coverts) and terminal portion dusky 

 brown; secondaries (except two innermost) black, broadly tipped 

 with pale silvery gray, their outer webs edged w4th white, but tliis 

 wliite edging interrupted toward the gray tip; primaries black, 

 broadly tipped with pale silvery gray, extensively white basally (on 

 ])oth webs), the three longest with a white mark at sinuated portion of 

 outer web; alula uniform brownish black; primary coverts black, 

 very broadly tipped with silvery gray, the shafts black in the gray 

 portion; an indistinct superciliary stripe of pale brown; sides of head, 

 chin, throat, and chest deep sooty brown or sepia, the feathers with 

 narrow paler shaft-streaks and sometimes more or less paler at tip; 

 rest of under parts white, more or less tinged with buff, especially on 

 under tail-coverts: a sooty patch on flanks, the breast and sides 

 sometimes mottled or clouded with pale sooty; axillars and under 

 wing-coverts white; bill dusky bniwn; iris brown?; legs and feet 

 brownish or dull yellowish (in dried skins), the toes usually slightly 



" The specific term would suggest Pine Thrush as an appropriate vernacular name; 

 but Mr. Nelson informs me the species does not inhabit the pine belt. 

 b In some specimens the middle pair are black almost to the extremity.

Adult female. — Wings and tail as in adult male, but gray tips to 

 remiges less extensive and much duller gray; brown of upper parts 

 lighter (the scapulars, smaller wdng-coverts, and rump rather light sepia 

 or dark broccoli brown) ; pale streaks of pileum, hindneck, and inter- 

 scapulars nuich broader and more conspicuous, the superciliary stripe 

 also more conspicuous (pale grayish buff or very pale wood brown) ; 

 chin and upper throat pale dull huffy, usually more or less streaked 

 with gra3'ish brown: lower throat, chest, and sides of head and neck

Young male. — Very dift'erent from adults of either sex. General 

 color of upper parts sooty black, the pileum, hindneck, back, scapu- 

 lars, and smaller wing-coverts sharply and conspicuously streaked 

 with buft'y,'' the streaks broadest on back and scapulars and lateral 

 portion of the ])ileum, those on the latter forming a rather conspic- 

 uous though broken superciliarj^ stripe; rump and shorter (central) 

 upper tail-coverts streaked (usually broadly) with cinnamon-rufous; 

 longer and lateral u})per tail-coverts white, more or less tinged with 

 buff, their inner webs partly blackish; greater wing-coverts tipj^ed 

 with a large wedge-shaped spot of buft' or ochraceous-buff, their outer 

 webs narrowly edged with paler buff; remiges and rectrices as in the 

 adult female, but the large whitish spots at tips of innermost seconda- 

 ries tinged with buff, and white tips to rectrices less sharply defined; 

 a broad blackish postocular stripe; lower portion of auricular region, 

 suborbital and malar regions, and under parts buft', becoming whitish 

 on center of abdomen, the feathers margined with black or dark sooty, 

 these blackish margins broadest on chest, where they ])roduce a con- 

 spicuously sc[uamate effect. 



Young female. — Similar to the young male, but streaks on pileum, 

 back, etc., broader, more whitish, the general color above more sooty 

 brown; cinnamon-rufous streaks on rump and middle upper tail- 

 coverts narrower; otherwise, scarcely if at all dift"erent.

(To replace Sialin; on grounds of purism?) 



Small Tiirdida:' (length about 150-175 mm.) with long, pomted 

 wings, small bill, short tarsi, and with more or less blue in the plumage. 



Bill less than half as long as head, rather slender, compressed termi- 

 nally but broad at base, its width at frontal antiw slightly to deci- 

 dedly more than its height at same point; exposed culmen shorter 

 than outer toe with claw, straight or nearly so for about basal half (or 

 else faintly depressed or concave just anterior to nasal fossae),' 

 decurved terminally; gonys longer than mandibular rami, straight 

 or very faintly convex, ascending terminally; maxillary tomium 

 faintly concave subterminally, distinctly notched near tip of maxilla. 

 Nostril l)roadly ovoid, largely covered by short, semierect feathering 

 of frontal antiae, overhung by rather broad membrane. Rictal and 

 decumbent post-nasal bristles well developed; feathers of lores and 

 chin with small l)ristle-like points. Wing long and pointed, the 

 longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries by more than half 

 as much again as length of tarsus, sometimes more than combined 

 length of tarsus and middle toe with claw ; outermost (tenth) primary 

 very small, much shorter than primary coverts, not more (some- 

 times much less) than one-fifth as long as ninth, the latter longer 

 than sixth, sometimes (in S. mexicana and S. arctica) longest (eighth 

 and seventh longest in S. sialis) ; three primaries (eighth, seventh, 

 and sixth) with outer web sinuated. Tail much shorter than wing, 

 equal to distance from bend to end of secondaries (^S*. mexicana and 

 S. arctica) or slight shorter {S. sialis), more than three (sometimes 



a'EKvpoi, gypsum, stucco;' opvt<;, bird. (Richmcmd.) 




BIRDS OF KORTH AXD MIDDLE AMERICA. 139 



nearly three-and-a-half) times as long as tarsus, distinctly (some- 

 times rather deeph^) emarginate. Tarsus short, one-sixth to a little 

 more than one-fifth as long as wing, the acrotarsium fused; middle 

 toe (without claw) three-fourths as long as tarsus, or a little more; 

 lateral toes unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to subter- 

 minal articulation of middle toe, the outer sliglitly beyond; hallux 

 equal to inner toe or very slighth: shorter ; basal phalanx of middle 

 toe adherent for about half its length to outer toe, much less to 

 inner toe; claws moderate in size, rather strongh' curved, acute, 

 that of the hallux much shorter than its digit. 



Coloration. — Adult males rich blue (varj^ing from greenish to 

 purplish, with or without cliestnut on back; under parts light green- 

 ish blue with white al^domen and under tail-coverts, chestnut or 

 cinnamon with white abdomen and under tail-coverts, or blue with 

 cliestnut on breast; adult females much duller than males, grayish 

 or grayish l)rown largely replacing the blue, except on remiges and 

 rectrices; young conspicuously streaked above with pale huffy or 

 whitish, the breast, etc., whitish, squamated with grayish, brownish, 

 or dusky. 



Nidifi cation. — Nest in cavities of trees, stumps, or rocks, or about 

 houses, composed of dried grass-stems, etc., open above; eggs (4 to 7) 

 immaculate pale greenish blue (very rarely white). 



Range. — Temperate North America and highlands of Mexico, 

 Guatemala, and Honduras. (Three species.) 



This beautiful genus of Turdidge is most nearl}^ related to the 

 Himalayan genus Grandala Hodgson. Mr. Seebohm, indeed, con- 

 sidered" the two as congeneric; but on comparison I find them 

 exceedingly distinct, Grandala having the wing excessiveh' long, 

 almost Hirundine, the longest primaries exceeding the secondaries 

 by nearl}" half (more than two-fifths) the total length of the wing, 

 the tarsus and toes relatively longer, the bill much more slender, 

 the gon3's scarcely, if at all, longer than the mandibular rami, the 

 narrowly fusiform or elliptical nostril wholly exposed, no bristle-like 

 points to feathers of frontal antife, and the rictal and decumbent 

 post-nasal bristles much weaker. The adult male of Grandala is rich 

 dark purplish blue, with black wings and tail, thus only distantly 

 resembling the males of the species of Sialia: but the female is con- 

 spicuoush^ streaked, and has a Gocichline " wing-pattern," and there- 

 fore very different from tliose of the latter genus, thougli somewhat 

 resembling the young.

 BLUEBIRD. 



Adult male in spring and summer.— Vpper parts uniform bright blue, 

 varying in hue from sevres bhie" to smalt blue, the average hue 

 being between ultramarine and smalt, the shafts of remiges and rec- 

 trices black, and tips of remiges (especially primaries) dusky; sides of 

 head, including malar region (sometimes including also chin and sides 

 of upper throat) lighter and grayer blue; throat, chest, breast, sides, 

 and flanks, uniform didl cinnamon-rufous or cinnamon-chestnut; 

 abdomen, aiial region, and under tail-coverts, white, the last with 

 longer feathers tinged with pale grayish blue, the shorter (basal) ones 

 with pale cinnamon-rufous; axillars and under wing-coverts pale 

 grayish blue ; bill, legs, and feet, black ; iris, dark brown. 



Adult male in autumn and vmiter. — Similar to the spring and sum- 

 mer plumage, but blue of upper parts slightly duller, more or less 

 obscured on hirdiieck, back, and scapulars, by brownish tips to the 

 feathers, and cinnamon-rufous of chest, etc., more purplish or vina- 

 ceous in hue.

 blue, the tertials and innermost greater coverts more or less distinctly 

 edged with pale brownish gray or whitish, the outermost primary 

 edged with white ; anterior and lateral under parts dull rufous-cinna-

 plumage), the chin and upper throat paler; abdomen, anal region, 

 and under tail-coverts white. 



Young male. — Pileum, hindneck, back, scapulars, rump, and lesser 

 and middle wing-coverts sooty grayish brown or brownish slate tinged 

 with sooty, the back and scapulars (sometimes rump also, but less 

 distinctly) streaked with whitish; middle wing-coverts with a small 

 terminal spot of whitish; greater wing-coverts, primaries, and rectrices 

 bright l)lue (as in the adult male) but tertials broadl}^ edged with 

 brown and margined terminally with pale gray or grayish white; 

 under parts white, the feathers of chest and sides edged or margined 

 with brown (most heavily on chest), producing a conspicuous 

 streaked or scpiamate appearance; a whitish orbital ring. 



Young female. — Similar to the young male, but blue of wings and 

 tail much duller, and dusky streaking or squamation of under parts 

 heavier and more extended.

I am unable to verify, from examination of a much larger series of specimens than 

 that indicated above, alleged color differences in Florida and Bermuda examples. 

 Florida specimens have, as a rule, larger bills than others, the difference being some- 

 times conspicuous; but even were this character constant I should not be inclined to 

 consider the Florida birds as different enough to constitute a satisfactory subspecies.

SIALIA MEXICANA ANABEL.ffi Anthony. 

 SAN PEDRO BLUEBIRD. 



Similar to S. m. mexicana, but with bill larger and stouter; blue of 

 upper parts averaging less violaceous (more ultramarine), back more 

 often mixed with chestnut laterally;'' adult female with back and 

 scapulars grayish brown, forming a definite dorsal patch, distinctly 

 defined against the brownish gray or dull grayish blue of pileum and 

 hindneck, and, with the grayish brown or brownish gray of throat, 

 breast, etc., paler than in S. m. mexicana. 



« Ten specimens. 



& Eight specimens. 



c A series of forty-three adult males from the San Pedro Martir Mountains exhibits 

 the following variation in coloration of the back and under parts: 



With no chestnut whatever on back or scapulars 21 



With the back chiefly blue 18 



With the back about equally blue and chestnut 4 



With the chestnut of the breast divided 30 



With the chestnut of the breast continuous anteriorly 11

t> Two specimens, the wing and tail measurements representing extremes and aver-

c California specimens are not typical of this form, but are much nearer to it 

 than ioS. m. occidentalis, from which they differ in larger size, more restricted areas of 

 chestnut (though this character varies greatly in both forms), and, on the average, 

 decidedly richer or more violaceous hue of the blue. Twelve adult males, taken 

 during the breeding season, in the Laguna Mountains, San Diego County, and one from 

 Nachoguero Valley, Lower California (near the boundary line), all have more or 

 less of chestnut on the back and that of the under parts extends uninterruptedly 

 across the chest, but otherwise are identical in coloration with typical S. m. anahcls' 

 from the San Pedro Martir Mountains and are equally large. An adult male from 

 Alhambra, Los Angeles County, and several from the eastern slope of the Sierra 

 Nevada, are in all respects identical in coloration with San Pedro Martir examples, 

 even that from Mount Lassen, at the northern end of the Sierra range, having a mere 

 trace of chestnut on sides of back and the chestnut of under parts either interrupted 

 by blue in middle of chest or else the two lateral areas barely confluent. 



Average measurements of series from the San Pedro Martir Mountains, San Diego 

 and Los Angeles counties, and the east slope of the Sierra Nevada, together with those 

 of S. m. occidentalis, are as follows:

a Twenty-one specimens. 



b Eighteen specimens. • 



Specimens from the United States compare in average measurements with breeding 

 examples from northwestern Mexico as follows: The two series are essentially alike 

 in color, but the adult males from Mexico all have the whole dorsal regipn "solid" 

 chestnut, or rufous-chestnut, and the females are slightly darker in general coloration. 

 In short, the form reaches its most perfect development, with characters more accen- 

 tuated and stable, in northwestern Mexico.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 157 



Adult male in winter. — Similar to the summer pluma(j;e, ])iit blue of 

 upper parts duller, that of pileum, hindneck, back, and scapulars more 

 or less obscured by pale brownish j^jray maro;ins or tips, the greater 

 wing-coverts and tertials edged with whitish or pale grayish; blue of 

 under parts washed, more or less strongly, with pale brownish gray 

 or grayish brown, especially on chest and sides of breast.

Rather small short-legged, short- and broad-billed Turdidje with 

 bill decidedly broader than high at frontal antise, gonys decidedly 

 shorter than mandibular rami, and inner webs of remiges crossed by 

 a broad basal or subbasal band of white or buff. ^ 



Bill short, broad and depressed at base, triangular in vertical 

 profile, its width at frontal anti» greatly exceeding its height at 

 same point and equal to or exceeding length of gonys; exposed 

 culmen little if any longer than outer toe (without claw), straight 

 basally (sometimes for most of its length) decurved terminally; gonys 

 decidedly shorter than mandibular rami, much less than width of 

 space between latter at base, faintly convex, strongly ascending 

 terminally; maxillary tomium nearly straight, very distinctly notched 

 subterminally. Nostril longitudinally ovoid or fusiform (usually 

 narrower at anterior end), more or less covered posteriorly by antrorse 

 bristly feathers of the frontal antije, overhung by .membrane. Rictal 

 and decumbent post-nasal bristles strongly developed, especially the 

 former; feathers of chin with slender, recurved bristle-like points. 

 Wing moderate to long, rounded, the longest primaries exceeding 

 longest secondaries by less than length of tarsus to combined length 

 of tarsus and middle toe (without claw) ; outermost (tenth) primary 

 longer than primary coverts, one-third {M. townsendi) %^ nearly one- 

 half ( M. melanops) as long as ninth, rather narrow, wit'h roimded tip, 

 except in M. solitarius and allies (not M. sihilans, however) , in which 

 it is subfalcate; ninth primary shorter than third {M. melanops) to 

 longer than fourth {M. toionsendi) ; eighth, seventh and sixth, seventh 

 and sixth, or sixth and fifth primaries longest ; four primaries (eighth, 

 seventh, sixth, and fifth) with outer web sinuated, but sinuation rather 

 indistinct, especially on eighth or fifth, where sometimes hardly aj^pre- 

 ciable. Tail nearly equal to or slightly longer than wing, double- 

 rounded, the lateral rectrices usually shorter than middle pair ])ut 

 sometimes longer; rectrices rather soft, tapering more or less distinctly, 

 the tip narrowly rounded or sometimes subacvnninate. Tarsus short 

 and slender, one-sixth to decidedly more than one-fourth as long as wing, 

 the acrotarsium booted ; middle toe (without claw) two-thirds to three- 



fl As in the genera Hylocichla, Ixoreus, Cichloselys, Ridgwayia, Oreocichla, and Geo- 

 dchla.

fourths as Ions;- as tarsus; lateral toes equal or very nearly so, boih 

 reaching (without claw) very slightly beyond subterminal articulation 

 of middle toe (M. ohscurus, M. unicolor, and M. melanops) or the 

 outer one longer, reaching (without claw) decidedly beyond the 

 joint mentioned (other species); hallux shorter than inner toe but 

 much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe united for basal half or 

 more to outer toe, for less than basal half to inner toe ; claws moderate 

 in size, strongly curved, acute, that of the hallux shorter than its 

 digit (sometimes nearly as long in AI. townsendi). 



Coloration. — Adults never spotted nor streaked; upper parts 

 plain bluish slate, gray, brown, or dull rufous (if brown or rufous 

 the head usually grayer), the secondaries showing a more or less 

 distinct broad blackish or dusky sub-basal band, their inner webs 

 with a broad basal band of white or buffy, this continued, less 

 definitely over middle portion of primaries; mider parts plain gray- 

 ish, dull white becoming pale brownish gray on chest and sides {M. 

 elizahetli), or gray with rufous throat-patch and under tail-coverts 

 (Haitien, Jamaican, and Lesser An tillean species); lateral rectrices 

 with more or less of white; sexes alike; young conspicuously spotted, 

 above as well as below, with buff or ochraceous, the spots margined 

 with blackish. 



Nidification. — Nest (of M. toivnsendi) placed in cavities among 

 rocks or banks, old logs or stumps, or similar situations, bulky, 

 open above, composed of twigs, shreds of bark, etc., lined with finer 

 materials; eggs (of M. to'wnsendi) whitish, speckled with reddish 

 brown. 



Range. — Mountain districts of western North America, Mexico, 

 Central America, northern South America, and West Indies (islands 

 of Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, JMartinique, Dominica, Santa Lucia, and

' In a large series of specimens (including many not represented in Ihe al)ove meas- 

 urements) I am not able to make out satisfactorily any geographic variation. The 

 specimens from Chihuahua, Durango, and Zacatecas, however, have the ochraceous- 

 Iniff band across under surface of remiges deeper in color, and the general coloration 

 ^^eems slightly darker and browner. 



cA still more southern locality (Sierra de Bolafios, Jalisco) is cited by Salviii and 

 Godman (Ibis, 1889, 381), Init the date at which specimens were obtained is not given.

THE MOCKING BIRDS. * 



SleiKlcr-blllecl, ten-priiiiaried, iicutij)lantar Osciiies, with laro;e tenth 

 |>riinary, ol)viou.s rictal bristles (exeept in ('(dyptophilu^), loral feath- 

 ers without bristly points, iinier toe almost or wholly free at l)ase from 

 middle toe, and aerotarsium more or less distinetly scutellate." 



Bill exceedin^fly variable in shape and relative length, sometimes 

 only half as k)n<^ as head, sometimes lon<i;er than head, terete (exeept 

 in ('alyptopliilus, in whieh eonoid or su})euneate and much com- 

 pressed), usually faintly decurved terminally, sometimes (in species 

 of Toxostoitid) cons])icuously decurved, often straiojht or very nearly so; 

 base of gon^'s always distinctly anterior to anterior end of nasal fossa 

 (exce))t in ('alyptopJdlus); maxillary tomium more or le.>is distinctly 

 notched subterminally, except in genus Toxostoma only. Nasal fossae 

 rather short or small, largely occujned by the usually oval, ovate, or 

 elliptical (rarely roundish) or nearh' linear (horizontal) nostril, the lat- 

 ter always exposed, always overhung by membrane, usually in con- 

 tact ])osteri()rly with feathering of the frontal antiie. Feathers of 

 frontal antia' and loral region without bristly points, usually soft and 

 decuml)ent (erect and harsh only in Calypio philus) . Kictal bristles 

 obvious (except in Calypto pliilus) , never very strong, usually rather 

 weak and few in number. Wing variable as to relative length, but 

 always more or less roimded, the outermost (tenth) ])rimary usually 

 at least half as long as the ninth (nuich less than half as long as ninth 

 only in Oroscoptes), as long as longest secondaries onl}^ in (\ily pto plii- 

 lus. Tail variable in rela.tive length, ])ut never distinctly shorter 

 than distance from bend of wing to tip of longest secondaries, usually 

 about as long as the wing or somewhat longer, sometimes much 

 longer, always more or less rounded (graduated for nearly half its 

 length in Donacobius). Tarsus variable in relative length (extremes 

 being one-fourth as long as wing in Allenia and two-fifths as long in 

 Donacohius) , the aerotarsium always more or less distinctly scutellate, 

 though the divisions are sometimes indistinct or even obsolete;'' mid- 

 dle toe (without claw) always distinctly shorter than tarsus, usually 

 about two-thirds as long (decidedl}^ less than two-tiiirds as long only 

 in NesomiTnus, three-fourths as long only in Allenia and Margarops). 



oin a few genera (Galeoscoptes, Melanoptila, and Cinclocerthia) the divisions of the 

 aerotarsium are sometimes indistinct, but careful examination with a magnifying 

 glass will reveal them, at least along the anterior edge or inner side. The same is 

 true regarding the rictal bristles, which in some genera (notably Cinclotherthia) are 

 very small and not easily seen l)y tlic unaided eye. In CdhjplophihiK alone they 

 appear to l)e wholly wanting. 



b That is to say, not easy to discover without aid of a magnifying lens. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 181 



Lateral toes unequal (except in Donacohius) ,<" the inner reachino; 

 (without claw) to the subterniinal joint (articulation) of the middle 

 toe, the outer slightly, but distinctly, longer; hallux shorter (or at 

 least not long-er) than inner toe; basal phalanx of middle toe united 

 for half its length (or slightly more) to the outer toe, but almost 

 wholly free from inner toe; claws normal in size and curvature 

 (rather small and w^eak in Oroscoptes, larger and stouter or more 

 strongly curved than usual in Margarops and CinclocertMa) . 



Osteological characters of theMimidfe'' are as follows: Anteorbital 

 region narrow; descending process of nasal narrow, the angle 

 subtended l)y this i)rocess and the pars plena rather acute; maxillo- 

 palatines claviform (except in Oaleoscoptes); costal process of 

 sternum moderate in size, somewhat acuminate; coracoid with a 

 moderate flange on epicoracoidal portion; pelvis rather compressed, 

 but with ilia inclined from the horizontal. 



That the Mmida^ are distinct as a group from both the Troglody- 

 tidfp and Turdida-, with each of which they have been associated, 

 is shown by the following comparison of their most prominent 

 osteologicaf character, adapted from :Mr. Lucas's paper, previously 

 referred to: 



COMPARISON or OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS OF TROGLOnYTID.E, MIMID.r,, AND 



TURDID.E. 



a. Anteorbital region nan-ow; descending process of nasal narrow; costal process of 

 sternum small or moderate, more or less acuminate; coracoid with a short or mod- 

 erate flange on epicoracoidal portion; pelvis more or less compressed, with ilia 

 inclined from the horizontal. 

 b. Descending process of nasal slender, the angle formed hy this and the pars plana 

 more open; maxillo-palatines acuminate posteriorly; costal process of sternum 

 small, more acuminate; flange of coracoid shurlcr; ilia more inclined fmni lln^ 



horizontal, the pelvis narrower posteriorly Troglodytids. 



bb. Descending process of nasal narrow but not slender, the angle formed by thi.s and 

 the pars plana more acute; maxillo-palatines claviform (except in (ialcn- 

 scoptes);c costal process of sternum longer, less acuminate; flange of coracoid 

 longer; ilia less inclined from ihe horizontal, th(> ]ielvis broader anteriorly. 



Mimidae. 



aa. Anteorbital region wide; descending process of nasal wide; costal process of 

 sternum large, blunt, rhomboidal in outline; coracoid with a wide flange run- 

 ning half way up the shaft; pelvis broad, flattened Turdidae. 



oThe proportions of the toes in ])onar<,l>!n^ are differcMit from those of any other 

 genus in the funiilv, both lateral toes (which are equal in length) extending (without 

 claw) to decidedly beyond the subterminal arlieulation of the middle toe. wlule the 

 hallux is quite as long as the lateral toes.

182 BULLETIN r)0, UNTTED STATES NATT()NAT> MT'SEUM. 



The IMocking Thrushes are apparently most nearly related to 

 the true Thrushes (Turdida:^) , and evidently occupy an intermediate 

 position between the latter and the Wrens (Troglodytida^), thouuh 

 Mr. Lucas's investigation of their osteok)oical structure" shows that 

 thej^ are not so nearly allied with the latter as with the former. 

 According to Mr. Lucas the Mimidse are, as a group, "fairly well 

 marked," though (raleoscopte,<^ is aberrant, ''having a very charac- 

 teristic shape to the maxillo-palatine process. This maxillo-palatine 

 is so entirely different [in other MimidcT] from that of the Wrens 

 that from what little experience I have had I should hesitate to unite 

 two groups so dissimilar in this respect. On the other hand, (kileo- 

 scoptes has such decided leanings toward the Thrushes, not only in 

 its skull, but in other portions of the skeleton, that it would seem 

 to connect them with the Miminte. Be this as it nuw, (kdeoscoptes 

 is certainly nearer to the Tlirushes than any other member of its 

 group, while IlarporJiyrichus [i. e., Toxostoma] seems to be the far- 

 thest removed." Externally, the Mimida^ differ from the Turdidfe 

 in their scutellate tarsi (though the divisions are, as previously 

 stated, sometimes indistinct), and in their shorter, more rounded 

 wings; from the Troglodytida?, the most wren-like genera, difier in 

 their well-developed rictal bristles and (all the genera) in having the 

 inner toe entirely free at the base from the middle one. 



In their habits and general appearance the IMocking Thrushes 

 resemble both the true Thrushes and the Wrens. They are all 

 songsters of greater or less merit, many of them being preeminent as 

 vocalists, while some of the species of the genus M'mtus are at least 

 the most brilliant and remarkable vocalists of all birds. 



The ]\Iimi(he are an exclusively American group, most numerously 

 represented, both as to genera and species, in Mexico. Only two of 

 the fourteen genera occur in South America, which possesses but one 

 genus {DonacohiuH) not found elsewhere. Five geiK^ra (Margarops, 

 Allenia, Iliunpliocindus, Cinclocerthia, and CalyptoplillusY are 

 peculiar to the West Indies, one {Nesomimus) to the Galapagos 

 Archipelago and one (Mimodes) to the island of Socorro, off north- 

 western IMexico. Two genera {Galeoscn.ptes and Oroscoptes) are 

 peculiar to North America north of Afexico;'' two {Melanofis and 

 Melnnoptila) are peculiar to Mexico, one (Toxostoma) is common to 

 Mexico and the United States (best represented in the former and 

 southwestern portion of the latter) while only one ( Mimus) is found 

 throughout the whole extent of the Neotropical Region and warmer 

 portions of the Nearctic Region.

Bill about as long as or longer than head (exposed culmen slightly 

 shorter than middle toe without claw to decidedly longer than middle

 rather short and rounded, the longest primaries exceeding longest 

 secondaries by less than length of -middle toe without claw ; outer- 

 most (tenth) primary about half as long as ninth or slightly more, 

 sometimes more than half as long as longest primary; ninth primary 

 shorter than or equal to secondaries, in some species longer than third 

 primary; eighth to fifth prhiiaries longest. Tail decidedly longer 

 than wing (sometimes much longer), distinctly rounded, its gradua- 

 tion varying from much less than length of middle toe without claw 

 (in T. cineremn and T. hendirei) to nearly the length of tarsus (in T. 

 ocellatum), the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate; middle toe (without 

 claw) about two-thirds as long as tarsus; lateral toes unequal, the 

 inner (without claw) reaching to subterminal joint of middle toe, the 

 outer slightly beyond; hallux shorter than inner toe, but much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe united to outer toe for alxnit 

 half its length, almost wholly free from inner toe.

 Florida and south-central Texas Harris County, Bexar County, etc.). 



a Twenty-three specimens. 



b Fourteen specimens. 



Specimens from the region of the Great Phiins average larger and slightly ])aler in 

 color of upper parts than those from more eastern localities, but, as well as I am 

 able to judge from the rather unsatisfactory series of western examples, the difference 

 is too inconstant to justify recognition of a western form. Average measurements 

 are as follows: 



If three males from Texas and one from Fort Rice, North Dakota (with tail ranging 

 from 123.5 to 124.5). are transferred to the Mississippi Valley series, and one from 

 lUoomington, Illinois (with tail measuring 132) transferred to the extreme western 

 s(>ries, as possibly they should be. the difference in measurements would of course 

 be much more pronounced.

b Two adult males from Rio Verde, San Luis Potosi, are equal to the largest examples 

 of T. I. scnneffi from Texas in size (wing 102.5-103.5, tail 133.5) but are brighter or more 

 rufescent brown above, in this respect only agreeing Ijetter with T. I. longirostre. 

 Two adult females from the same locality, while agreeing better in coloration with 

 the southern form, are decidedly larger, having the wing 99.5-105.5, tail 136-138, 

 instead of wing 93-94.5, tail 120-125, as in two females of T. I. longirostre from Vera

TOXOSTOMA CINEREUM CINEREUM (Xantus). 

 SAN LUCAS THRASHER. 



Most nearly related to T. hendirei, but bill larfi;er and spots on under 

 parts much larger and blackish instead of grayish brown. « 



Adults in spring and summer. — Above plain grayish brown (hair 

 brown or l)etween hair brown and broccoli brown), more decidedly 

 brown (wood brown) on rump and upper tail-coverts, the remiges and 

 rectrices darker; middle and greater wing-coverts more or less dis- 

 tinctly tipped with paler, usually with white, forming two narrow 

 bands ;^ remiges edged with paler grayish brown, these edgings ap- 

 proaching dull whitish on primaries ; inner web of outermost rectrix 

 broadly tipped with dull vrhite, the outer web more narrowly tipped 

 with the same; other rectrices (except middle pair) similarly marked 

 but the whitish tip narrower; sides of head dull whitish, the auricular 

 region streaked, the suborbital and malar regions flecked or barred, 

 with grayish brown; under parts buffy white, passing into pale l)uff

Young. — Essentially like adults, but pileum, hindneck, and back 

 light buffy grayish brown (between broccoli brown and wood brown), 

 passing into cinnamon on rump and upper tail-coverts; middle and 

 greater wing-coverts tipped with cinnamon-buft", the tertials margined

TOXOSTOMA CURVIROSTRE CURVIROSTRE (Swainson). 

 CURVE-BILLED THRASHER. 



Adults ill spring and summer. — Above plain brownish gray (drab- 

 gray) ; middle and greater wing-coverts narrowh^ tipped with w hite, 

 forming two narrow, sometimes indistinct (rarely obsolete) bands; 

 outer webs of alulae edged terminally with white; lateral rectrices 

 abruptly tipped with white, this broader on inner web (about 8-13 

 mm. wide on that of outermost rectrix) ; superciliary region and auric- 

 ular region somewhat lighter gray than upper parts, the latter usually 

 finely and indistinctly streaked with white; malar region dull white, 

 more or less flecked with gr&j; under parts buffy white, deepening 

 into pale brownish buff on flanks, anal region, and under tail-coverts, 

 the chest, breast, and upper abdomen spotted with pale brownish 

 gray, the sides nearly uniformly this color; bill blackish or dusky, the 

 lower basal portion of mandible more or less distinctly paler; iris 

 orange or orange-yellow ; legs and feet horn color (in dried skins) . 



Adults in, autumn and winter. — Similar to the spring and summer 

 plumage, but gray of upper parts deeper and less brownish (between 

 drab-gray and smoke gray) , and spots on under parts larger and deeper 



gray. 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but upper parts browner, middle 

 and greater w4ng-coverts narrowly tipped with grayish buffy instead 

 of white, terminal spot of lateral rectrices confined to inner web, much 

 less sharply defined, and pale grayish bufi^y instead of white, and 

 markings on under parts more longitudinal or streak-like.

oThe seasonal differences in coloration in this species are, according to tlie material 

 examined (about thirty adults) not sulTiciently marked to justify separate descrip-

 brown, and the grayish brown color of the chest is less pronounced; but as late as June 

 the coloration is practically the same as in autumn and winter.

« Nine specimens. 



Specimens fnnn eastern Mexico compare with those from western Mexico in average 

 measurements as follows: 



The single specimen (an adult male) from Chihuahua (Jesus Maria, April 8) is slightly 

 but decidedly paler than any other specimen examined, though some Mazatlan 

 examples are nearly as pale. If the difference presented by this specimen were con- 

 stant in a series from Chihuahua, the bird of that extreme northern locality would 

 constitute a well-marked form. The series of specimens from eastern ^[exico is much 

 too small to show whether they differ constantly from western birds. The few exam- 

 ined apparently do not.

 Sloliovnmus Bryant, Proc. Bost. Soc. N. H., xi, ISjili (pub. 1867), 68. (Type, 

 Mimvs bahamcnsis Bryant.) 



Large to rather small Mimida:' (length about 200 300 nun.) with 

 hill much shorter than head, tail equal to or longer (often much 

 longer) than wing, middle toe (without claw) much more than three- 

 fifths (usually about two-thirds) as long as tarsus, and with more or 

 less of white on tail and wings, the general coldr grayish above, whitish 

 beneath. 



Bill much shorter than head (exposed culmen shorter than middle 

 toe without claw) ; cidmen gradually curved for at least terminal 

 half, sometimes almost from base; gonys straight or (rarely) very 

 faintly concave sub terminally; maxillary tomium gently (some- 

 times decidedly) concave anterior to middle portion, distinctly 

 notched subterminall}^ Nostril broadly oval or ovate, overhung 

 by membrane, posteriorly nearly if not quite in contact with feather- 

 ing of frontal antife. Rictal bristles well developed. Wing rather 

 long (especially primaries, the longest of which exceed longest second- 

 aries by more than length of exposed culmen), rounded; outermost 

 (tenth) primary usually more than half as long as ninth but less 

 than half as long as eighth,'* the ninth usually intermediate between 

 fourth and third (shorter than third only in M. gracilis) , the seventh 

 and sixth, or eighth, seventh, and sixth, longest. Tail usually longer 

 than wing (not longer only in M. triurus), often very much longer, 

 strongly rounded, the rectrices moderately broad to (relatively) rather 

 narrow, with tips broadly rounded. Tarsus moderate to rather long 

 (a little more than one-fourth to nearly one-third as long as wing) 

 rather slender, the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate; middle toe 

 (without claw) about two-thirds as long as tarsus, sometimes a little 

 less; lateral toes unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to sub- 

 terminal joint of middle toe, the outer slightly beyond; hallux 

 slightly shorter than inner toe but much stouter; basal phalanx of 

 middle toe adherent for about half its length to outer toe, almost 

 wholly free from inner toe; claws normal as to size and curvature. 



Coloration. — Above gray or grayish brown, with or without darker 

 streaks, the wings w^ith two whitish or pale grayish bands and wdiitish 

 or pale grayish edgings (sometimes with larger white areas), the 

 lateral rectrices with more or less of white; under parts dull whitish, 

 with or wdthout streaks on flanks. Young with chest, etc., conspicu- 

 ously speckled or spotted with dusky. 



a An exception, apparently, is found in M. triurus, of which the single specimen 

 examined has the outermost primary exactly half as long as the eighth. This species 

 is fm'ther aberrant in having the tail no longer than the wing. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 223 



Nidification. — Nest (so far as known) open above, rather bulky, 

 placed in dense shrubs, small trees, or thick vine-growth. Eggs 

 (3-5) pale greenish or whitish, speckled or spotted with brown. 



Range. — The whole of temperate and tropical America (except 

 Galapagos and Eevillagigedo islands. (About twenty species and 

 subspecies.)

a Mr. Cory refers the mockingbirds of Andros, Biminis, and Abaco islands, Bahamas, 

 to the continental form, and so far as I have been able to examine specimens he seems 

 to be essentially right in doing so. I liave only seen one each from Andros and 

 Abaco, and none from the Biminis. The Andros and Abaco specimens examined 

 certainly agree with M. p. polyglottos in having the inner web of the third rectrix 

 dusky for much the greater part; but they seem to be, like other West Indian speci- 

 mens (if. p. elegans and M. p. orpheus) whiter beneath as well as smaller, and thus 

 representing intergrades between the continental and Antillean forms. Comparative 

 measurements are as follows:

After carefully comparing the above considerable series of specimens I am unable to 

 make out satisfactorily differences between specimens from different islands sufficient, 

 in my judgment, to justify separation into local forms. An exception may be made 

 in the case of birds from Haiti, which seem to have the white on the inner primaries 

 decidedly more extended than those from other islands, only one of the four un- 

 doubted males from that island examined having as large a space of dusky on the sub- 

 terminal portion of the innermost (first) primary as that showing the smallest amount 

 from other islands, while in one of the four the innermost primary is entirely white. 

 A larger series from Haiti would be necessary to settle the question, however.

MIMUS GILVUS GILVUS (Vieillot). 

 GUIANA MOCKINGBIRD. 



Adult male. — Above plain brownish gray (mouse gray, or between 

 mouse gray and smoke gray), the pileum narrowly streaked with 

 dusky; wings and tail dull blackish slate, with pale gray edgings, 

 these broader and merging gradually into the darker color on greater 

 wing-coverts, secondaries, and rectrices, narrower, sharply defined, 

 and paler (usually white, or nearly so) on primaries; middle and 

 greater wing-coverts more or less distinctly tipped with pale gray or 

 grayish white, forming two narrow and fairly distinct bands; rectrices 

 (except middle pair) abruptly tipped with white, more extensively on 

 inner web, the white terminal area on lateral rectrix about 23-35 mm. 

 in length, on other rectrices decreasing in extent toward middle pair; 

 an indistinct superciliary stripe of grayish white, becoming purer 

 white anteriorly, where involving upper portion of lores; a duskj^ 

 loral streak, broadest at anterior angle of eye; a dusky or dark gray 

 postocular streak; suborbital, malar, and auricular regions (except 

 upper portion of the last) white, the auricular region more or less 

 tinged or streaked with pale gray, the suborbital region usually with 

 minute dusky bars; under parts white, the chest and sides of breast 

 more or less strongly tinged with pale gray, the flanks and under tail- 

 coverts more or less tinged with buff; flankg broadly streaked with 

 dusky, the shorter under tail-coverts usually narrowdy streaked with 

 the same; bill black, the basal portion of mandible more or less 

 brownish; iris j^ellowish; legs and feet dusky (in dried skins); length 

 (skins), 200-239 (220); wing, 98-106.5 (102); tail, 94-113.5 (102.9); 

 exposed culmen, 17-19 (17.7); tarsus, 29.5-33.5 (32.7); middle toe, 

 19.5-21.5 (20.6).« 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male, but slightly smaller, chest 

 more strongly tinged with pale gray, and white tips to rectrices 

 slightly smaller; length (skins), 203-238 (228); wmg 95.5-105.5 



o Thirteen specimens from Lesser Antilles.

Young. — Above light grayish brown (more decidedly brown on 

 rump and upper tail-coverts), sometimes indistinctly streaked with 

 dusky, especially on back and rump ; chest and sides of breast spotted

o Eight specimens from Lesser Antilles. 



Specimens from the different islands (so far as sexed specimens are represented in 

 the series examined) compare in average measurements as follows: 



Having only one Guiana specimen for comparison, I cannot be sure that the West 

 Indian birds of this species are really referable to the typical form. If they are, it 

 seems reasonable to suppose they were first introduced into the French islands from- 

 Guiana, since a recognizably distinct form {M. gilvus tobagensu) occupies the inter- 

 mediate island of Tobago. The single Guiana specimen examined is certainly very 

 similar to most examples from the Lesser Antilles, but has a smaller bill than any of 

 them, and is also less in some other measurements. The middle and greater wing- 

 coverts are also more distinctly tipped with white. 



b Possibly introduced into one or more of the West India islands named above from 

 Guiana.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 239 



MIMUS GILVUS GUATEMALENSIS Ridgway. 

 GUATEMALA MOCKINGBIRD. 



Similar to M. g. columbianus , but base of outer webs of primaries 

 (concealed, or mostly so, by primary coverts) white; gray of upper 

 parts slightly browner; wings and tail decidedly blacker, the middle 

 wing-coverts more broadly and abrupth^ tipped with white,** instead 

 of pale gray; white of under parts much less pure, the chest pale buffy 

 gray, the flanks and under tail-coverts more strongly buffy. Young 

 with general color of upper parts paler, middle and greater wing- 

 coverts broadly and abruptly tipped with pure white (instead of nar- 

 rowly tipped with pale buff), tertials broadly margined with white 

 (these markings in 21. g. columbianus pale brownish buff or wood 

 brown, passing mto white terminally), and markings on under parts 

 confined to chest and sides (wanting, or nearly so, on flanks) roundish, 

 instead of longitudinal, and somewhat paler grayish brown. 



Adult maZf'.— Length (skins), 245-255 (249); wing, 108.5-115.5 

 (111.9); tail, 111.5-135.5 (124.4); exposed culmen, 17.5-19.5 (18.4); 

 tarsus, 31.5-34.5 (32.7); middle toe, 21-22.5 (21. g).'' 



Adult female. — Length (skins), 232; wing, 102.5; tail, 108; exposed 

 culmen, 17; tarsus, 31; middle toe, 19.5.^ 



Highlands of Guatemala (San Geronimo; Salama; plains of Zacapa; 

 upper Montagua Valley; Duenas; Jutiapa; Capetillo-Suchitepequez; 

 Nehaj-Quitche) and Chiapas (San Cristobal; Valley of Comitan; 

 Ocuilapa; Ocozucuantla; Jiquipilas) ; Tabasco (Frontera) ; southern 

 Vera Cruz (Coatzacoalcos) ? <* 



fl These white tips, conspicuous in fresh phimage, are obsolete, through abrasion, in 

 worn "midsummer" pkimage. 



'' Four specimens, from Chiapas and Guatemala. 



c One specimen, from Coatzacoalcos, Vera Cruz. 



d I am somewhat doubtful as to the correctness of referring specimens from Frontera 

 and Coatzacoalcos to the present form. All the specimens from the latter locality 

 examined (six in number) are in much more worn plumage than those from Chiapas 

 and Guatemala, therefore the two series are not satisfactorily comparable. Making due 

 allowance for this difference in their condition, the two series agi-ee closely, the 

 Coatzacoalcos specimens being slightly smaller, though this difference may be partly 

 accounted for by wearing away of extreme tips to the primaries and rectrices. Should 

 the correctness of referring the Coatzacoalcos and Frontera specimens to M. g. giiate- 

 malensis be established, the northern part of the range of this form would constitute a 



wedge" separating the range of M. g. laivrencei (in Oaxaca) from that of M. g. gracilis 

 (in Campeche and Yucatan). 



Average measurements of males of the two series are as follows:

 footnote. (Type, Orpheus melanotis Gould.) 



Medium-sized to large Mimidse (length 190-270 mm.) with long 

 slender tarsus (decidedly more than one-third longer than middle 

 toe without claw), tail not longer than wing (usually shorter), nostril 

 narrow, horizontally linear or elliptical, and plumage of upper parts 

 variegated with brownish gray or grayish brown, dusky, and whitish.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 245 



Bill variable as to relative length, sometimes equal to or slightly 

 longer than head (exposed culmen shorter than middle toe without 

 claw and longer than toe with claw), sometimes much shorter, but 

 always slender and appreciably decurved terminally, and with 

 breadth at frontal antiae about equal to its height at same point; 

 culmen nearly straight basally, gradually becoming more decurved 

 toward tip ; gonys nearly straight (usually slightly concave in middle 

 portion, its hase decidedly anterior to nostril; maxillary tomium 

 gently concave, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril hori- 

 zontal, narrow (narrowly oval, elliptical, or linear), overhung "by 

 narrow membrane, posteriorly in contact with feathering of frontal 

 antia?. Rictal bristles obvious, but few. and weak. Wing rather 

 long and pointed, the longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries 

 by length of middle toe (without claw) or more, the eighth and 

 seventh, or eighth, seventh, and sixth, primaries longest, the ninth 

 very much longer than secondaries, the tenth (outermost) not more 

 (usually less) than half as long as ninth. Tail not longer than wing 

 (usuall}" decidedly shorter), strongly rounded (the graduation about 

 equal to length of exposed culmen or to length of middle toe without 

 claw). Tarsus long and slender (slightly less to more than one-third 

 as long as wing, always decidedly longer than exposed culmen, some- 

 times twice as long), the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate; middle 

 toe (without claw) decidedly less than two-thirds as long as tarsus; 

 lateral toes unequal, the inner (without claw) reaching to subterminal 

 joint of middle toe, the outer slightly beyond; hallux shorter than 

 inner toe but much stouter; claws normal in size and curvature; 

 basal phalanx of middle toe adherent to that of outer toe for about 

 half its length, to that of inner toe for basal portion only. 



Coloration. — Upper parts variegated with brownish gra}^ (or 

 grayish brown), dusky, and whitish; beneath dull whitish, streaked 

 on flanks with dusky, the chest or sides of breast sometimes spotted 

 with dusky. Young with under parts always spotted on chest, etc. 



Nidijication. — Nest and eggs essentially like those of the genus 

 Mimus. $ 



Range. — Galapagos Archipelago. (Eleven species, or forms.)

I regret my inability to present a more satisf actor}^ ' ' ke}' ' ' to the 

 forms of this difficult group, but the material at my command is far 

 too meager for successful treatment of the subject. In the con- 

 struction of the ''key/' in framing the diagnoses, and in deciding 

 which are tenable forms I have been obliged to depend largely on 

 the papers of ISIessrs. Rothschild and Hartert and Snodgrass and 

 Heller, respectively, and use my best judgment in deciding questions 

 as to which the authorities cited are at variance. In such cases 

 my conclusion has favored the views of Messrs. Snodgrass and Heller 

 as being later and based on additional material. 



Messrs. Rothschild and Hartert consider all the forms character- 

 ized above, except N. frifasciatus, N. macdoiialdi, and N. adamsi, as 

 subspecies of N. melanotis, while Snodgrass and Heller recognize iV. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 247 



personafus as a distinct species, to which .V. hindloei, N. hauri, and 

 N. hulli are referred as subspecies. Until these forms are much 

 better understood than they are at present, however, it seems to me 

 best to treat them all as specifically distinct, though most likely their 

 segregation into a smaller number of specific types may eventually 

 be found to more correctly express their relationships.

" To Dr. J. A. Allen. 




262 BULLETIN no, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MLTSEUM. 



Bill about half as long as head (shorter than middle toe without 

 claw), much broader than deep at base, its width at frontal antise 

 equal to much more than half the distance from nostril to tip of max- 

 illa; exposed culmen shorter than middle toe without claw, gradually 

 curved from base, slightly arched; gonys faintly convex, ascending

 outermost (tenth) primary about half as long as ninth, the latter 

 nearly as long as fourth; seventh and sixth primaries longest. Tail 

 decidedly shorter than wing, slightly rounded (graduation equal to 

 little more than half the length of middle toe without claw) , the rec- 

 trices rather rigid. Tarsus short (about one-fourth as long as wing),

 middle pair) with a terminal white spot, decreasing in size tow^ard 

 the middle pair; sides of head and neck similar in color to upper 

 parts; under parts lighter sepia brown, becoming w^'hite on abdomen, 

 anal region, and under tail-coverts (sometimes on median portion of

 f^pecimens from different islands, while as to measurements the individual variation 

 is very marked (if sexing of specimens is to Ix' trusted) without r(>gard to locality.

 priority because he had already described the species in manuscript. His eccentric

 of explanation.

CINCLOCERTHIA MACRORHYNCHA Sclater. 

 SANTA LUCIA TREMBLER. 



Adults {sexes alike). — Above plain grayish olive or slightly olivaceous 

 hair brown, the pileum darker, the lower rump, uj^per tail-coverts, 

 wings, and tail browner, the greater wing-coverts and remiges (some- 

 times rectrices also) with paler brownish indistinct edgings; loral, 

 suborbital, and auricular regions dusky, the last sometimes with very 

 indistinct narrow shaft-streaks of paler; malar region pale sooty 

 grayish, the feathers more or less distinctly margined with rusty; 

 luider parts dull buffy whitish or pale grayish buffy, the under 

 tail-coverts pale cinnamon or wood brow^n, the flanks tinged with 

 the same, the sides tinged with olive-grayish; axillars and imder 

 wing-coverts pale grayish buff; bill blackish, the lower basal portion 

 of mandible, more or less extensively, paler; iris yellow'' or brown ;'^ 

 legs and feet clear horn color (in dried skins). '^ 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but chest faintl}' spotted or mot- 

 tled with grayish brown. 



Adult male.— \j(^Mgih (skins), 215-238 (227); wing, 104-1 13 (107.4); 

 tail, 79-90 (87); exposed culmen, 35-40 (37); tarsus, 30-31.5 (30.6); 

 middle toe, 21.5-23 (22.7).^^ 



Adult female.— hewgiXi (skins), 205-215 (210); wing, 100-104 

 (101.7); tail, 78.5-83 (81.5); exposed culmen, 34-39.5 (36.5); tar- 

 sus, 30-31 (30.5); middle toe, 22-23 (22.3)./ 



a It is impossible to determine from the colored plate (pi. 10) in the Exotic Orni- 

 thology which form it is intended to represent, none of them having either the under 

 parts or wings nearly so rufescent. Judging from the large size and especially the 

 very long bill, however, it seems likely that the specimen (of unknown locality) 

 from which the illustration was made was an example of the jiresent subspecies.

280 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



The following characters are given by Oates, in "The Fauna of 

 British India:" "- 



The intrinsic muscles of the syrinx fixed to the ends of the bronchial semi-rings; 

 the edges of both mandibles smooth, or the upper one simply notched; hinder aspect 

 of tarsus bilaminated, the laminse entire and smooth; wing with ten primaries; nos- 

 trils always clear of the line of the forehead, the space between the nostril and the 

 edge of the mandible less than the space between the nostril and the culmen ; plumage 

 of the nestling typically streaked; no rictal bristles nor vestige of any; sexes alike 

 or very nearly so; rectrices twelve; first jirimary minute; one moult in the year. 



Notwithstanding Gates' statement that "the Sturnidse or the 

 Starhngs and Mynas, as restricted in this work, form one of the best 

 defined families of the Passeres," one searches in vain in the diag- 

 nosis wdiich he gives for characters which woukl support this state-: 

 ment. On the other hand, the diagnosis above quoted is identical, 

 almost word for word, with that given for tlie "Eulabetida?," on 

 page 509 of the same work, except as to the rictal bristles, which 

 are said to be "present" in the Eulabetidie, while in the Sturnidse 

 there are "no rictal bristles nor vestige of any" — certainly a very 

 slight distinction. 



It may be further remarked that the 3^oung of the Sturnidas are 

 not always streaked, while in those that are most so the streaking 

 is confined to the under parts and is not by any means conspicuous. 



The Starlings are an exclusively Old World group, a single species 

 only being included in the North American list as a purely accidental 

 straggler from Europe to Greenland and as an introduced species, 

 apparently naturalized in the vicinity of New York City and perhaps 

 in other localities in the eastern United States. 



There are recognized in the Catalogue of Birds in the British 

 Museum,'' forty genera and about one hundred and fifty species of 

 the subfamily Sturninte, the geographic range of which, as indicated 

 by the genera, is as follows: 



Genora. 



Occurring in the Palaearctic Region (as a whole) 2 



Occurring in the Ethiopian Region 14 



Occurring in the Indian Region (either as a whole or in the Indo-Chinese or 



Indo-Malayan Subregions) 12 



OccurringTin the Papuan Subregion (Australian Region) 5 



Genera of more restricted range occur as follows: Confined to 

 western Polynesia, 1 genus; to Celebes, 4; Philippines, 1; Sula, and 

 the Moluccas, 1 ; extreme eastern Palsearctic Region, 2 ; while one 

 genus is peculiar to each one of the following limited areas: Palestine, 

 Madagascar, Reunion, and Rodriguez.

Genus STURNUS Linnaeus. 



Stnrnus Linn.eus, Syst. Nat., ed. 10, i, 1758, 167. (Typo, by elimination, S. 

 vulgaris Linnaeus.) 



Bill elongate-conical, mucli depressed, especially toward tip, with 

 nearh" straight outlines; culmen flattened, about three-fourths as long 

 as tarsus; base of gonys decidedly anterior to anterior end of nostril; 

 nostril wholly exposed, longitudinal, overhung by a conspicuous, some- 

 what tumid and wholly unfeathered, operculum. Wing long (about 

 four and a half times as long as tarsus), pointed, the tenth (outer- 

 most) primary rudimentary and acuminate, ninth longest, the rest 

 rapidly graduated in length from the eighth; primaries exceeding 

 longest secondaries by much more than length of tarsus. Tail about 

 half as long as wing, even or very slightly emarginated. Feathers of 

 head, neck, chest, and breast narrow, elongate, those of the under 

 parts acuminate; plumage of adults more or less metallic. 



Six species, with three additional subspecies, are recognized in the 

 British ]\luseum catalogue, all of them belonging to the Paliearctic 

 or Indian regions of the Eastern Hemisphere. 



STURNUS VULGARIS Linnaeus. 

 STARLING, 



Adult male in summer. — General color glossy black, the head and 

 neck glossed with purple, the wing-coverts with blue or violet, other 

 parts (including auricular region) with green, becoming bluish, or 

 even sometimes violet, on posterior under parts; feathers of occiput, 

 hindneck, back, scapidars, and rump tipped with pale brown, produc- 

 ing conspicuous, more or less triangular, specks, the lesser, middle, 

 and greater wing-coverts, primary-coverts, remiges, rectrices, and 

 upper tail-coverts margined with the same; feathers of under parts 

 of the body tipped with white, forming narrow wedge-shaped or 

 sagittate spots, growing gradually larger posteriorly, the under tail- 

 coverts broadly margined with brownish white; tertials, primaries, 

 and rectrices with a more or less extensive central area of brownish 

 gray, bounded by a submarginal border of dull black; bill yellowish, 

 with the sides of the mandibular rami dusky; iris brown; legs and 

 feet brownish. 



Adult male in winter. — Similar to the summer plumage, l^ut the 

 l)rown tips to the feathers of the u])per part more extensive as well as 

 deeper in color, the white tips to feathers of the lower parts alsolarger, 

 and the bill dusky. 



Adult female. — Similar to the male, \\\t\\ the same seasonal difl'er- 

 ences, but slightly smaller and didler in coloration. 



Young in first winter. — Similar (o winter adults, but the l)rown tips 

 to feathers of upper parts and white tips to those of the lower surface 




282 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



much more extensive, the whole head and throat being thus spotted, 

 and the spots almost confluent on the abdomen. 



Young in first ]>lumage. — Above plain grayish brown (hair brown), 

 with narrow whitish margins to larger wing-coverts, remiges, and rec- 

 trices; beneath similar, but paler, with the chin and upper throat 

 whitish, and the abdomen broadly streaked with white.

Family PLOCEID/E. 



THE WEAVER BIRDS. 



Ten-priniaried, conirostral, Acutiplantar Oscines with the tenth 

 (outermost) primary ol^vioiisly present lint small or rudimentary. 

 (Otherwise very closel}^ resembling the Fringillid?p and Icteridte.) 



AYhether the single character of possessing one more ob^nous pri- 

 mary quill than the Fringillidte and Icteridae be considered as suffi- 

 cient to warrant the separation of the present group as a distinct 

 family is perhaps a matter admitting of difference of opinion, but 

 is one regarding which I prefer not to commit myself at present, hav- 

 ing neither the nuiterial nor opportunity for sufficient consideration 

 of the (juestion. Certain it is that the so-called Ploceidae resemble 

 so closely in general appearance, both as to external structure and 

 coloration, the true Fringillida' or Icterida^ that were it not for the 

 difference in the numl)er of de"v:eloped primaries nt) one, ])robably, 

 would for a moment think of separating them. The range of varia- 

 tion in form, colors, and habits is nearly as great as in the Fringil- 

 lida^ and Icteridse, although terrestrial forms are apparently wanting, 

 ^hiny, notably the wax-bills (genera EstHlda, Lagonosticta , etc.), the 

 woaver-fuiches (genera Mwvia, Sporseginthus, Spermestes, etc.), and 

 the so-called Java Sparrow (JPadda oryzivora) are conspicuously finch- 

 like in appearance. Others, again, especially among the African 




284 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM, 



forms, are strikingly icterine in form and coloration, some resembling 

 the hang-nests or American Orioles (genus Icterus), while certain 

 genera recall the red-wings (genus Agelaius), having the same uni- 

 form black plumage, relieved l:)y a conspicuous crimson or scarlet 

 ''shoulder" patch similarly bordered liehind by a band of white or 

 bufl'. 



The Ploceidse are peculiar to the warmer parts of the Eastern Hem- 

 isphere, where they are confined to the African, Madagascaran, Indo- 

 Malayan, and Australian regions, being most developed in the first 

 named, where, alone, tlie forms of icterine appearance occur. Two 

 species have been introduced into the Antillean island of Porto Rico, 

 where they have become naturalized, thus necessitating a notice of 

 tlie family in the present work. 



Two "subfamilies" are recognized ])y the latest authority on the 

 group." These are said to differ in the relative development of the 

 "first" (i. e. tenth) primary as follows: 



KEY TO THE " «UBFAMILIE8 " OF PLOCEID.^.. 



a. "First" primary "large, generally olituse at the end, and extending beyond the 

 primary-coverts " Ploceinse. 



aa. "First" primary" very small and falcate, attenuated toward the end . . . never 

 reaching beyond the primary (diverts, and generally falling conspicuously short 

 of the latt er " Viduinae. 



The two species which have been introduced into Porto Rico belong- 

 to the "Yiduin^," and represent different genera which may be dis- 

 tinguished as follows : 



KEY TO THE AMERICAN (INTRODUCED) GENERA OF VIDUIN.'E. 



«. Tail slightly graduated, the difference in length between outermost and middle 



rectrices less than length of exposed culmen Spermestes (p. 2<S4)

Very small, finch-like Ploccidas with the outermost (tenth) primary 

 minute (but little if any longer than the primary coverts), very 

 narrow, pointed, and rigid; tail nearly as long as wing, much grad- 

 uated (graduation about twice the length of exposed culmen), the 

 lateral rectrices terminating at tips of longest under tail-coverts.

 about equal to distance from maxilla to ti]) of nostril, its basal 

 width decidedly less; culmen gently convex, rounded or very faintly 

 ridged; gonys much shorter than maxilla from nostril, straight or 

 very faintly convex; maxillary tomium with anterior half decidedly 

 concave, the posterior half convex, the rictal ]>ortion deflected;

 broadly oval and vertical, in anterior end of nasal fossie immediately 

 behind the bulging base of the rhinotheca, almost if not quite hidden 

 by the feathering of the frontal antite. Wing (more than four times 

 as long as culmen, about three times as long as tarsus or a little 

 more), with rather short and rounded tip (])rimaries exceeding 

 secondaries by more than length of culmen) ; tenth primary minute 

 (but little if any exceeding primary coverts), very narrow, pointed, 

 rather rigid ; ninth primary nearly or quite equal to fifth, the eighth 

 and seventh longest, with sixth but little shorter. Tail nearly as long 

 as wing, much graduated, the tips of the lateral rectrices reaching 

 to about tips of longest under tail-coverts, and shorter than the 

 middle pair by nearly twice the length of culmen. Tarsus about 

 twice as long as maxilla from nostril, or slightly more, slender, the 

 anterior scutella fairly distinct; middle toe, wdth claw, about equal, 

 to tarsus or slightly longer; outer toe with claw reaching to base of 

 middle claw, the inner shorter; hallux equal to or slightly longer 

 than outer toe, much stouter, its claw about equal to or slightly 

 shorter than the digit; claws rather slender, rather strongly curved. 

 Coloration. — Plain brownish above, grayish beneath; adult male 

 with pileum dark gray, sides of head orange or orange-red, and 

 upper tail-coverts dull crimson. 



The above generic diagnosis is drawn from E. meljwda, the only

Adult male. — Pileum plain slate-gray or slate color; rest of upper 

 parts, except upper tail-coverts, plain brown (varying from deep 

 broccoli brown to nearly prouts brown or vand^^ke) ; upper tail- 

 coverts dull crimson or maroon-crimson; tail brownish black, the 

 middle pair of rectrices more slaty, or dusky brownish gray, edged 

 basally with dusky red; lores and orbits flame scarlet or saturn red.

BIKDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMEEICA. 289 



Family ALAUDID.^. 



THE LARKS. 



Terrestrial nine- or ten- primaried Latiplantar Oscines.'* 



Bill variable in shape, but usually small, conoid, usually moder- 

 ately thick or rather slender, sometimes very deep and compressed, 

 in some genera slender and much elongated ; maxillary tomium with- 

 out subterminal notch. Nostril usually narrow, oblique, in lower 

 anterior portion of nasal forsse, sometimes longitudinal, usually at 

 least partly concealed by antrorse feathering of loral antise. Rictal 

 bristles indistinct or obsolete. Wing rather long, pointed, the long- 

 est primaries much longer than secondaries (except elongated "ter- 

 tials"), the ninth, eighth, or seventh primaries longest, the tenth 

 greatly reduced in size or rudimentary, sometimes minute and con- 

 cealed ; innermost secondaries (tertials) usually elongated, some- 

 times extending to tip of longest primaries. Tail variable in relative 

 length but always much shorter than wing, nearly even, double 

 rounded, or more or less deeply emarginate ; rectrices twelve. Tar- 

 sus rather stout, variable as to relative length, latiplantar, the poste- 

 rior edge broad and rounded, the planta tarsi scutellate on both sides, 

 the scutella or segments usually alternating but sometimes nearly 

 corresponding with those of the acrotarsium; middle toe shorter than 

 tarsus, decidedly longer than lateral toes, which are nearl}' equal, 

 but the inner more or less longer than outer; claws of anterior toes 

 slightly curved, usually short, that of the hallux much longer, some- 

 times much elongated and nearly straight, occasionally much longer 

 than the digit. Head usually more or less crested (bi-crested 

 or "eared" in Otocoris). 



Coloration. — Usually streaked brownish above, whitish, streaked 

 with brown below; sometimes nearly plain brown or "isabelline" (in 

 (leserticole species), occasionally black or dusky; one genus (Otocoris) 

 with conspicuous frontal and cheek patches antl jugidar collar or 

 cresent of black. 



Nidiji cation. — Nest on ground, in open places; eggs speckled. 



Range. — Palaearctic, Ethiopian, and Indian regions; one species in 

 Australia and another (circumpolar one) in North America. 



The most characteristic feature of the Larks among other oscinine 

 families is seen in the scutellation of the tarsus. The anterior half 

 of this is covered by divided scales lapping round on the sides, but 

 instead of the two plates which go one on each side of the posterior 

 half and unite ultimately behind as an acute ridge, there is but one 

 which laps round on the sides, and is divided into scales like the 

 anterior ones, but alternating with them. The posterior edge of the 



a See Part I of this work, page 23. 

 11422— VOL 4—07 19 




290 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



tarsus is as obtuse as the anterior, instead of being very acute. 

 There is a deep separating groove on the inner side of the tarsus; 

 and there may be really but one plate di\aded transversely, the edges 

 meeting at this place. '^ 



In the elongated hind claw and lengthened tertials, general style 

 of coloration, mode of life, and manner of nesting, there is a decided 

 approximation in the Alaudidso to the Anthinae, of the family Mota- 

 cillidse; but in these the posterior edge of the tarsus is sharp and 

 undivided transversely (acutiplantar), the toes more deeply cleft, the 

 bill more slender, etc., their relations being decidedly nearer to the 

 Mniotiltidse than to the present family. 



The Larks are a strongly marked group of song birds, distinguished 

 from all other oscinine groups by their latiplantar tarsus, as described 

 above. They are terrestrial birds of small size and plain colors, 

 feeding on both grain and insects. Many species are good songsters ; 

 indeed, the Skylark (Alauda arvensis) is so especially renowned that 

 "of all birds it holds unquestionably the foremost place in our litera- 

 ture, and there is hardly a poet or poetaster who has not made it his 

 theme, to say nothing of the many writers of prose who have cele- 

 brated its qualities in passages that will be remembered so long as 

 our language lasts."'' 



The family is almost exclusively an Old World one, only one genus 

 occurring regularly in America, this represented by a single species, 

 also, Palaearctic or circumpolar, which has several congeners in Asia 

 and northern Africa. A second genus occurs in North America as 

 a straggler to Greenland and the Bermudas, the same species (the 

 Skylark) having also been introduced into the United States, and 

 become naturalized, apparently, in a few restricted areas. A closely 

 related form (Alauda arvensis peMnensis) , which represents the fore- 

 going in northeastern Asia and is only subspecifically distinct, pos- 

 sibly occurs as a straggler on the Aleutian Islands. The Old World 

 forms are numerous, embracing, according to the latest authority, 

 more than one hundred species. 



KEY TO THE AMERICAN GENERA OF ALAUDID^. 



a. Toes relatively longer, the middle one (without claw) much longer than exposed 

 culmen, the hallux longer than lateral toes; a minute spurious primary; tail shorter 

 than distance from bend of wing to end of secondaries, deeply emarginate; crown 

 with a blunt crest, but no elongated, horn-like tuft on side of occiput; plumage 

 dull brownish, conspicuously streaked on upper parts and on chest, but without 

 black or dusky areas on crown, sides of head, or chest Alauda (p. 291) 



O' The Alaudidse constitute part of Sundevall's Scvtelliplantares, and are commonly 

 mentioned as scutelliplantar Oscines, the remaining Scutelliplant'ares of Sundevall 

 consisting of the Clamatores. The Alaiidine tarsal envelope is, however, exceedingly 

 distinct in its character from the holaspidean Clamatorial type, while at the same time 

 it is equally different from that of all other Oscines in the respects pointed out.

Genus ALAUDA Linnaeus. 



Alauda Linn.^sus, Syst. Nat., ed. 10, i, 1758, 165. (Type, by elimination, A. 

 arvensis Linn.^us.) 



Brownish, profusely streaked Alaudidie with middle toe (without 

 claw) longer than exposed culmen, hallux longer than lateral toes, a 

 minute spurious primary, and deeply emarginate tail. 



Bill about half as long as head, or less, narrowly conical, com- 

 pressed, its width at frontal antia? decidedly less than its depth at same 

 point, and equal to not more than half the distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla; exposed culmen shorter than middle toe without claw, 

 nearly straight for most of its length, but more or less perceptibly 

 decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla rather sharp but not uncinate; 

 gonj^s nuich longer than mandibidar rami, straight or veiy faintly 

 convex, ascending terminally; maxillary tomium nearly straight, with- 

 out trace of subterminal notch. Nostril concealed by short feather- 

 ing of frontal antiae, this feathering semierect above the nostril (where 

 involving the upper portion of nasal fossae) , decumbent on lower por- 

 tion. Rictal bristles minute, practically obsolete, the feathers of chin 

 and decumbent feathers overhanging nostril with rather distinct, 

 though short, bristly tips. Wing long and pointed, the longest prima- 

 ries exceeding secondaries by nearly, to much more than, one-third the 

 total length of wing; ninth, eighth, eighth and ninth, or seventh, 

 eighth, and ninth, primaries largest, the tenth (outermost) rudimen- 

 tary, very minute, much shorter than primary coverts (usually much 

 less than half their length). Tail shorter than distance from bend of 

 wing to end of outermost secondaries, deeply emarginate, the rectrices 

 slightly tapering or narrowing terminally, with narrowly rounded or 

 obtusely angular tip. Tarsus decidedly longer than middle toe with 

 claw, rather stout, its scutellation holaspidean, with acrotarsial divi- 

 sions sometimes indistinct; basal phalanx of middle toe united to outer 

 toe by more than its basal half, to the inner toe by slightl}^ to deci- 

 dedly less; outer toe, without claw, reaching to second joint of mid- 

 dle toe, the inner toe slightl}^ longer; hallux longer than inner toe, 

 stouter, its claw usually much longer than the digit, slender, nearly 

 straight or slightly arched; anterior claws small, slightly curved. 



Coloration. — Above brown, everywhere streaked \\\i\\ dusky, the 

 wings and tail dusk}^, with light brown edgings; lateral rectrices partly 

 white; under parts dull whitish, tinged \ni\\ tawny brown or buffy, 




292 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



the cliest streaked with dusky. Crowii with a blunt erectile crest. 

 Sexes alike. Young spotted above instead of streaked, the feathers 

 with conspicuous terminal margins of whitish; the general color of 

 upper parts more tawny than in adults; tertials broadly margined 

 with buff, or brownish buff, surrounding a submargin of dusky brown 

 or dull blackish; chest buffy or ochraceous-buffy, more or less dis- 

 tinctly streaked or spotted with brown or dusky. 



Nidification. — Nest on ground, in grain fields, pastures, or other 

 open places, open above, composed of dried grasses, etc. Eggs (of 

 A. arvensis) dull buffy whitish to pale grayish brown, thickly speckled 

 with brown, 



Range. — Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, including Formosa 

 and Philippine Islands. (Three species, with additional subspecies; 

 one species introduced into and sparingly naturalized in northeastern 

 United States.) 



ALAUDA ARVENSIS ARVENSIS (Linn^us).a 



Adults (sexes alike) in spring and summer. — Above wood brown 

 or isabella color, everywhere (except on wings and tail) streaked 

 with blackish, the streaks broadest on crown, back, and rump, where 

 margined with deeper brown, some of the interscapulars and scapu- 

 lars with inner webs paler than the general color; lesser w4ng-co verts 

 nearly uniform wood brown or isabella color; middle coverts dusky 

 centrally, otherwise brown passing on margins into pale buffy brown 

 or dull brownish white; greater coverts with concealed portion 



a Alauda arvensis in its larger sense has a very wide range, and in different geographic 

 areas of the region which it inhabits is differentiated into several more or less distinct 

 subspecific forms. Dr. Hartert, in his Vogel der Paldarkiischen Fauna (iii, 1905, 

 244-248) recognizes seven of these geographic forms, as follows: (1) Alauda arvensis 

 arvensis Linnaeus, of western, central, and northern Europe; (2) Alauda arvensis can- 

 tarella (Bonaparte) of southern Europe; (3) Alauda arvensis cinerea (Ehmeke), of west- 

 ern Siberia, Turkestan, etc.; (4) Alauda arvensis harterti Whitaker, of northern Africa; 

 (5) Alauda arvensis -pekinensis (Swinhoe), of Kamchatka, northeastern Siberia, etc.; 

 (G) Alauda arvensis japonica (Temminck and Schlegel), of Japan; and (7) Alauda arven- 

 sis intermedia (Swinhoe), of Korea, Manchuria, and middle Siberia. In addition to 

 A. a. arvensis, which has substantial claims to a place in a work on American birds, it 

 is possible that A. a. pekinensis may also yet be included in our fauna, since a part of 

 its range is so nearly contiguous to American territory in the Aleutian Islands. The 

 characters and synonymy of this form are as follows: 



Alauda a7-vensis pekinensis (Swinhoe). — Similar to A. a. arvensis, but slightly larger 

 (especially the wing) and coloration brighter, the tawny suffusion more pronounced 

 and black spots averaging larger. 



Northeastern Asia, from Kamchatka (including Commander Islands) and north- 

 eastern Siberia to Sakhalin Island, Kuril Islands and northern Yesso, in winter to Japan 

 and northern China (Peking).

 the secondaries similarly colored but the three innermost (tertials) 

 with greater part of exposed ])ortion dusky grayish brown; primaries 

 dusky edged with pale bufTy brown or brownish buff, the outermost 

 with outer web almost entirely pale buify; middle pair of rectrices 

 dusky medially, otherwise brown with paler margins; next pair

 with most of outer web and portion of inner web next to shaft (except 

 basally) dull white, the next rectrix with outer web edged with 

 white; a broad but not sharply defined superciliary stripe of pale 

 brownish buff or dull brownish white; auricular region brown, indis- 

 tinctly streaked with darker; lores dull whitish; malar region similar 

 in color to auricular region but paler and more distinctly streaked; 

 under parts dull buffy white, strongly tinged on chest, sides and 

 flanks with tawny buff, the last two narrowly and rather indistinctly 

 streaked with darker, the first more broadly and very distinctly and 

 sharply streaked with brownish black; axillars and under wing-coverts 

 pale wood brown or grayish vinaceous; bill pale brownish buffy 

 (grayish or filaceous in life?) becoming darker or dusky on culmen; 

 iris brown; legs and feet brownish (in dried skins). 



Adults in autumn and winter. — Similar to the spring and summer 

 plumage but the general color above more tawny brown, feathers of 

 pileum, back, scapulars, and rump more or less distinctly margined 

 terminally with whitish or pale buffy,*^ and dusky streaks on chest 

 less sharply defined. 



Young. — ''Upper plumage sandy, tinged with buff, the center of 

 the feathers dark brown with a very broad edging of sandy color,

 ceous, or cinnamomeous) above, distinctly streaked only on back, 

 or entirely unstreaked; fore part of crown, elongated horn-like tufts 

 on side of occiput, loral and suborbital regions, and ])atch on chest 

 black; forehead, superciliary stripe, tliroat, and under parts of bodj'^ 

 plain whitish, or except the last (and rarely that also) light yellow; 

 lateral rectrices partly white. Adult females similar but more 

 streaked and with black areas more restricted, duller in color, or 

 broken by streaks. Young; mixed dusky and light brown above (in 

 variably relative amount) speckled or dotted with white or buffy; 

 wing-coverts margined with pale buffy; under parts whitish, the 

 chest more or less tinged with pale brown or buffy and speckled or 

 clouded v/ith dusky 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 297 



Nidification. — Nest on ground, in open places, open above, com- 

 posed of dried grass-stems, etc. Eggs (3-5) pale olive, pale buffy, 

 etc., finely (usually densely) speckled with olive-brown (rarely cinna- 

 mon-buff speckled with rusty) . 



Range. — ]\Iore open portions of North America, Europe, Asia, and 

 northern Africa; in America south to southern Mexico, reappearing 

 on highlands of Colombia. (Three or four species, with numerous 

 subspecies.) 



The seasonal and other changes of plumage in the species of this 

 genus are so marked that it is quite necessary they should be clearly 

 understood by any one attempting the identification of any one of 

 them or any of the numerous subspecific forms. In attempting such 

 determination, it is, of course, necessary to compare only specimens 

 of the same sex in the same seasonal or other special plumage; and 

 if one attempts to determine an unidentified form by comparing an 

 example in wmter plumage with another in spring or summer dress, 

 the result will prove unsatisfactory to say the least. These various 

 plumages have been so clearly described by Dr. Jonathan Dwight, jr., 

 in his important paper « on the American forms, that I reproduce his 

 descriptions here in full, rather than give new ones which could 

 scarcely differ but in phraseology: 



Males in breeding -plumage. — Back various shades of brown, the feathers darkest 

 along the shafts and edged with pinkish, reddish, or grayish, corresponding to the 

 tints of the nape, and producing a mottled or broadly streaked appearance; back of 

 head, sides of neck and nape (generally in marked contrast to the back) pinkish, 

 vinaceous, or reddish, extending to the black of the jugulum and along the sides and 

 flanks; shoulders and a band on rump usually redder than the nape; fore part of crown, 

 erectile "horns," a broad loral stripe, extending wider below the eye into the middle 

 ear-coverts and a crescentic patch on the jugulum, curving below from shoulder to 

 shoulder, uniform black; frontal band, a broad superciliary stripe, the middle of the 

 ear-coverts (often interrupted with dusky), chin, throat, and remaining lower parts 

 white, usually tinged about the head with yellow, which is brightest on the chin and 

 sometimes washes the breast; flanks obscurely streaked with dusky; tibitc like sides 

 or duller, sometimes pale yellow; wings similar in color to the back, rather darker, the 

 quills whitish-edged ; tail black, outer web of exterior feathers chiefly white, and color 

 of rump-band shading off into the pale brown of the two central feathers. Bill plum- 

 beous black, lower mandible paling from tip to base. Feet black. 



As but one moult takes place in the year (at the end of the breeding season), the 

 breeding plumage is the direct result of the wearing and fading of the autumn plumage, 

 each individual feather wearing away at the points of least resistance, chiefly the tip. 

 As the feathers of the back are darker at the base they fade least, the yellow ones fade 

 most, while the vinaceous tints of the neck are often deeper in siimnu'r than in spring, 

 when the grayish tips are longer, consequently: 



Adult males in autumn plumage difier hom breeding liirdsonly in softer i)lumage and 

 more blended colors; grayish, yellowish, or brownisli tips oliscure the whole of the 

 upper parts, producing a grayer or darker, more broadly and indistinctly streaked 

 appearance; yellowish tips obscure more or less the black areas; and dusky tips just 



a The Auk, vii, 1890, 138-158, with map. 




298 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



V)elow the black crescent produce a clouding or indistinct spotting across the breast. 

 The yellows are much brighter. 



Young of the year are usually more conspicuously sjjotted, washed with buffy across 

 the breast, and browner and darker above, with smaller bills. 



Feviales in breeding plumage. — Smaller than males; black areas more restricted and 

 less clearly defined; streaked continuously above from frontal band to rump-band, 

 lines narrowest on the head and fewest on the nape, sometimes forming a black patch 

 (rarely as distinct as in the most indistinct male) on the fore part of the crown; frontal 

 band often narrow and obscure; shoulders and ear-coverts frequently obscured with 

 dusky; otherwise similar to the male. 



Adult females in autumn plumage. — Plumage softer and colors more suffused than in 

 breeding dress, grayish, brownish, or yellowish tips obscuring the various areas of color. 

 Brownish wash and dusky spotting on the breast more or less distinct. 



Young of the year usually darker and browner above, the breast below the crescent 

 more conspicuously washed with buffy and more heavily spotted with dusky brown. 



Yoking in first plumage. — Above dusky, brownish, or buffy, conspicuously dotted 

 from bill to tail with white; wing-quills and coverts edged with buffy; below white, 

 spotted (more or less) across the breast with dusky, often on a buffy wash. This plum- 

 age is completely moulted in acquiring the autumn dress, which varies but little from 

 that of the adult. The feathers of the back are first replaced, those of the shoulders 

 next, then the wing-quills, beginning with those nearest the body, and when the spot- 

 ted plumage has nearly all disappeared, the head changing last, the black about the 

 head and then that of the jugular crescent begins to show, and the tail feathers appear 

 last of all. Bill and feet pale yellowish. 



KEY TO THE SUBSPECIES OF OTOCORIS ALPESTRIS.a 



a. Upper parts not speckled. (Adults.) 



' 6. A sharply defined patch of black covering fore part of crown and posterior part 

 of forehead, continued laterally to and involving the horn-like occipital tufts; 

 black area on side of head and black patch across chest larger, deeper black. 

 (Adult males) 

 C. Color of back more grayish, more strongly contrasted with pinkish color of 

 hindneck and occiput, more heavily or darkly streaked. 

 d. Occiput, hindneck, and lesser wing-coverts paler and more vinaceous (between 

 vinaceous-buff and buff-pink). 

 e. Larger (wing averaging more than 111 mm.''). 

 /. Throat always white ; general color above paler and grayer, with hind- 

 neck, etc., more lilaceous. (Breeding in Alaska, except coast district 

 east and south of Alaska peninsula; migrating south to Oregon, Utah, 

 Montana, etc.) Otocoris alpestris arcticola (p. 307) 



a The characters of the various subspecies, consisting almost entirely of differences 

 in measurements and relative grayness 'or redness of upper parts, depth and extent 

 of yellow of head (if present) and thus of a purely comparative nature, the construction 

 of a really useful "Key" is necessarily a matter of very great difficulty. In fact, one 

 that would be entirely satisfactory is, from the nature of the case, probably impossible, 

 and I can only hope that the one here presented may be of some assistance in the 

 proper identification of specimens. In the case of adult birds in winter, and especially 

 young birds in their first winter, identification is still more difficult, since the distinctive 

 color-characters are in these far less pronounced than in spring or summer, while on 

 account of their extensive migrations the locality often does not provide any clue. 



6 All the measurements of Otocoris in this volume, except those of total length, are 

 taken from Mr. Oberholser's paper (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xxiv, 1902, 801-884).

Similar to 0. a. praticola, but smaller, upper parts slightly grayer, 

 hindneck, lesser wing-coverts, etc., less distinctly vinaceous (more 

 grayish), back less distinctly or broadly streaked, and yellow of 

 throat usually deeper, the superciliary stripe usuall}" also more or 

 less yellowish; similar also to 0. a. diaphora but slightly smaller, 

 upper parts decidedly grayer, and hindneck much less vinaceous. 

 Adult female most like that of 0. a. praticola but decidedly smaller 

 and very much grayer (even the lesser wing-coverts scarcely if at 

 all tinged with vinaceous), and whole throat decidedly (usually deep) 

 yellow. Young similar to that of 0. a. leucolsema but darker and 

 less buffy, the general color of upper parts broccoli brown, relieved 

 by terminal dots of bufly whitish and subterminal spots, bars, or 

 streaks of dusky; much paler and grayer than that of 0. a. praticola. 

 (A frequent but not constant feature in this form is the presence of 

 more or less of pale yellow on the under parts of the body, usually 

 on the breast just below the black jugular patch, but sometimes 

 extending to the flanks, in this respect resembling 0. a. strigata of 

 the northwest coast district.)

Similar to 0. a. giraudi, but decidedly larger, back more broadly 

 streaked with dusky, and hindneck darker and more rufescent; still 

 more like 0. a. pratlcola (both in size and coloration) and sometimes 

 scarcely distinguishable," but dusky streaks of back, etc., usually 

 broader and blacker, and superciliary stripe usiially yellow; similar 

 also to 0. a. leucolscma but slightly smaller and much darker, with 

 ground color of upper j)arts grayer; differing from 0. a. strigata in 

 being decidedl}" larger, much grayer above, with streaks narrower and 

 dusky instead of black, and (usually) without yellow on under parts. 

 Adult female similar to that of 0. a. praticola but slightly grayer and 

 darker; sides of breast darker and conspicuously streaked with dusky, 

 and size slightly smaller. Young "not with certainty distinguishable 

 from specimens of praticola of the same age."'' (Intermediate 

 between 0. a. leucolaema and 0. a. strigata.)

Breeding in northwestern semiarid districts of the United States, 

 from northwestern Nevada (along base of Sierra Nevada) and north- 

 eastern California (Placer, Sierra Nevada, Plumas, Lassen, Modoc, 

 Shasta, and Siskiyou counties) tlii'ough Oregon and Washington east 



« This form is, like the Penthestes of nearly the same geographic area, another 

 example of the very close similarity of intermediates between a darker and a paler 

 form to one belonging to a widely separated geographic area. In the present case, 

 0. a. merrilli is intermediate in coloration between 0. a. strigata and 0. a. leuco- 

 lama, the former being darker, the latter paler; and intermediates between 0. a. 

 merrilli and 0. a. leucolaema are so precisely similar to 0. a. praticola of the Atlantic 

 States that if mixed with a series of the latter they probably could not be separated 

 without reference to the labels. On the summit of the Sierra Nevada, about Lake 

 Tahoe, birds of this genus have been taken which, while apparently 0. a. strigata 

 seem to be, according to Mr. Oberholser's views (Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus.. xxiv. 1902, 

 835, 836), merely intermediates between 0. a. merrilli and 0. a. rubea — another exam- 

 ple of the same sort of mimicry. (For remarks concerning the case of Penthestes atri- 

 capillus from the same region see Part III, p. 398.)

oAs Mr. Oberholser remarks, " that insMZans should have been differentiated toward 

 strigata is ... an interesting case of parallel development." Mr. Oberholser also 

 says that "by reason of the evident approach to actia from island to island, which 

 would in a continental distribution culminate in complete inosculation, and the notice- 

 able resemblance to strigata, it seems advisable to consider insulaiis as a subspecies in 

 spite of its island habitat" — a view with which my own entirely agrees.

e For definitions of these terms see Huxley, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867. 415-472. 



/ See Part I, p. 18, of the present work. The several modifications of the tarsal 

 envelope in the present group may be described as follows: 



I. Exaspidean. — The anterior envelope (acrotarsium) extends entirely across the 

 outer side of the tarsus and around the posterior side, sometimes meeting the starting 

 point on posterior portion of inner side, the two edges usually separated by a narrow 

 strip or groove of smooth or nonscutellate membrane. 



IL Endaspidean. — The above arrangement (exaspidean) reversed, the acrotarsium 

 extending to and around the tarsus from the inner side, the narrow plantar space being 

 thus external instead of internal. 



III. Pyenaspidean. — The broad plantar space on posterior side of tarsus broken up 

 into numerous small irregular or roundish scutella or granules. 



IV. Holaspidean. — The broad plantar space occupied by a single series of broad, 

 more or less quadrate or rectangular scutella. 



V. Taxaspidean. — The broad plantar space occupied by two or, rarely, three series 

 of smaller, quadrate, rectangular, or hexagonal scutella. 



These several types of tarsal scutellation are, in the main, well defined; but some- 

 times the arrangement is more or less intermediate; some Tyrannidae. for example, 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 329 



diagnosis than that given above is scarcely practicable. Indeed, our 

 knowledge of their internal structure is limited to so few of the forms 

 that the extent to which our present ideas of the classification of the 

 group may require modification after the anatomy of additional 

 genera has been studied is a matter of great imcertainty; in fact it is 

 not at all improbable that many changes in the limitations and com- 

 position of the family groups may be necessary. The anacromy- 

 odous syrmx and homoeomerous tliigh artery of many genera of 

 Tyrannidae as well as the catacromyodous syrinx and heteromerous 

 thigh artery of many genera of Piprid^ and Cotingidse are, for exam- 

 ple, merely assumed, and there may be many exceptions to these sup- 

 posedly diagnostic characters of the groups in question. Certainly 

 some genera referred to the Cotingidse can be separated, so far as 

 external features admit, from the TjTannidse only by their non- 

 exaspidean tarsi; but at the same time the character of the tarsal 

 envelope is hardly more different than it is from that of certain other 

 menibers of the Cotingidap. In the absence, therefore, of Ivnowledge 

 as to the insertion of the vocal muscles and other anatomical char- 

 acters of certain genera w^e must necessarily for the present be guided 

 largely by external characters, and therefore the classification indi- 

 cated in the following key to the famiHes must be regarded as purely 

 tentative. 



The Mesomyodi are cliiefly American and mostly Neotropical, only 

 three families (Xenicidge, Pliilepittidse, and Pittidae) occurring m the 

 Eastern Plemisphere. Notwithstanding the difference in structure of 

 their vocal organs many species (notably among the FormicariidaB) 

 are songsters of considerable merit. 



have the tarsal envelope for its greater part typically exaspidean, but on the upper 

 portion the acrotarsium extends only part way across the outer side, where there may 

 1)0 either distinct posterior series of scutella or small roundish or oval scutella extend- 

 ing for a short distance below the heel joint, or this space may be entirely nonscutellate. 

 The two edges of the acrotarsium may be in actual contact for a greater or less portion 

 of the length of the tarsus, or there may be a space of greater or less width between; 

 this space being usually nonscutellate, but sometimes partly occupied by small roimd- 

 ish scutella, the tarsus then being semi-pycnaspidean. Sometimes the scutella are 

 fused, the smooth (ocreate or ' 'booted '' ) tarsal covering then superficially resembling 

 that of certain Oscines; l)ut careful comparison will show a radical difference in the 

 forv) of the post(>rior side of the tarsus, which in all Oscines except tlie Alaudidic (in 

 which the tarsus is holaspidean) has the posterior margin contracted into a sharp or 

 narrow lidge or edge.

Since the above was written I have seen the following l^rief refer- 

 ence to a paper (apparently not yet published) on the classification 

 of the present group by Mr. W. P. Pycraft, F. Z. S. According to 

 this notice Mr. Pycraft describes the ' 'Tracheophone Passeres ' ' as 

 a group differing from all the remaining Passeres in the formation 

 of the syrinx, which is tracheal — instead of tracheo-bronchial — and 

 peculiar among syringes of the tracheal type in the develo])ment of 

 a cartilaginous j^illar for the insertion of the intrinsic muscles. Tlie 

 group is divisible into three sections — (a) having holorhinal nares 

 and a single-notched sternum, (h) with schizorhinal nares and a 

 single-notched sternum, and (c) with holorhinal nares and a double- 

 notched sternum. 



He proposetl to make the Tracheophone Passeres one of four great 

 divisions of the Passerine stem. Tlie most primitive of the divisions 

 would contain the Euryhiemidae, Cotingidjp, and Philepitta. The 

 second woidd be represented by the Tracheophonse, the third by the 

 TyrannidiB and Pittida% and the fourth by the rest of the Passeres. 



Family OXYRUNCID/E. 



THE SHARP-BILLS. 



Sharp-billed Mesomyodian birds with syrinx broncho-tracheal 

 (haploophone), syringeal muscles anacromyodous, tarsal envelope 

 exaspidean, outer toe nearly as long as middle toe, and basal phalanx 

 of middle toe adherent for more than half its length to inner toe. 



The above brief diagnosis is sufficient for charptcterizing this re- 

 markable family, which may be readily distinguished from other 

 Mesomyodian groups by the combination of shar])-])ointe(i, wedge- 

 shaped bill and exaspidean tarsi. A supposed diagnostic character in 

 the alleged serration of the outermost primary is really not worth 

 consideration, the serration being so faint as to be practicalh^ non- 

 existent. 



The Oxyrimcida> comprise, so far as known, a single genus (Oxy- 

 runcus Temminck), which contains three forms, apparently mere 

 geographic variations of a single species, which ranges from Costa 

 Rica to southeastern Brazil. 



The relationships of the form are not satisfactorily determined, 

 but apparently the Tyrannidse are not remotely allied.

b I have not seen a specimen actually determined as a male, but Messrs. Salvin and 

 Godman state that the female differs from the male only in the absence or less devel- 

 opment of the serration along the edge of the outermost primary. This serration being 

 very obvious in a specimen sexed by the collector as a female, I conclude that the 

 supposed distinction between the sexes is not to be entirely relied on.

Family TYRANNID.E. 



THE TYRANT FLYCATCHERS. 



Mesomyodian Passeres with the syrinx broncho-tracheal (haploo- 

 phone), syringeal muscles anacromyodous (the vocal muscles 

 inserted on the dorsal end of the bronchial semirings), tarsal envelope 

 exaspidean, or quasi-exaspidean, middle toe united to outer toe for 

 not more (usually decidedly less) than its basal phalanx'' and to 

 inner toe for less than its basal phalanx, with tip of maxilla more or 

 less uncinate, and with nostrils not distinctly, if at all, operculate (if 

 overhung by integument, this membraneous, not corneous). 



Primaries obviously ten, the outermost usually longer than second- 

 aries, though sometimes (in genera Colopteryx, Atalotriccus , and 

 PTiseotnccus^) three or more outer primaries are conspicuously 

 reduced in size. Rectrices twelve, usually nearh' equal in length, 

 but sometimes the lateral, more rarely the middle, pair conspicuously 

 elongated. Bill extremely variable as to shape and relative size, but 

 always with tip of maxilla more or less uncinate; usually the bill is 

 more or less broad and depressed (more or less broadly triangular in 

 vertical profile), with culmen distinctly ridged, sometimes excessively 



o The specimen described had already assumed a considerable portion of the adult 

 plumage, and apparently at first the whole upper parts except remiges and rectrices 

 are pale yellowish flecked or clouded with pale brown.

broad; more rarely it is stout-terete or almost subulate. Rictal 

 bristles usually well developed, sometimes excessively so, extending 

 beyond tip of bill when pressed forward. Nostril usually small and 

 roundish or oval, rarely with obvious superior operculum, usually 

 partly concealed by antrorse or semierect bristly feathers of the 

 latero-frontal antise. Tarsus extremely variable as to relative length, 

 in some genera of terrestrial habits (peculiar to the treeless districts 

 of southern South America) very long and slender (twice as long as 

 middle toe without claw) ; in other genera (strictly arboreal) decidedly 

 shorter than the middle toe with claw. Tarsal envelope ultra-exas- 

 pidean to semi-pycnaspidean, usually typically exaspidean ; the acro- 

 tarsium extending on outer side to or around the posterior side of the 

 tarsus, the two edges often meeting on the inner side, but usually sep- 

 arated by a narrow (or very rarely rather broad) strip or groove of non- 

 scutellate membrane. " Middle toe usually united to outer toe for about 

 half but in several genera for the whole of its basal phalanx, in two 

 genera (RliyncJwcyclus and Terenotriccus) with at least the basal half of 

 the second phalanx thus united, and usually adherent to inner toe for less 

 than half, sometimes nearly the whole, of its basal phalanx; lateral toes 

 always unequal in length, the outer more or less longer than the inner, 

 reaching (without claw) to about the middle of the subterminal 

 phalanx of the middle toe, never to the end of the latter; hallux about 



a There are, in fact, many types or modifications of the exaspidean tarsus in this 

 group, though the extreme variations are connected by structures intermediate in 

 every degree. In a majority of the genera the acrotarsium completely incloses the 

 tarsus, at least for part of its length, the two edges being in actual contact for a greater 

 or less distance. The opposite extreme is shown, so far as I have been able to ascertain, 

 by a single species, Myiodynastes audax, which, at least in the specimen examined, is 

 separated entirely by a space 1 mm. wide at its narrowest point, the outer portion of 

 the acrotarsium extending beyond the posterior margin of the outer side of the tarsus. 

 The plantar space is essentially nonscutellate, but the lower portion shows, on close 

 examination, indications of small scutella. In this case the tarsal envelope may be 

 said to be semi-pycnaspidean, other species of the same genus (M. solitarius, M. 

 luteiventris . M. bairdi. and M. chrysocephalus) having truly exaspidean tarsi. 



In some of the genera which have the two edges of the acrotarsium actually meeting 

 on the inner side the usual acrotarsial segments or scutella are obsolete, the tarsus being 

 "booted" as in certain Oscines, examples being the genera. Perissotriccus, Platyrhin- 

 chus, Craspedoprion, Myiobius (as restricted by me), and some species of Mionectes; 

 other genera showing nearly the same condition, at least in some of the species. Cni- 

 podectes also has a booted tarsus, but the edges of the acrotarsium are separated by a 

 membraneous interval. Unfortunately, these variations in the tarsal envelope do not 

 seem to be correlated with variations in the degree of cohesion between the anterior 

 toes, form of bill, or other external characters, nor do they conform in all cases to in- 

 dubitable relationships; consequently they have disappointed me in the hope that 

 they might greatly simplify the classification of the group, for they seem of little value 

 l)eyond the definition of genera (even sometimes failing here!) or minor supergeneric 

 groups; indeed, it has been found that each of them is more or less variable within what 

 appear to be proper generic limits. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 337 



as long as outer toe but much stouter; claws usually moderately 

 developed or rather small, moderately to strongly curved, acute, that 

 of the hallux, however, sometimes as long as or longer than the digit. 



The above diagnosis, while by no means complete, is quite sufficient 

 to enable one to recognize a member of this extensive and exceed- 

 ingly varied family. The more typical Tyrannidse, especially the 

 smaller North and Middle American species, resemble, superficially, 

 the true Flycatchers (family Muscicapida) of the Old World, both 

 in general appearance and in habits; but the latter are true Oscines, 

 more nearly related to the Thrushes than to any other group of birds. 

 In South America, where the Tyrannidge are most numerous and 

 deversified, remarkable teleological reproductions or mimicries of 

 other oscinine groups have been developed. Some are similar 

 in general appearance and habits to the Kinglets (Regulinae) and 

 Titmice (Paridse); others are terrestrial and closely resemble Larks, 

 Stone-chats, "Wagtails, or Pipits; again, there are swallow-like, aerial 

 forms with deeply forficate tails; others strikingly Tody-like in appear- 

 ance; some closely resemble the Thrush-like genus Myadestes, others 

 recall Vireos; in fact there are few oscinine t^'pes which are not 

 more or less closely imitated in the group. 



More than five hundred and fifty species and subspecies of Tyran- 

 nidae are known, referable to more than eighty genera; and, as Doctor 

 Sclater remarks," " many more no doubt remain to be discovered, 

 as the remote portions of South America come to be investigated." 



Probably no other group of birds is more difficult to study; for, 

 among tlie very large number of species there are, in contrast with 

 the CotingidiB, comparatively few highly differentiated forms, 

 much the greater number being birds of dull coloration, with very 

 slightly modified structural characters; and even when the latter 

 appear distinct enough to form the basis of supergeneric subdivi- 

 sions of the family it is found on examination of others that, with 

 a few exceptions, the most extreme types grade almost imperceptibly 

 one into another. It is by no means unlikely tliat, as Doctor Sclater 

 has said, "future anatomical study on the lines pursued b}' Garrod 

 and Forbes may eventually succeed in giving us a better system 

 than anything that can be obtained from the study of the dried 

 skins;" and I am also of the opinion tliat such study will not only 

 resvdt in a satisfactory arrangement of the genera in accordance 

 with their co-relationships but will develop the necessity of dividing 

 the group into two or more, one of wliich' may include certain genera

now referred to the Cotingidse solely on account of the different 

 character of the tarsal envelope." 



In order to get as clear an understanding as practicable of the classi- 

 fication of the group, all the genera available^ to me have been 

 carefully compared. jSlany days were devoted to an attempt to 

 construct a "key" to all the genera in hand, but it finally became 

 evident that the task would require far more time for its completion 

 than could be allowed, and therefore it became necessary to restrict 

 the key to those genera belonging to the geographic field of the 

 present work, together with a few extralimital ones included for 

 the purpose of comparison. Even with this elimination of half the 

 genera the task has proven exceedingly difficult and the results far 

 from satisfactory, although it is believed that some improvement 

 has been made over the "purely provisional" arrangement in the 

 "Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum,"'^ in which the so-called 

 subfamilies are without question purely artificial and the allocation 

 of certain genera obviousl}- ^^Tong.'^ The subject has called forth a 

 very pertinent and interesting paper from Doctor von Ihering,^ in 

 which a partial reconstruction of Doctor Sclater's "Subfamilies," 

 based chiefly on biological facts, is shoAvn to be necessary, the pro- 

 posed changes being as follows: 



(1) The Tseniopterina^ restricted by elimination of the genera 

 Sayornis, Sisopijgis, and, probably, Machetornis. 



(2) The Platyrhynchinffi divided into two grou])s, Ii^uscarthmina^ 

 and Serpophaginse. 



a The general Lathria, Lipangus, Attila, Hylonax, Sirystes, Idiotriccus, Tyrannulus, 

 Microtriccus, etc. It is true that the Cotingidaj are supposed to be catacromyodous, 

 that is, have the vocal muscles inserted on the ventral instead of the dorsal end of the 

 bronchial semirings; but it is equally true that there are many genera (including those 

 just mentioned) in both the Tyrannidse and Cotingidse, as now understood, of which 

 the character of the insertion of the vocal muscles is unknown. (See remarks under 

 Mesomyodi, on p. 329.) 



b The only genera not examined are the following: Ochlhornis Sclater, Ceratotriccus 

 Cabanis, Pseiidotrkcus Taczanowski and Berlepsch, Leptotriccus Cabanis and Heine, 

 Pseiidomyobius Salvadori and Festa, Planchesia Bonaparte, Taeniotriccus Berlepsch 

 and Hartert, Phaeomyias Berlepsch, and Acrochordopus Berlepsch and Hellmayr.

(3) The Elaininse restricted by elimination of the genera Rhynclio- 

 cyclus, Legatus, Myiozetetes, Conopias, Pitangus, Sirystes, and 

 Myiodynastes, which, except the first (referred to Euscarthininie), 

 should constitute a "subfamily" Pitanginir, morphologically inter- 

 mediate between the Elainin;i> and Tyrannin;r, but which perhaps 

 should be united with the latter. 



These modifications in the arrangement of the Tyrannidse proposed 

 by Doctor Von Ihering are in my opinion entirely justifiable, but I 

 am convinced that they are but a step toward further changes which 

 are necessary before a correct exposition of the phylogeny of the 

 group can be made; and, while not prepared to forecast these with 

 any degree of certainty, will express my belief that the genera Agri- 

 ornis and Muscisaxicola are each quite sui generis and are not as 

 closely related to Tsenioptera as the latter is to typical Tyrannidse; 

 and that several genera do not belong to the Tyrannidas at all, but 

 must be transferred to other groups, none of them possessing the 

 exaspidean tarsal envelope, the only external character, except that of 

 less pronounced syndactylism (very variable within the group), which 

 can be said to be really diagnostic of the family. These are (1) 

 Lawrencia, which, having acutiplantar tarsi, is a member of the 

 Oscines;" (2) Stigmatura,^ (3) Hapalocercus,'^ and (4) Hahrura,^ 



aLawrencia has ten obvious primaries, the tenth being about half as long as the 

 ninth; the basal phalanx of the middle toe is completely united to the outer toe and 

 almost wholy adherent to the inner toe, thus agreeing, as in the wing-structure, with 

 the Vireonidse, where thegenus proljal)ly l>elongs, though differing from other vireonine 

 genera in its depressed and broadly triangular bill. 



bSligmatura resembles in general form the formicarian genus Formicivora and 

 possibly belongs to the same family. 



c Hapalocercus is also possibly formicariine in its ailinities. One species has l>oen 

 referred to it which has the typical tyrannine exaspidean tarsi and therefore certainly 

 is not congeneric. This is Aleclrurvs flaviventris D'Orbigny and Lafresnaye, type of 

 the genus Myiosyvipotes Reichonbach (Av. Syst. Nat., 1850, pi. G5), and therefore t(j 

 be known as Myiosyvipotes flaviventris. I have not seen //. fulviceps nor H. acuti- 

 pennis and therefore can not say whether they are congeneric with //. melacoryphus 

 or not; but the former doubtless is, since its very near relative, //. pauliis Bangs, is a 

 true Hapalocercus. 



<*The tarsal envelope of Habrura, while less typically taxaspidean than tliat of 

 Hapalocercus, nevertheless conforms to the same type and is by no means exaspidean. 

 The inner side of the planta tarsi consists of a single continuous series of well-defined 

 quadrate scutella; but on the outer side the acrotarsium extends quite to the posterior 

 edge of the tarsus except for the upper third, where three or four rather large and very 

 distinct longitudinal scutella occupy approximately the posterior half. This last 

 character is seen in many typical Tyrannid;v, but in none of the latter is then^ even 

 any indication of the well-defined and continuous series of qua,drate scutella along 

 the posterior half of the inner side of the tarsus. The nostrils in Habrura are quite 

 different from those of Hapalocercus, roundish and nonoperculate, while in the latter 

 they are more longitudinal, relatively larger, and overhung by a rather broad membrane- 

 ous operculum. The proper ])osition for these two genera is a question which I am 

 not able to decide, but woidd suggest that Hapalocercus may be a member of the 

 Formicariida?, while Habrura might not be out of place in the Cotingidaj.

 dean tarsi; (6) Culicivora ,^ which has non-exaspidean tarsi and only 

 ten rectrices ; (7) Sirystes, which also has holaspidean tarsi and belongs 

 very close to Lipangus, among the Cotingidse, where I have placed it; 

 (8) " Pogonotriccus" zeledoni,'^ which, -possessing ultra-pycnaspidean 

 tarsi, must be transferred to the Cotingidaj; (9) Elainopsis (type 

 ElaineaelegansVelzelnJiilO) Tyrannulus, and (11) Microtriccus {type 

 Tyrannulus seinijlavus Sclater and Salvin), which have essentially 

 pycnaspidean tarsi, and therefore can not belong to the Tyrannidse 

 as here defined, and (12) Myiarclius validus'^ Cabanis, which has 

 holaspidean tarsi and is apparently not distantly related to the 

 Cotinginc genus Attila. Possibly additional removals should be 

 made of genera which I have not been able to examine or from species 

 not available, it being a very obvious fact that comparatively few 

 of the genera as currently understood are really homogeneous or 

 natural groups, having been segregated as alleged genera more by 

 superficial examination than close attention to structural details.

a. Tail not forficate (if forked, the lateral rectrices less than twice as long as middle 

 pair). 

 h. Middle pair of rectrices elongated, much reduced in width along middle portion. 



Copurus (p. 349) 

 hh. Middle pair of rectrices not elongated. 

 c. Exposed culmen more than one-fourth as long as wing; a conspicuous trans- 

 versely fan-shaped crest of yellow, orange, or red, tipped with lilack and steel 



blue or metallic violet Onychorhynchus (p. 352) 



cc. Exposed culmen less than one-fourth as long as wing; no fan-shaped crest (if 

 crested the crest not colored as above). 



cMuscigralla is a very peculiar looking form, the appearance of which does not in the 

 least suggest any relationship to the Tyrannidse, while its holaspidean tarsi certainly 

 exclude it from that family. It probably belongs to the Formicariidse. 



''The genus Culicivora Swainson also is almost certainly not a member of the Tyran- 

 nidse, since it has non-exaspidean tarsi and only ten rectrices. The tarsal envelope at 

 lirst sight appears to be exaspidean; but, while the acrotarsium entirely crosses the 

 outer side of the tarsus and occupies the greater part of the inner side, there is inter- 

 posed, between the two edges, a continuous series of very distinct lozenge-shaped 

 scutella. The style of coloration (conspicuously streaked above) is different from 

 that of any true Tyrannine form and recalls that of some of the SjTiallaxinpe 

 (Furnariidse). 



cTruo Pogonotriccus I have not seen, but F. plnmbeiceps Lawrence (which Von 

 Berlepsch places, I think properly, in Tyranniscus) has typically exaspidean tarsi. 

 P. zelcdoni I have been obliged to make the type of a new genus. Idiotrimis, Avhich, on 

 account of its pycanspidean tarsi, I refer to the Cotingidae. 



d" Myiarchus" ralidus I have placed under Cotingidaj in the monotypic genus 

 Hylonax.

d. Very small forms (wing not more, usually much less, than 62 mm.), with bill 

 norrowly triangular or subspatulate, its width at frontal antise much less 

 than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla, exposed culmon longer than

 toe, and tail less than seven-eighths as long as wing."

sometimes less than one-fifth as long as wing, narrower and more ' 



tapering terminally; pileum crested. 



j. Feathers of crest blended, unicolored (whole pileum rufous); 



exposed culmen much more than one-fifth as long as wing; 



under parts, except throat, bright yellow, the latter not 



streaked Poecilotriccus (extralimital) b 



jj. Feathers of crest distinctly outlined, bicolored (black, mar- 

 gined with gray or tipped with rufous or tawny); exposed 

 culmen not much if any more than one-fifth as long as wing; 

 under parts of body very pale yellow or whitish, the throat 



streaked Lophotriccus (p. 369) 



hh. Bill smaller, the exposed culmen but little if any longer than mid- 

 dle toe with claw Orchilus (extralimital) c 



gg. Three or four outer primaries greatly reduced in size, the eighth 

 shorter than first. 



a The only genera of Tyrannidse belonging to the geographic field of this work pos- 

 sessing all but one of the above combination of characters are Placostomus and Platy- 

 triccus, which have the lull excessively broad (its width at frontal antiae much greater 

 than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla) and Nesotriccus, which has the tail more 

 than seven-eighths as long as the wing. 



bPoedlotriccus Berlepsch, Journ. fiir Orn., July and Oct., 1884, 298, footnote. (Type, 

 Todirostrum lenzi Berlepsch.) I am not sure that the species upon which the charac- 

 ters given above are based is really P. lenzi, since it does not agree with Doctor Sclater's 

 description nor indeed any other described in vol. xiv of the "Catalogue of Birds in the 

 British Museum." It is evidently at least closely related to both P. lenzi and P. rufi- 

 gene, but apparently differs from both in having a broad and very distinct band of 

 dusky across the chest, separating the white of the lower throat from the yellow of the 

 breast.

 nearly straight for most of its length, gradually but decidedly decurved 

 terminally, the tij) of maxilla fineh^ uncinate; gonys not longer (some- 

 times shorter) than mandibular rami, slightly but distinctly convex. 

 Nostril large, nearly circular, occupying anterior end of nasal fossae. 

 Rictal bristles obvious, but small; bristly tips of frontal feathers and 

 those of chin not conspicuous. Wing rather large, with longest prima- 

 ries exceeding secondaries by more than length of tarsus; ninth, eighth,

 or decidedly shorter (C. leuconotus), even; the rectrices broad, but the 

 middle pair elongated (excessively so in adult males), very narrow, 

 broadest terminally and constricted near middle portion where the 

 webs almost disappear. Tarsus stout, as long as middle toe with 

 claw {C. leuconotus) or slightly longer {C. colonus), its scutellation 

 typically exaspidean, with the two edges of the acrotarsium in contact 

 on lower posterior portion of the tarsus (at least in C. leuconotus), 

 the transverse segments distinct; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly 

 imited to outer toe, about half adherent to inner toe; lateral toes 

 equal in length in C. leuconotus, the outer slightly longer than inner in

 Triccus Cabanis, in Tschudi's Fauna Peruana, Aves, 1846, 164. (Type, Todus 



cinereus Linnaeus.) 



Very small Tyrannida^ (wing about 47-51 mm.) with bill nearly 

 to quite as long as head, subspatulate, its width at anterior end of 

 nostrils at least twice its depth at same point and equal to decidedly 

 less than half (sometimes less than one-third) the length of exposed 

 culmen; exposed culmen a little longer than middle toe, with claw 

 (except in T. ficJiistnceiceps), but much shorter than tarsus, distinctly 

 ridged, nearly if not quite straight to near tip, where rather abruptly 

 decurved, the tip of maxilla minutely imcinate; gonys decidedly 

 longer than mandibular rami; lateral outlines of l)ill nearly straight 

 for most of their length, but decided 1}" convex and strongly con- 

 vergent terminally. Nostril mostly, sometimes wholly, exposed, 

 narrow^, longitudinal, overhung by very broad membrane. Rictal 

 l)ristles well developed; feathers of chin and frontal antias with dis- 

 tinct ])ristly points (except in T. cinereMin). Wing moderate, much 

 roiuided; seventh, sixth and seventh, or seventh and eighth primaries 

 longest, the tenth (outermost) not longer (usually shorter) than first 

 (in T. scJiistaceiceps much shorter than secondaries) ; longest primary 

 exceeding secondaries by less than length of middle toe without claw. 

 Tail two-thirds to about five-sixths as long as wing, more or less 

 strongly rounded, or (in T. schistaceice/ps) even, the rectrices nar- 

 row (relatively broader in T. schistaceiceps). Tarsus nearly twice as 

 long as middle toe without claw (in T. nigriceps and T. guttatum), to 

 more than twice as long (in T. cinereum, T. signotum, and T. f^cMs- 

 taceiceps), slender, with acrotarsial divisions more or less distinct; 

 basal phalanx of middle toe united for entire length to outer toe, for 

 more than half its length to inner toe (in T. signatum the cohesion 

 involving almost whole of basal phalanx of middle toe on inner side 

 and part of second phalanx on outer side) ; outer toe, without claw, 

 reaching to beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, 

 the inner toe decidedly shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe, its 

 claw decidedly shorter than the digit; all the claws moderatel}^ 

 curved, sliarj), compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive-green, the pileiun and hind neck black 

 or slate color; wings and tail blackish with olive-green or yellowish 

 edgings, the former sometimes with two yellow bands, occasionall}" 

 with chestnut on carpal region; sometimes the upper parts mostly 

 black; under parts yellow, with or without black streaks on chest, the

throat sometimes wliite (in one species, T. scJiistaceiceps, the throat 

 streaked wliite and gray, the chest nearly uniform pale gray, the 

 posterior under parts very pale yellow); in some species a yellow 

 superciliary stripe or supraloral spot. Sexes alike. 



Nidijication. — Nest (of T. nigriceps) attached to near extremity of 

 branch overhanging water, composed of dried grasses, etc., and 

 resembling in appearance a bunch of enlodged drift ; entrance a small 

 opening in one side. Eggs immaculate white or with a very few pale 

 ochreous-buff spots.** 



Range. — Southern Mexico to southern Peru and southwestern 

 Brazil. (About fifteen species.) 



I exclude fi'om this genus Todirostrum rujigene ^ Sclater and Salvin, 

 T. lenzi " Berlepsch, and T. ruficeps Kaup '\ on account of their bushy 

 crest, much shorter outer primaries, smaller, narrower, and more taper- 

 ing bill, and very different style of coloration. They constitute the genus 

 Poeciloiriccus ^ Berlepsch (type T. lenzi), to which possibly should be 

 referred T. capitale^ Sclater, a species which I have not seen, and wliich 

 has the "crown rufous." Count von Berlepsch suggests, however, 

 that this may be the female of T. picatum ^ Sclater ( also not seen by 

 me) the male of which has the whole pileum and most of other upper 

 parts black, which if really the case may necessitate a slight modifica- 

 tion of the color characters as given above, provided, of course, T. 

 picatum is a true Todirostrum. Even after eliminating the species 

 referred to Poecilotriccus the group is still a heterogeneous one, and 

 probably will require further subdivision, but before this is attempted 

 all the known species should be examined. Of those seen by me only 

 T. signatum agrees with the type species ( T. cinereum) in the form of 

 the bill, the other three having the bill much broader, with the lateral

outlines converging more rapidly and more gradually terminally, the 

 vertical profile being thus more triangular or less spatulate. In T. 

 schistaceiceps alone the exposed culmen is shorter than the middle toe 

 with claw, the outermost primary much shorter than the secondaries, 

 and the tail even, with relatively broad rectrices ; and the coloration of 

 this species is very different, closely resembling that of Oncostoma 

 cinereigulare . T. nigriceps is aberrant in its very broad bill (its 

 width at frontal antiae equal to half the length of exposed culmen) 

 and very short tail ( only two-thirds as long as wing) , with very narrow 

 rectrices.

After very careful examination and comparison of a series of 108 adults of this species 

 I am not able to confirm all the characters of this form, as given by Mr. Bangs, especially 

 the alleged difference in intensity of the yellow on the underparts, which to me seems, 

 if any different, brighter in South American than in Mexican and Central American 

 skins, instead of the reverse. The difference in coloration of the upper i)arts is also by 

 no means contsant, but there seems to be an average difference suilicient to sei^arate 

 the two series. The birds from southwestern Brazil (Mattogrosso) are, however, easily 

 separated by the charact(>rs given in tlie key on page 363.

Very small Tyi-annidae (wing not more than 55 mm.) Avitli a very 

 conspicuous crest of broad, bicolored feathers, and with outermost 

 primaries not abnormally reduced, the eighth equal to or longer than 

 hfth, the otitermost (tenth) at least three-fourths as long as the 

 longest. 



Bill more than half as long as head, moderately depressed, rather 

 narrow, its width at anterior end of nostrils eqiuil to about half the 

 distance from nostril to tip of maxilla and less than twice its depth at 

 same ])oint; exposed culmen slightly shorter than middle toe with 

 claw, about one-fifth as long as wing (L. spicifer) or decidedly less (L.

squamxcristatus) , distinctly ridged, nearly straight to near tip, where 

 gradually decurved, the tip of maxilla very minutely uncinate; gonys 

 longer than mandibular rami, very faintly convex; maxillary tomium 

 straight, minutely notched subterminally. Nostril exposed, longitu- 

 dmally narrowly elliptical, overhung by broad membrane. Rictal 

 bristles well developed, reaching more than halfway to tip of bill; 

 feathers of chiil" and frontal antife with distinct bristly tips, those of 

 the latter extending across and much beyond nostrils. Wing mod- 

 erate or rather large, rounded; sixth and seventh primaries longest, 

 the eight and fifth, successively, but little shorter, the ninth about 

 equal to fourth, the tenth (outermost) shorter than first; longest 

 primary exceeding secondaries by less than length of exposed culmen. 

 Tarsus slender, about two-sevenths to nearly one-third as long as 

 wing, the divisions of the acrotarsium obvious on close inspection, but 

 very indistinct; middle toe, without claw, about half as long as tarsus, 

 its basal phalanx wholly united to outer toe, united for most of its 

 length to inner toe; outer toe, without claw, reaching nearly to termi- 

 nal joint of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter, barely reach- 

 ing to middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe; hallux slightly 

 longer than inner toe, its claw shorter than the digit; all the claws 

 moderately curved, sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Plain olive-green above, the wings dusky with light 



olive-green edgings, the tips of middle and greater coverts and edges 



' of tertials 3-ellowish; crest black, the feathers margined with gray or 



tipped with cinnamon or rufous; under parts pale yellow posteriorly, 



streaked grayish and yellowish white anteriorly.

 Colopterits pilaris Cabanis. ) 



Very small Tyrannidoe (wing about 40-43 mm.) similar to Colop- 

 teryx^ in reduction of outermost primaries, but diflferino; in ab.sence 

 of crest, in having four instead of three primaries reduced in size, 

 the reduction excessive and the shape of these reduced primaries very 

 different, being narrow and acuminate instead of normal. 



Bill more than half as long as head, depressed, rather narrow, sub- 

 spatulate, its width at nostrils equal to about half the distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla and decidedly but not conspicuously greater 

 than its depth at same point; exposed culmen more than half as long 

 as tarsus, about one-fourth as long as wing, sharply ridged, nearly 

 straight or very faintly convex to near tip, where slightly decurved, 

 the tip of maxilla very minutely uncinate; gonys longer than man- 

 dibular rami, very faintl}^ convex; maxillary tomium nearly straight, 

 minutely notched subterminally; lateral outlines of bill straight 

 and nearly parallel for more than basal half, then decidedly con- 

 vex and rapidly convergent to the tip of maxilla. Nostril exposed, 

 rather large, longitudinally oval or broadly elliptical, overhimg b}^ 

 broad membrane. Rictal bristles well developed, reaching more 

 than halfway to tip of bill; feathers of chin and frontal antine with 

 conspicuous bristly tips, those of the latter extending across and 

 much beyond nostrils. Wing short and excessively rounded, with 

 four outermost primaries excessively reduced in size, decreasing in 

 size from the tenth (outermost) to the seventh, very narrow, with 

 subacuminate and slightly curved tip; the longest of these (outer- 

 most) in adidt male only half as long as longest primary; third and 

 foui'th ]irimaries longest, second slightly shorter, first and fifth equal, 

 the sixth much shorter than secondaries. Tail nearly as long as 

 wing, distinctly roimded, the rectrices rather narrow. Tarsus long

 acrotarsiuin obvious but not distinct; middle toe, without claw, 

 about half as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx wholly united to outer 

 toe, more than half united to inner toe; outer toe, without claw, 

 reaching decidedly beyond, the inner about to, middle of sub ter- 

 minal phalanx of middle toe; hallux about as long as inner toe but 

 decidedly stouter, its claw short'^.r than digit; all the claws moder- 

 ately curved, sharp, compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive-green, the wings and tail dusky 

 with olive-green edgings, wing-coverts tipped with olive-yellowish 

 and tertials edged with same; beneath grayish white tinged with 

 ])ale yellow. 



Nidifieat'wn. — Nest "loosely constructed of dry grasses, leaves,

 Platyrhyyichiis raniToiiriniis Sclater and Salvin.) 



Very small Tyrannida^ (length not more than 00 mm., wing about 

 53-62 mm.) with the bill excessively broad and fiat (its width at base 

 about equal t»> length of exposed culmen), and tail less than half as 

 long as wing. 



"■ Nine specimens. 



Specimens from Costa Rica average slightly larger than those from Panama, but I am 

 Rdl aV)le to discern any difference in coloration.

 specifically separable. 



fTtAoTtK, flat, wide, broad, and TfnKKui, a small binl. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 381 



Bill excessively broad and Hal, its width at base about equal to 

 lencrth of exposed culmeii, its width at nostrils greater than distance 

 from nostril to tip of maxilla; exposed culmen about half as long as 

 head, rather distinctly ridged, nearly straight for most of its length, 

 gradually but decidedly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla rather 

 minutely uncinate; gonys about as long as mandibular rami, faintly 

 convex or nearly straight; lateral outlines of bill more or less strongly 

 convex, the extreme tip of both maxilla and mantUble, however, more 

 or less distinctly constricted. Nostril ex])osed, broatUy oval or round- 

 ish, in anterior end of nasal fossa*, overhung by rather broad mem- 

 brane. Rictal bristles greatly developetl but slender, reaching nearly 

 to tip of bill; latero-frontal feathers and feathers of chin with- 

 out bristly tips. Wing moik^rate, much rounded, the sixth, seventh, 

 and eighth primaries longest and about equal, ninth intermediate 

 between fifth and sixth, the tenth (outermost) not longer than second, 

 sometimes shorter than first; longest primaries exceeding seconchiries 

 by less than length of exposed culmen. Tail nearly lialf to a little 

 more than half as long as wing, slightly rounck'd. Tarsus longer 

 than commissure, the acrotarsium fused or ' 'booted " ; mi(klle toe, with 

 claw, much shorter than tarsus, its basal phalanx completely united 

 to outer toe, united for greater part of its length to inner toe; outer 

 toe (without claw) reaching nearly if not quite to terminal joint of 

 middle toe, the inner toe much shorter, reaching (without claw) only 

 to middle of subterminal phalanx of midtlle toe; hallux about as long 

 as inner toe but much stouter, its claw nearly if not quite as long as 

 the digit; all the claws moderately curved, sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Plain brown or olive above, the crown with or without 

 a concealed patch of white, yellow, or red; beneath pale olive or olive- 

 yellowish, more brown on chest, the throat sometimes white. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to western Ecuador, Paraguay, and 

 Argentina. (x\bout ten species, including subspecies.) 



This genus is quite distinct from Platyrincluis Desmaresf^ which 

 differs in having the tail relatively much longer (much more than 

 half as long as wing), the wing-tip much longer (longest primaries 

 exceeding distal secondaries by more than length of tarsus or nearly 

 half the length of tail), longer tenth (outermost) primary which equals 

 the fifth instead of being not h)nger than the third and usiudly shorter 

 than first, very much shorter tarsus (little more than one-fifth, 

 instead of nearly to quite one-third, as long as w4ng^ but little longer 

 than middle toe with claw, and less than luilf as long again instead of 

 nearly to quite twdce as long as exposed culmen), and presence of 

 bristly tips to feathers of the chin.

" I find on careful comparison of a considerable series of each form that the throat is 

 little, if any, whiter in P. albogularis than in P. mncrominus; neither does it, as a 

 rule, contrast more strongly with the general color of the under parts.

Bill shorter than head, very broad, its width at frontal antia^ equal 

 to or exceedmg distance from nostril to tip of maxilla and at least 

 twice its depth at same point, broadly triangular in vertical profile, 

 with lateral outlines more or less convex subtermmally; exposed 

 culmen decidedly, to much, shorter than tarsus, distinctly to obtusely 

 ridged, straight basally, then more and more strongly decurved 

 terminalh^, the tip of maxilla distinctly uncinate; gonys about as 

 long as mandibular rami, the inter-ramal space broadly rounded 

 anteriorly; maxillary tomium faintly sinuated or nearly straight, 

 distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril rather small, roundish, or 

 subvertically broadly oval, in anterior end of nasal fossae, with visible 

 membrane behmd but not above. Rictal bristles strong and feathers 

 of chin and frontal antia' with well developed bristly points. Wing 

 moderate, rather pointed, but longest primaries exceeding secondaries 

 by much less than length of tarsus (sometimes by less than length of 

 exposed culmen) ; seventh and eighth primaries longest, the sixth and 

 ninth but little shorter, the tenth (outermost) about equal to fifth, 

 sometimes slightly exceeding sixth, the barbs of its outer web at right 

 angles with the shaft, stiffened, and with strongly recurved tips." 

 Tail as long as wing from bend to end of secondaries, or slightly 

 shorter, even or very slightly rounded or double-rounded, the rectrices 

 widening terminally. Tarsus rather short and stout (one-fourth as 

 long as wing or a little less), its scutellation typically exaspidean, with 

 divisions of acrotarsium sometimes indistinct on outer side; middle 

 toe with claw decidedly shorter than tarsus, united to outer toe for 

 the whole of its first and a small part of its second phalanx, to inner 

 toe for greater part of its basal phalanx; outer toe, without claw, 

 reacliing nearly to terminal joint of middle toe, the inner much 

 shorter, barely extending to middle of subterminal phalanx of middle 

 toe; hallux about as long as inner toe, its claw" decidedl}" shorter than 

 the digit; all the claws moderately curved, sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive-green; beneath light olive-green,

Similar to Craspedoprion, but bill relatively smaller and narrower, 

 subterminal phalanx of middle toe entirely free from outer toe, and 

 edge of outer web of outermost primary never roughened. 



Bill much shorter than head, rather broadly triangular, nnich 

 depressed, its width at frontal antise about equal to or slightly less 

 than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla and about twice its depth 

 at same point; lateral outlines of bill faintly concave subbasally more 

 decidedly convex subterminally, where rather rapidly converging to 

 the distinctly uncinate tip of maxillq,; exposed culmen about equal to 

 middle toe without claw, distinctly but not sharply ridged, straight 

 basally, then first gradually but finally more strongly decurved to 

 the distinctly uncinate tip of maxilla; gonj'-s very slightly shorter

than mandibular rami, the interramal space much narrower and 

 rounded anteriorly; maxillary toinium straight or slightly sinuated, 

 distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril oval, nearly horizontal, in 

 anterior end of nasal fossas, margined above by narrow membrane 

 gradually widening posteriorly. Rictal bristles strongly developed, 

 and feathers of chin and frontal antiae with distinct bristly tips, those 

 of the latter extending at least halfway between nostril and tip of 

 maxilla, sometimes nearly to tip. Wmg moderate, much rounded, 

 with longest primaries exceeding secondaries by about length of 

 exposed culmen; seventh, sixth, seventh and eighth, or seventh, 

 eighth and ninth primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) shorter 

 than fifth, sometimes slightly shorter than first; outer web of outer- 

 most primary normal. Tail about as long as distance from bend of 

 wing to end of secondaries, even or slightly rounded, the rectrices 

 narrow but increasing in width terminally. Tarsus much less than 

 one-third but more than one-fourth as long as wing, its scutellation 

 typically exaspidean; middle toe, without claw, decidedly more than 

 half as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx wholly united to outer toe, the 

 second phalanx also adherent for greater part to inner toe, except in 

 P. sulphurescens,"' in which it is united for only about half its length; 

 outer toe, without claw, reaching to or beyond middle of subterminal 

 phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe distinctly shorter; hallux al:)Out 

 as long as inner toe but stouter, its claw shorter than the digit; all the 

 claws moderately curved, sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive-green, duller, sometimes grayish, on 

 pileum, the wings dusky with yellowish edgings, the middle and 

 greater coverts tipped with olive-yellow or yellowish olive; beneath 

 light 3^ellow or olive-yellow, tinged with olive on chest and sides, the 

 throat sometimes grayish. In P. fiamventris the upper parts light 

 yellowish olive-green, supraloral region and upper eyelid saffron yel- 

 low, under parts gamboge yellow, paler posteriorly. 



Nidification. — Nest (of R. cinereiceps) "a, pendulous inverted 

 pouch, suspended from a single twig, composed almost entirely of 

 slender black filaments resembling horse-hairs . . . so loosely Inult 

 as to be easily seen through when held up to the light ; ' ' the entrance 

 "at the extreme lower end, the nest proper being a sort of pocket on 

 one side, about 2 inches above the entrance." Eggs, flesh colored, 

 with a ring around larger end of violet and reddish brown spots.^ 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay. (About 

 ten species.) 



a P . Jlavo-olivaceus Lawrence, which Doctor Sclater synonymizes with P. sulphur- 

 escens differs conspicuously in respect to extent of cohesion of the anterior toes, the 

 second phalanx of the middle toe being united to the outer toe for its entire length. It 

 is also sufficiently distinct in coloration.

rfThis very distinct species, although synonymized by Doctor Sclater with R. sul-

 size, much darker coloration of upper parts, and conspicuous clear yellow wing- 

 markings. ^ 



The specimen from Costa Rica (Carrillo, Nov. 24, 1898, C. F. Underwood), in Mr. 

 Bangs' collection, is precisely like the type in coloration except that the pileum 

 and hindneck are slightly darker and decidedly clearer slate color, contrasting quite 

 abruptly with the olive-green of the back, and the yellow of the wing-markings and 

 alxlomen slightly deeper, differences doubtless due, in part at least, to the ])lumage 

 being fresher. The measurements, however, are decidedly different, comparing with 

 those of the type from Panama as follows :

 Serphnphaga (emendation) Cabanis and Heine, Mus. Ilein., ii, 1859, 53. 



Small Tyrannida^ (wing not more than 63 mm., usually much less), 

 with small slender bill, basal j)halanx of middle toe onl}' about half 

 united to outer toe, and almost wholly free from inner toe, the colora- 

 tion plain gray and dusky above, with ])ai'tially concealed white spot 

 on crown, plain light gray or grayish wliite below (sometimes passing 

 into pale yellow on abdomen, etc.). 




396 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Bill about half as long as head, very narrow, its width at frontal 

 antia" equal to less than two-thirds the distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla, but decidedly greater than its depth at same point; exposed 

 culmen much shorter than middle toe without claw, distincth^ and 

 rather sharply ridged, straight to near tip, where gradually but not 

 strongly decurved, the tip of maxilla not strongly uncinate; gonys 

 decidedly longer than mandilndar rami, nearly straight, ascending 

 terminally, its base usually rather jjrominent; maxillary tomium 

 nearly straight, but more or less concave subbasally, distinctly 

 notched subterminally. Nostril longitudinally oval or sometimes 

 almost linear, with distinct, sometimes broad, superior membrane. 

 Rictal bristles well developed, and feathers of chin and frontal antise 

 with distinct bristly points. Wing moderate, much rounded, with 

 longest primaries exceeding secondaries by about length of exposed 

 ci.ilmen; seventh and eighth, or seventh, eighth, and ninth, ])rimaries 

 longest, the tenth (outermost) equal to first, sometimes longer than 

 fourth. Tail not shorter than distance from bend of wing to end of 

 secondaries, sometimes long as wing, slightly rounded or double- 

 rounded, the rectrices rather broad, at least terminally. Tarsus 

 rather long and slender, nearly one-third to slightly more than one- 

 third as long as wing, its scutellation typically exaspidean; middle 

 toe, without claw, slightly less to decidedly more than half as long as 

 tarsus, its basal phalanx united for only about half its length, or a 

 little more, to outer toe, mostly free from inner toe; outer toe, with- 

 out claw, reaching to or beyond middle of subterminal ])halanx of 

 middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter; hallux about as long as 

 inner toe, but much stouter, its claw as long, or nearly as long, as 

 digit; all the claws moderately curved, sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain gray, the pileum, wings, and tail some- 

 times black or dusky, the crown with a partially concealed patch of 

 white ; under parts light gray, or very pale gray anteriorly and pale 

 yellow posteriorly. 



Nidification. — Nest cup-shaped, placed in a bush or beneath an 

 overhanging bank, composed of various soft materials lined with 

 plant down, feathers, etc. Eggs (2-4) white or cream-colored, with or 

 without black and grayish spots around larger end. 



Range. — Costa Rica to Peru, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. 

 (About ten species and subspecies.)

 different coloration (brown above with russet edgings and bands on 

 wings, and without white crown-spot). I am also doubtfid whether

 even or slightly double-rounded, the rectrices widening terminally 

 (except in M. cotta). Tarsus more than one-fourth but less than 

 one-third as long as wing, slender, its scutella distinct and t}^)ically

 hallux about as long as inner toe or slighth^ shorter, its claw shorter 

 than the digit; all the claws moderately curved, compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive or olive-green, passing into dusky 

 olive, or slate-gray streaked with dusky, on pileum, the crown with a 

 partly concealed patch of lemon yellow or yellowish white; middle 

 and greater wing-coverts sometimes tipped with pale yellow or yel- 

 lowish white ; under parts grayish white anteriorly, passing into light 

 yellow or yellowish wliite posteriorly. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Peru, Bolivia, southeastern Brazil, 

 and Guiana; one species peculiar to Jamaica. (About eight species 

 and subspecies.)

At least two species must be removed from this genus. One of 

 these is Muscicapara gaimardi D'Orbigny and Lafresnaye/' which, 

 having pycnaspidean tarsi, must be placed (according to our present 

 definition of Oligomyodean groups) in the Cotingidse;'' the other is 

 Elainea rufice/ps Pelzeln, '^ a true Tyrannine, but certainly not a mem- 

 ber of the present genus, from which it differs in relatively much 

 larger and broader bill, much stouter feet, shorter and more rounded 

 wing, relatively much shorter tail, differently shaped nostrils, and 

 dissimilar coloration, and not being referable to any other genus, 

 should constitute one by itself.

 in considering it the same as Muscicapara gaiynardi D'Orbigny; but as Doctor Sclater 

 erroneously referred another form to the same species, E. macilvainii Lawrence, which 

 is at least subspecifically distinct, he may have erred in this case also.

 gray or dusky, the wings dusky with olive-yellowish edgings and some- 

 times with pale yellowish tips to middle and greater coverts; beneath 

 dull whitish or grayish white tinged posteriorly with pale yellow, or

somewhat aberrant in having the tail very nearly as long as the 

 wing, the middle toe longer, compared with the tarsus, and the bill 

 slightly more depressed, the differences are by no means sufficient to 

 warrant placing it in a different genus. Whether it is really a Pogo- 

 notriccus"' or not I am not able to determine, no species of that sup- 

 posed genus being at present available for comparison; but if it should 

 prove to be congeneric with the type of the latter then Pogonotriccus 

 should be considered a synonym of Tyranniscus.

 Phyllooeda Bertoni, Aves Nueves del Paraguay, Jan., 1901, 120. (Type, P. chlo- 



roleuca 'BertoTii=Leptotnceus sylviolus Cabanis and Heine. &) 



I have not seen any species of this genus and therefore am unable 

 to give an original diagnosis. Unfortunately, neither the original 

 describer nor later authorities characterize the genus adequately. 

 A free translation of Cabanis' diagnosis is as follows: 



In form of bill similar to Serpophaga, but wings more strongly developed and 

 rather longer, tail-feathers wider and longer, and plumage greenish, resembling that 

 of Euscarthmus. 



Sclater (Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, 1888, 99) says: 



In Lcptotriccus the bill is longer antl more eompressed than in Pogonotriccus, and the 

 rictal l)ristles not quite so dense, but the forms are closely allied. The feet are weak as 

 in Pogonotriccus . but the tarsi are rather longer. 



Salvin and Godman (Biol. Centr.-Am., Aves, ii, 1888, 18) do not 

 throw much additional light on its relationships, thfeir remarks on the 

 subject being as follows: 



With a bill similar to that of Lophotriccas the rictal bristles seem to be longer, there 

 is no occipital crest, the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th quills are nearly equal, lst=8th, the tail 

 is long and very slightly rounded, and the feathers wide.- than in Todirostrnm,,

Very small Tyrannidse (wing about 44-55 mm.) with short and 

 compressed bill (ex})osed culmen strongly curved, shorter than middle 

 toe without claw), small rounded nostrils near center of nasal fossae, 

 minute or obsolete rictal bristles, and plain, dull coloration (plain

« Sclater, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, 1888, 100. A translation of Salvin and God- 

 man's description (in La(in) in the Biologia Centrall-Aiuericana {Aves, ii, 1888, 18) i.s 

 as follows: 



"Above greenish olive; wings and tail blackish, with yellowish olive edgings; 

 pileum and hindneck blackish cinereous; superciliary region chestnut; frontal line 

 and parotic region white; beneath pearly white, the breast, particularly on sides, 

 suffused with cinereous; abdomen and crissum yellowish; under wing-coverts white; 

 bill black; feet dusky hazel. Total length 4, wing 1.95, tail 2, bill, to rictus, 0.55, 

 tarsus 0.05." (Description of a female from Calovevora. Panama.) 



To the above the authors cited add: "In its long slender tarsi and delicate feet this 

 species resembles Leptotriccus sylriota of Brazil, and it also has the pointed wings and 

 long tail of that bird; the bill, however, is somewhat larger and wid(>r. 



" The distinct chestnut superciliary streak over each eye is a strongly marked 

 characteristic feature of L. superciliaris.^^

Bill small and compressed, not more than half as long as head; 

 exposed culmen shorter than middle toe without claw, distinctly, 

 almost sharply, ridged, strongly curved from near base, the tip of 

 maxilla minutely and not distinctly uncinate ; gonys much longer than 

 mandibular rami, nearly straight ; maxillary tomium more or less con- 

 cave, minutely and not very distinctly notched subterminally ; width 

 of bill at frontal antife equal to about half the length of exposed cul- 

 men, and little if any greater than its depth at same point. Nostril 

 small, roundish, near center of nasal fossae, entirely surrounded by 

 membrane. Rictal bristles obvious on close inspection, but very 

 small ; feathers of chin and frontal antiiP with minute bristly points. 

 Wing moderate, with longest primaries exceeding secondaries by 

 about the length of exposed culmen, or considerably less; ninth, 

 eighth, or seventh, eighth, and ninth, primaries longest and nearly 

 equal, the tenth (outermost) not shorter than fourth, sometimes in- 

 termediate between fifth and sixth. Tail about three-fourths as 

 long as wing (much shorter than distance from bend of wing to end of 

 secondaries), even or very faintly emarginate or double-rounded, 

 the rectrices moderately broad, with broadly rounded tip. Tarsus 

 about one-fourth to nearly one-third as long as wing, rather slender; 

 acrotarsium extending entirely across outer side of tarsus, but the two 

 edges widely separated by a broad nonscutellate strip occupying the 

 posterior half of inner side of the tarsus; middle toe, without claw, de- 

 cidedly more than half as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx wholly 

 united to outer toe and at least half connected with inner toe ; outer 

 toe, without claw, reaching about to middle of subterminal phalanx! 

 of middle toe, the inner slightly but decidedly shorter; hallux about 

 as long as inner toe, its claw decidedly shorter than the digit; all the 

 claws rather strongly curved, sharp, compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain gray or olive, the wings dusky with pale 

 edgings, some species with the middle and greater coverts more or less 

 broadly tipped with pale yellowish olive, dull whitish, or cinnamome- 

 ous ; under parts grayish white, tinged with pale gray on chest and 

 sides, or pale yellow, with or without olive shading on chest and sides, 

 the throat sometimes pale grayish. 



Range. — Southwestern border of United States to Ecuador, Guiana, 

 and southeastern Brazil. (About ten species and subspecies.)

a As a rule I am unable to distinguish the sexes by any external characters; Init some 

 males have the feathers of the pileum much longer, especially on the occiput, forming a 

 very distinct-crest, and these elongated feathers are sooty in color, margined with gray- 

 ish olive. It may be that those males resembling females in the color and development 

 of the crest feathers are immature birds.

The above synonomy is chiefly from a paper by Berlepsch and Hellmayr, in Journ. 

 fiir Orn., 1905, 1-33. In the collection of the U. S. National Museum are specimens 

 labeled Myiopatis seinifusca which seem to belong to the present genus, but they cer- 

 tainly are not the species under consideration. The localities which they represent 

 are La Guaira and Caracas, Venezuela, and Santa Marta, Colombia. They are much 

 smaller than S. fasciatus, having the wing less than 60 mm., but like that species and 

 S. glaber and unlike the equally small S. virescens have the pileiim and back concolored 

 (grayish brown). 



h Sublegatus virescens Allen, Bull. Am. Mus. N. H., ii, June 28, 1889, 149 (Chapada, 

 Mattogrosso, s. w. Brazil; coll. Am. Mus. N. S.), 



A very distinct species, easily distinguished by its olive-green back in contrast with 

 brownish gray pileum and hindneck. 



The following species of this genus I have not seen:

SUBLEGATUS GLABER Sclater and Salvin. 

 SMOOTH FLYCATCHER. 



Adults {sexes alike). — Above plain o;rayisli browai (deep hair brown), 

 the pileiim sometimes ver}^ slightly darker or browner, with feathers 

 darker mediall}", producing very indistinct streaks; wings and tail 

 dusky grayish brown with paler grayish brown edgings, the secondaries 

 edged (except basally) with dtdl whitish, the middle and greater wing- 

 coverts rather broadly tipped with the same or paler grayish brown; 

 indistinct supraloral line and eyelids dull white; a dusky grayish 

 loral spot immediately in front of eye ; auricular and postocular regions 

 similar in color to pileum and hindneck: suborbital and malar regions 



« Doctor Sclater's description of the same specimen (Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, 153) 

 is as follows: 



Above dark cinereous with a slight olive tinge; head, wings, and tail blackish; 

 outer margins of wing-coverts and secondaries and narrow tips of tail-feathers whitish; 

 beneath, throat and breast pale cinereous white; belly and under wing-coverts pale 

 sulphur-yellow; bill horn-color, feet blackish; whole length 5.5 inches, wing 2.7, 

 tail 2.6. 



Notwithstanding the conclusion of Messrs. Salvin and Godman (Biol. Centr.-Am., 

 Aves, ii, 37) that this bird is the same as Sublegatus glaber Sclater and Salvin, there 

 seems to be good reason for believing they are in erroi*. Dr. J. A. Allen (Bull. Am. 

 Mus. N. H., ii, 1889, 208) says: 



"Respecting this, one may well be excused from venturing an opinion unless able 

 to examine the type. While Mr. Sclater retains the species in Elainea, Mr. Salvin, 

 the original describer, refers it to Sublegatus, and considers it not specifically different 

 from Sublegatus glaber Scl. & Salv. S. glaber is figured in P. Z. S., 1868, pi. xiii, fig. 2, 

 and E. arenarum in the "Biologia," pi. xxxvi, fig. 3. A comparison of the two plates, 

 purporting to represent the same species, is enough to warn away th(^ timid from any 

 interference in such a complicated case. It is to b(> hoped, however, that some expla- 

 nation will be given of how the same species can differ so grc>atly as these figures repre- 

 sent, in respect both to the form of the bill and coloration, particularly in the color of 

 the loral region and the lower surface generally." 



Dr. Ernst Hartert more recently says (Novit. Zool., ix, 1902, 45, f(X)tnote'i th(>y are 

 not the same, and that in S. arenarum the pileum "is much darker, almost blackish."

 more) ; seventh, eighth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, or seventh, eighth, 

 and ninth primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) at least equal to 

 third, sometimes equal to fifth. Tail nearly as long as wing, even, 

 slightly emarginate or slightly double-rounded, the rectrices moderate 

 in width, widening perceptibly toward tip. Tarsus usually a little less 

 than one-fourth as long as wing (decidedly more than one-fourth as

Coloration. — Above plain gray or olive, the crown sometimes with a 

 concealed patch of white or yellowish white; wings dusky with pale 

 edgings, the greater and middle coverts broadly tipped with dull whit- 

 ish or pale olive, producing two distinct bands; under parts pale yel- 

 lowish or whitish more or less strongly shaded (except in E. falJax) 

 with olive or gra3dsh on chest and sides (throat also sometimes pale 

 olive or grayish) . 



Nidijication. — Nest shallow cup-shaped or saucer-shaped, compact, 

 ornamented externally with spiders' webs, lichens, etc., lined with 

 feathers, hair, or other soft materials, placed in bushes or small trees. 

 Eggs (usually 2) creamy white to deep cream color, spotted, chiefly 

 round larger end, with reddish brown, etc.

The species of the genus Elsenia are involved in the greatest con- 

 fusion, and no genus of American birds is more in need of careful and 

 thorough revision. Even the small number of forms belonging to the 

 field of the present work has given me the greatest trouble, and I must 

 confess that I am not satisfied with the manner in which I have been 

 able to work them out, both the time and material necessary being 

 wanting.

a Forty-one specimens. 



Notwithstanding the large number of specimens examined, so many of them are in 

 poor condition of phimage and the series from the different islands so unequal, that a 

 satisfactory comparison is impossible. Therefore, for the present, I can only "lump" 

 all the more grayish West Indian birds, or rather those with the under parts whitish 

 instead of yellow, under one name and leave for otliers who may be able to bring 

 together a more satisfactory series the labor of determining whether the series can be 

 divided into two or more recognizably different forms. If the birds from Barbados 

 are separable, certainly those from some other islands are also; and I believe that 

 eventually several forms will have to be recognized.

EL.«NIA MARTINICA SUBPAGANA (Sclater and Salvin). 

 NORTHERN EL^ffiNIA. 



Similar to E. m. martinica, but under parts of body yellow instead 

 of white and (usually) general coloration more olivaceous. 



Adults (sexes alilce) . — Above plain olive, becoming slightly browner 

 on rump and upper tail-coverts, the elongated feathers of pileum 

 darker mesially, forming indistinct streaks, those in postero-central 

 portion of the pileum with the concealed portion white, or yellowish 

 white ; tail deep grayish brown (hair brown or broccoli) , the rectrices 

 edged with lighter brown or olive; wings dusky, the greater and 

 middle coverts broadly tipped with pale grayish brown (sometimes 

 faintly buffy), the secondaries edged (except basally) with pale olive- 

 yellowish, the inner secondaries (tertials) more broadly edged with 

 dull whitish, the primaries and greater coverts narrowly edged with 

 pale olive; sides of head grayish olive, gradually fading below into 

 pale gray or grayish wliite on chin and throat; lores pale grayish or 

 grayish white; a narrow orbital ring of dull white; chest and sides 

 of breast pale yellowish gray, gradually fading out on flanks; rest of 

 under parts, including axillars and under wing-coverts, light yellow 

 (between sulphur and straw yellow) ; maxilla brownish basally, dusky 

 terminally; mandible paler, with dusky tip; iris brown; legs and feet 

 blackish (in dried skins). 



Young. — Similar to adults but color of upper parts browner, the 

 rump, upper tail-coverts, and edges of rectrices inclining to wood 

 brown or russet; no white on pileum; wing-bands pale buff or buffy 

 white; edges of secondaries buffy (varying from yellowish to brown- 

 ish) ; yellow of under parts paler. 



Adult 7nale.— Length (skins), 137-173 (159); wing, 74-84.5 (79.9); 

 tail, 63-77.5 (72.6); exposed culmen, 10.5-13 (11.8); tarsus, 19-22

 18.5-21 (19.6); middle toe, 11-13 (11.7).« 



o Thirty specimens. 



I am not able to separate the Antillean from the continental series, but they are 

 mostly in worn or otherwise poor plumage, so that satisfactory comparison can not be 

 made; but they certainly are not the same as E. m. flavogastra of South America, to 

 which they have been referred. 



Most of the specimens from Saboga Island, Bay of Panama, and some specimens from 

 the vicinity of Panama City have the color of the upper parts paler and very much 

 grayer than others, even more so than E. m. flavogastra, and it is possible they may 

 represent a form worthy of recognition.

EL.^NIA FRANTZII FRANTZII Lawrence. 

 FRANTZIUS' EL.a:NIA. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Above plain brownish olive, the center of 

 crown rarely with a few white streaks on basal portion of feathers;*^ 

 tail deep grayish brown (hair brown) with light greenish olive edgings; 

 wings dusky, the middle and greater coverts broadly (but not sharply) 

 tipped with pale yellowish olive (usually paler and more yellowish on 

 greater coverts), forming two distinct bands, the secondaries broadly 

 edged (except basally) with pale olive-yellow, the primaries and 

 greater coverts narrowly edged with pale olive; sides of head and 

 neck similar in color to pileum and hindneck but slightly paler, 

 slightly relieved by an indistinct supraloral streak and indistinct 

 narrow orbital ring of very pale olive or dull olive-whitish; chin, 

 tlu'oat, chest, sides, and flanks pale yellowish olive or grayish olive- 

 buff, passing into pale straw yellow on abdomen, under tail-coverts, 

 and median portion of breast; axillars and under wing-coverts 

 mostly pale straw yellowish; maxilla dark brown or horn brown, 

 mandible much paler, sometimes brownish at tip; iris brown; legs 

 and feet dark brown. 



a I am not able to verify other characters given in the original description as dis- 

 tinguishing the two forms, which, indeed, I have much difficulty in separating satis- 

 factorily. 



b Eight specimens. 



c Six specimens. 



rf Although Doctor Sclater (Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, pp. 136, 137, 145) places this 

 species in the section of the genus characterized by possession of a white "vertical 

 spot," I find, after careful examination of thirty-two adults that only eight of these 

 (exactly one in four) ha^'e even a trace of white on center of crown, and in none of 

 these eight does the white amount to more than a minute streak at the base of a few 

 feathers.

Genus LEGATUS Sclater. 



Legatiis Sclater, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, 40. (Type, Trjrannns albicoUis 

 Vieillot.) 



Rather small or medium sized Tyrannidfr (wing 80-92 mm.) with 

 tarsus not longer than middle toe without claw, width of bill at frontal 

 antifB nearly equal to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla, tail only 

 slightly more than two-thirds as long as wing, the under parts con- 

 spicuously streaked with grayish on a yellowish white or pale yellow 

 ground, a broad white superciliary stripe, and concealed yellow patch 

 on crown. 



Bill very short and broad, less than half as long as head, its w^idth at 

 frontal anti?e nearly equal to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla, 

 exceeding length of gonys, and about twice its depth at same point, 

 rather broadly triangular in vertical profile, with lateral outlines 

 nearly straight; exposed culmen decidedly shorter than middle toe 

 without claw, distinctly ridged, straight for basal two-thirds (ap'^rox- 

 imately) then strongly decurved, the tip of maxilla not strongly unci- 

 nate; gonys shorter than mandibular rami, faintly convex; maxillary 

 tomium nearly straight, minutely and indistinctly notched subter- 

 minally. Nostril partly exposed, rather large, oblique, overhung by 

 rather broad membrane, this, however, covered by short latero-frontal 

 feathering except portion above anterior end of nostril. Rictal bris- 

 tles small, and feathers of chin and malar and frontal antise with 

 small, very inconspicuous, bristly points. Wing long and pointed, 

 the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by nearly twice the length 

 of tarsus; ninth primary longest, eighth slightly shorter, the tenth 

 (outermost) intermediate between sixth and seventh. Tail slightly 

 more than two-thirds as long as wing (a little longer than distance 

 from bend of wing to end of distal secondaries), even or very slightly 

 double-rounded. Tarsus less than one-fifth as long as wing, stout, its 

 scutellation typically exaspidean, the acrotarsial divisions distinct; 

 middle toe, with claw, equal to tarsus, its basal phalanx united for 

 most of its length to outer toe, for about half its length to inner toe; 

 outer toe, without claw, reaching about to middle of subterminal pha- 

 lanx of middle toe, the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux as long as 

 inner toe or very slightly shorter, decidedly, but not conspicuoush^, 

 stouter, its claw decidedly shorter than the digit ; all the claws rather 

 small (especially that of the hallux), slightly curved, moderately 

 sharp and compressed. 



Coloration. — Above grayish brown, the cro\vn with a concealed spot 

 of yellow, the larger wing-coverts and secondaries with narrow pale 

 edgings; a broad superciliary stripe of dull white; under parts grayish 

 white anteriorly passing into pale yellow on under parts of body, the 

 chest and sides broadly streaked with light grayish.

LEGATUS ALBICOLLIS iVieillot). 

 STRIPED FLYCATCHER. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum (except forehead) dark sooty b^o^v^l, 

 inclosino; a central concealed spot of lemon or canary yellow; back, 

 scapulars, lesser wing-coverts, and rump deep grayish brown or olive, 

 the feathers with more or less distinct paler margins; upper tail-coverts 

 similar but rather darker and usually more or less distinctly margined 

 with rusty, cinnamon, or fulvous; tail very dark sooty brown or black- 

 ish brown, the outer webs of rectrices narrowly edged w4th light olive 

 (nearly white, or yellowish white, on outermost rectrix), the inner webs 

 edged with pale grayish brown, pale rusty, or pale fulvous; wings 

 bro\\Tiish black, the middle coverts margined terminally (more or less 

 distiiytly) ^ with w^hitish, the greater coverts and secondaries edged 

 Avith the same, these whitish edgings much broader on inner second- 

 aries ('Hertials") and obsolete toward base of outer secondaries; pri- 

 maries very narrowly edged with pale gra3ash brown; a broad super- 

 ciliary stripe of dull white (sometimes faintly tinged with yellow), the 

 posterior (supra-auricular) j^ortion faintly streaked with grayish, the 

 anterior portion invading tlie forehead, where the two of opposite 

 sides usually are confluent; loral, suborbital, and auricular regions 

 dark sooty brown, the latter sometimes with minute shaft-streaks of 

 paler; malar region, chin, and throat white, the first flecked, more or 

 less, with grayish, the throat usually margined along each side by a 

 mtjre or less distinct submalar streak of grayish or sooty; rest of under 

 parts sulphur yellow, sometimes white or nearly so anteriorly, the chest, 

 breast (except medially), sides, and flanks broadly striped with brown- 

 ish gray or olive, the under tail and wing coverts with V-shaped or 

 cuneate streaks of the same; bill brownish black, the mandible more 

 brownish basally ; iris brown; legs and feet black. 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but pileum without any yellow, and 

 often tinged with rusty; superciliary stripe pale buff or bufiy white, 

 the two of opposite sides confluent (or nearly so) on nape; middle and 

 greater -vving-coverts broadly margined terminally with rusty, cinna- 

 mon, or cinnamon-bulf ; rectrices edged with rusty, and imder parts 

 nearly (sometimes quite) immaculate. 



Adult male.~l^engt\i (skins), 131-160 (145); wing, 76.5-96 (84.9); 



a Eggs yellowish white, with a ring of cinnamon-brown spots round larger end. 

 (Ihering, Rev. Mus. Paul., iv, 1900, 233.) According to Mr. Gerald B. Thomas (in 

 letter), however, eggs of this species (from British Honduras) are "almost a uniform 

 chocolate brown, with here and there long wavy scrawls as in Orioh>s' (rctcntx) eggs."

 Myiozetetes (emendation) Sclater, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, 46. (Typo, Mu.s- 



cicapa cayanensis Linnaeus.) 



Medium-sized Tyrannidse (wing about 80-100 mm.), with small and 

 narrow bill (exposed culmen little if any longer than middle toe with- 

 out claw, its width at anterior end of nostrils equal to about half the 

 distance from nostril to tip, and not greater than its depth at same 

 point), tail at least three-fourths as long as wing; adults with an 

 orange or scarlet crown-patch, white superciliary stripe, and under 

 parts bright yellow, the throat white. 



Bill about half as long as head, narrow, its width at anterior end of 

 nostrils not greater than its depth at same point, and equal to about 

 half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; exposed culmen little 

 if any greater than length of middle toe without claw, distinctly 

 ridged, straight for most of its length, gradually but decidedly 

 decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla moderately uncinate; gonys 

 much longer than mandibular rami, more or less (usually faintly) con- 

 vex; maxillary tomium nearly straight, distinctly notched subter- 

 minally. Nostril at least partly exposed, longitudinally or obliquely 

 oval, overhung by narrow membrane, the nasal fossee narrower and 

 rounded anteriorly. Rictal bristles small but distinct, the feathers of 

 chin, malar antiffi, and frontal antise with small but distinct bristly 

 antrorse tips. Wing rather large and pointed, the longest primaries 

 exceeding distal secondaries by not more (usually decidedly less) than 

 length of tarsus; ninth, eighth and ninth, or seventh, eighth, and ninth 

 primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) shorter than fourth to nearly 

 as long as fifth. Tail more than three-fourths to four-fifths as long as 

 wing, slightly emarginate or double-rounded, the rectrices firm, rather 

 ])road, with broadl}^ rounded tip. Tarsus equal in length to middle 

 toe with claw (or sometimes ver;^ slightly longer or shorter), stout, its 

 scutellation typically exaspidean, the acrotarsial divisions distinct, 

 and outer side of tarsus without separate series of scutella on upper 

 posterior portion; middle toe, without claw, equal to or very slightly 

 longer than exposed culmen, its basal phalanx united to outer toe for 

 entire length, or very nearly so, to inner toe for about half its length; 

 outer toe, without claw, reaching to about middle of subterminal pha-

lanx of middle toe, the Inner toe very slightly shorter; hallux al)out 

 equal to inner toe or slightly shorter, decidedl}^ but not conspicuonsh' 

 stouter, its claw shorter than th(^ digit; all the claws rather large, mod- 

 erately to strongly curved, sharp, compressed. 



Coloration. — A conspicuous superciliary stripe of white or else 

 pileum light gray passing into white on forehead; crown (in adults) 

 with a concealed patch of orange or scarlet; back, etc., plain olive or 

 olive-greenish, the wings and tail darker with paler edgings (primaries 

 sometimes edged with rufous); sides of head dusky; throat white, the 

 rest of imder parts bright lemon yellow. 



Nidification. — Nest a bulky, roundish mass of dry grass and weed 

 stems, etc., with entrance in one side near top, placed in bushes or 

 small trees. Eggs white or pale cream color, speckled, chiefly around 

 larger end, with dark brown, lavender, etc. 



Range. — Northern IVIexico to Guiana, Peru, and southeastern Brazil. 

 (About six sj^tecies and subsi:)ecies.)" 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF MYIOZETETES. l) 



a. A broad white superciliary stripe, extending above auricular region to occiput. 

 b. Distal secondaries and proximal primaries distinctly edged with 'rusty; sides of 

 pileum, auricular region, etc., sooty blackish; crown-patch more y(>llowish 

 orange or orange-yellow. {Myiozetetes cayanensis.) 

 c. Smaller, with less of rusty on wing. (Amazon Valley to western Ecuador, 

 Colombia, Venezuela, etc., and Panama.) 



Myiozetetes cayanensis cayanensis. (p.444). 

 cc. Larger, with more of rusty on wing. (.Soutiiern Brazil. ) 



Myiozetetes cayanensis erythroptei"us ( extralimital ) .c 

 bb. Distal secondaries and proximal |)rimaries not edged with rusty; sides of pileum, 

 auricular region, etc., more or less grayish; crown-patch more reddish orange 

 or orange-red. 



aMusdcapa sulphurea Spix {Myiozetetes sulphureus Cabanis and Heine, Sclater, and 

 others) is certainly not congeneric (see ' 'key" to the genera, p. 344). Elxnia lutciven- 

 tris Sclater (Myiozetetes luteivcntris Sclater) I have not seen. 



bl have not seen the following species, referred to this genus by Doctor Sclater:

 coll. Verreaux). — Myiozetetes bUeiventris Sclater, Cat. Am. Birds, 18G2, 219; Proc.

 Ecuador); Pelzeln, Orn. Bras., ii. Abth., 1869, 109 (Maribatanas, n. Brazil). 



Myiozetetes sulphureus of authors (Muscicapa sulphurea Spix, Av. Bras., ii, 1825, 

 16, pi. 20) I consider not a member of this genus and have made it the type of a new one 

 {Tyrannopsis Ridgway, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xviii, Sept. 2, 1905, 209). 



The young of the different forms of Myiozetetes are so poorly represented in the series 

 oi specimens examined that I am unable to include them in the key.

and lesser wing-coverts plain olive-green ; upper tail-coverts dusky or 

 dark olive margined with paler olive or olive-green; wings (except 

 lesser coverts) and tail dusky grayish brown, the rectrices edged with 

 light olive, the remiges and greater wing-coverts edged with light yel- 

 lowish olive, the middle wing-coverts margined terminally with the 

 same or with light grayish olive; loral, suborbital, and auricvUar 

 regions dusky; malar region, chin, and throat white or yellowish 

 white, the first tinged or indistinctly streaked with grayish; rest of 

 under parts, including axillars and under wing-coverts, bright canary 

 or lemon yellow, the sides of chest more or less tinged with olive; bill, 

 legs, and feet black; iris brown; length (skins), 151-173 (160); wing, 

 81-90 (86.6); tail, 66-72 (69.7); exposed culmen, 1.3-15 (14); tarsus, 

 16.5-19 (18.1); middle toe, 12-14 (13).'^ 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male, but without orange on 

 crown or else with a much smaller patch of this color ;^ length 

 (skins), 149-163 (155); wing, 80-88 (82.6); tail, 64-70 (66.9);

 olive-green, rectrices broadly edged (on both webs) with tawny, mid- 

 dle wing-coverts margined with light tawny l^rown or cinnamon, 

 greater coverts and secondaries edged with the same (paler and more 

 yellowish on inner secondaries or Hertials") and yellow of under

b In eight out of eleven adult specimens sexed as females there is not a trace of orange 

 on the crown, while in three there is a very small area of this color. In twelve adult 

 males all l)ut one have a large concealed patch of orange, one having none at all. This 

 specimen I suspect to be a female with sex wrongly determined.

Specimens from Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago have the throat more distinctly 

 and more extensively olivaceous, besides presenting oth er differences, and probably 

 should be separated subspecifically from those of eastern Brazil. An example from 

 Pebas, eastern Peru, on the other hand, seems to l)e indistinguishable from Bahia 

 specimens.

 GRAY-CAPPED LEPTOPOGON. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileuin dusky gray or deep slate color (the 

 feathers indistinctly darker centrally or niesially), the hindneck 

 similar, but tinged with olive-green; back, scapulars, rump, and 

 lesser wing-coverts plain olive-green, the upper tail-coverts similar 

 but browner; tail deep grayish brown, the outer webs of rectrices 

 broadly edged with olive-green; wings (except lesser coverts) dusky, 

 the outer webs of middle and greater coverts with broad terminal 

 spots of pale olive-yellow or buff ;'^ primaries narrowly, secondaries 

 broadly, edged with light olive-yellow or yellowish olive, these 

 edgings much broader and clear primrose yellow on inner secondaries 

 ("tertials"); loral and suborbital regions pale grayish or grayish 

 white, flecked \\i\\\ dusky; a few wliitish dots or flecks at posterior 

 angle of eye; terminal portion of auricular region uniform black or 

 dusky, the anterior portion light olive or grayish with narrow shaft- 

 streaks of wliitish; chin and upper throat pale olive-grayish, passing 

 into light yellowish olive on lower throat, chest, and sides; rest of 

 imder parts light yellow (sulphur to primrose) ; axillars and under 

 wing-coverts similar; inner webs of remiges rather broadly edged 

 with yellowish white or pal(> buff; bill black or dusky with paler 

 tomia, usually with tip and base of mandible also pale; iris brown;* 

 legs and feet horn color or dusky in dried skins, pale bluish in life.^ 



Adult male.— hei\gi\\ (skins), 129-138 (133); wing, 65.5-68.5 (67.2);

Owing to insufficiency of material I am not aisle to determine whether there are 

 constant differences in this species according to geographic area. All the specimens 

 from Costa Rica and Panama (thirteen in number) have the wing-bands buff; of three 

 from Venezuela two have the wing-bands pale primrose yellow, the third has them 

 yellowish buff, this coming from the same locality and obtained at nearly the same 

 date as one of the other two. In a specimen from Quito, Ecuador, the wing-bands are 

 pale buffy yellow, while in one from Peru (a cotype of L. superdliaris Cabanis) and 

 one from Yungas, Bolivia, they are pale primrose yellow or yellowish white. The 

 Bolivian specimen has the under parts much paler than any of the others, the abdomen, 

 etc., being yellowish white, the chest, etc., slightly olivaceous gray, and the upper 

 parts are darker and duller olive-green. If these peculiarities are not the result of 

 wearing or fading, this specimen doubtless represents a different subspecies. 



&As stated in the footnote above, it is probable that the South American birds 

 represent two or more forms; but not having material sufficient to enable me to define 

 them satisfactorily, I have thought best for the present purpose to throw all the extra- 

 limital references and localities together.

Pyrocephalus Gould, Zool. Voy. " Beagle," iii, July, 1839, 44. (Types, ' 'Pyroceph- 

 alus parvirostris (Gould) and Muscicapa coronata (Auct.) " = Musdcapa rubinus 

 Boddaert.) 



Small Tyrannida^ (wing about 52-85 mm.) with the sexes very 

 differently colored, adult males having the whole pileum and under- 

 parts bright scarlet or orange, adult females with under parts more 

 or less pale red or orange posteriorly and streaked on breast with 

 grayish, young with upper parts squamated with whitish." 



Bill shorter than head, moderately broad and depressed basally, 

 its width at anterior end of nostrils equal to not more than half the 

 length of exposed cidmen and less than twice its depth at same point, 

 wedge-shaped in vertical profile, its lateral outlines nearly straight, 

 the tip but very slightly if at all constricted; exposed culmen longer 

 than middle toe without claw, distinctly ridged, straight to near tip 

 where rather gradually decurved, the tip of maxilla moderately 



"A form of western Peru (P. obscurus Gould) which seems to be a melani.sm of P. 

 rubinus (Boddaert) but which some authorities consider a distinct species, is, in both 

 sexes, wholly deep grayi.sh brown, the only sexual difference being that the males 

 are somewhat darker and more or less tingeil with a reddish hue, sometimes with touches 

 of bright red.

uncinate; gonys mucli longer than mandibular rami, faintly convex; 

 maxillary tomium straight, minutely but distinctly notched sub- 

 terminally. Nostril partly exposed, longitudinally oval, nonoper- 

 culate. Eictal bristles moderately to rather strongly developed; 

 feathers of chin and frontal antise with very distinct bristly points, 

 and malar antia3 with distinct antrorse, semierect setae. Wing mod- 

 erate to rather long, the longest primaries exceeding distal secondaries 

 by at least length of middle toe without claw, sometimes (in P. mexi- 

 canus) by much more than length of tarsus; seventh, eighth and 

 ninth primaries longest and about equal, tenth (outermost) equal to 

 fourth or fifth or intermediate between fifth and sixth. Tail not 

 longer (usually a little shorter) than distance from bend of wing to 

 end of distal secondaries, less than three-fourths to four-fifths as long 

 as wing, even or slightly rounded, the rectrices with broadly rounded 

 tip. Tarsus less than one-fifth (P. mexicanus) to much more than 

 one-fourth (P. nanus) as long as wing, slightly to decidedly longer 

 than middle toe with claw, slender, its scutellation typically exas- 

 pidean, but sometimes with a separate series of longitudinally hexago- 

 nal scutella along upper posterior margin of outer side of tarsus; 

 middle toe, without claw, decidedly more than half as long as tarsus, 

 its basal phalanx united to outer toe for at least half its length, to 

 inner toe for nearly the same distance; outer toe, without claw, reach- 

 ing to or beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the 

 inner toe slightly to decidedly shorter; hallux much shorter than 

 inner toe, slightly stouter, its claw shorter but sometimes nearly as 

 long as the digit; all the claws rather large, moderately curved, sharp. 



Coloration. — Adult males with whole of bushy-crested pileum and 

 entire under parts bright red (varying from scarlet to pinkish red or 

 orange), loral and auricular regions and upper parts plain grayish 

 l)rown (more or less dark) ; adult females wdth pileum grayish brown, 

 like rest of upper parts, under parts whitish tinged with red or orange 

 posteriorly and more or less streaked on breast with grayish; young 

 with feathers of upper parts margined with whitish. (One form, 

 believed to be a melanistic phase of P. rulmius Jieterurus, is entirely 

 plain grayisli Ih'owii in both sexes.) 



Nidijication. — Nest shallowly cup-shaped, composed of small twigs 

 and various soft materials compactly felted together, usually orna- 

 mented exteriorly with small lichens, usually saddled upon a horizon- 

 tal branch of a small tree. Eggs cream color (more or less deep) 

 heavily sjiotted aroimd larger end with dark brown, lilac-gray, etc. 



Range. — Southwestern border of United States (southern Texas to 

 Arizona) and southward through Mexico to Guatemala and British 

 Honduras; reappearing in South America, where distril)uted from 

 Colombia to Peru, Guiana, Brazil, and Argentena, and in Galapagos 

 Archipelago. (About five species.)

Quite possibly those of the above references which pertain to localities on the east- 

 ern slope of the Andes (eastern Peru, etc.) may belong to P. r. rubinus, or at least not to 

 P. r. heterurus; and it may also be that the Colombian bird is not the latter form. I 

 have neither the material nor time, however, necessary to the proper elucidation of 

 the extralimital forms of the genus.

An adult male in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History, from 

 Guayos, Venezuela, agrees minutely with Berlepsch and Hartert's description, and 

 the form is exceedingly well characterized. Other Venezuelan localities mentioned 

 by the authors cited are Puerto Cabello, Cumana, Ciudad Bolivar, Suapure, and La 

 Pricion. It would be interesting to know whether the Guiana bird is similar to the 

 Venezuelan bird or not.

 distinct purplish hue) ; lores and auricular region deep grayish brown, 

 confluent with that of neck, forming a longitudinal band separating 

 the red of pileum from that of malar region, chin, and throat; upper 

 tail-coverts dusky; wings (except lesser coverts) and tail dusky or 

 gra^ash black with deep grayish edgings, the middle and greater wing- 

 coverts and inner secondaries ("tertials") margined terminally with 

 pale brownish gray; outer web of outermost rectrix sometimes edged

Adult female. — Pileum, liindneck, auricular region, back, scapulars, 

 lesser wing-coverts, and rump grayish brown (hair brown), the first 

 narrowly streaked with darker; lores grayish passing into dull whitish 

 toward lorehead; upper tail-coverts dusky grayish brown; tail very 

 dark grayish brown or dusky; wings (except lesser coverts) deep 

 grayish brown (darker than color of back but much less so than tail) 

 with paler grayish brown or brownish gray edgings, the middle and 

 greater coverts and secondaries margined terminally with pale brown- 

 ish gray or whitish; malar region and under parts dull white, usually 

 passing into pale salmon color or pale orange-buff posteriorly, tlie 

 chest, sides, and flanks more or less distinctly streaked with grayish 

 brown; bill, iris, legs, and feet as in adult male; length (skins), 125- 

 138 (131.4); wing, 66-81.5 (77.6); tail, 47-59 (55.8); exposed cul-

Immature male {second year?). — Similar to the adult female, but 

 posterior under parts extensively suffused with salmon-pink or pale 

 orange-red. 



Young. — Above grayish brown, the feathers margined terminally 

 with pale buff or whitish, producing a more or less conspicuously 

 squamate effect; larger wing-coverts and inner secondaries conspicu-

Ten adult males from Arizona 



Three adult males from southern California 



One adult male from southern Lower California 



Seven adult males from eastern Mexico 



Three adult males from western Mexico 



Seven adult males from Yucatan

One adult female from southern Honduras (Segovia River) . 



Two and perhaps three geographic forms are strongly indicated by the series of speci- 

 mens examined; true P.r. mexicanus of Mexico in general and the adjacent parts of the 

 southwestern United States, a smaller form with larger and relatively broader bill and 

 less orange hue of red from Yucatan and Guatemala, and a still smaller form, with red 

 of under parts paler, from southern Honduras (Segovia River); but the material at 

 hand is not sufficient for their satisfactory definition.

 sure that I have given the best statement of the characters wherein it differs from the 

 Panama form. Doctor Sclater considers them as not separable; but as he also unites 

 with them M. xanthopygius, which is certainly distinct, I follow Count von Berlepsch 

 and others in separating subspecifically M. atricaudus Lawrence.

This form agrees with M. sulphureipygius, as compared with M. xanthopygus, in 

 having the tail dull black, the brighter yellow crown-patch, and barred under tail- 

 coverts; but the olive of the back, etc., is darker and much browner, the brown of 

 chest and sides not only darker, but much more extended, only a small portion of the 

 abdomen being yellowish. The ground color of the under tail-coverts is light cinna-

Small Tyrannitla3 (wing about 65-75 nun.) with rather short, 

 depressed triangular bill, conspicuous rictal bristles, long and pointed 

 wing, rather long and deeply eniarginate tail, feeble feet, imperfectly 

 exaspidean (qiiasi-holaspidean) tarsal envelope, pointed crest, and 

 plain coloration, the under parts tawny or ochraceous. (sometimes yel- 

 lowish on abdomen). 



Bill about half as long as head, broad and much depressed basally 

 (its width at frontal antise equal to at least half the length of exposed 

 culmen and about twice its depth at same ])oint), more or less broadly 

 triangular in vertical profile, with lateral outlines more or less concave 

 toward the attenuated tip of maxilla; exposed culmen shorter than 

 middle toe with claw, distinctly ridged, straight or very faintly con- 

 vex for most of its length, rather abruptly decurved terminally, the tip 

 of maxilla distinctly but finely uncinate ; gonys much longer than man-

 nearly straight, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril exposed,

longitudinally broadly oval, maririncd above and behind by rather 

 broad membrane. Rictal bristles very strongly developed, about half 

 as long as bill, the feathers of chin and frontal antise with distinct bristly 

 tips, and a tuft of stifT antrorse bristles at malar apex. Wing long and 

 pointed, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by nmch more 

 than length of tarsus; eighth and ninth, or seventh, eighth, and ninth 

 primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) equal to or longer than fifth. 

 Tail about six-sevenths to twelve-thirteenths as long as wing, deeply 

 emarginate, strongly divaricate. Tarsus one-fifth to a little more than 

 one-sixth as long as wing, slender, its scutellation quasi-holaspidean, 

 the outer edge of the acrotarsium not reaching to the posterior edge of 

 the tarsus (except sometimes for a very short distance below middle 

 portion), the posterior portion, especially above the middle, being 

 occupied by a series of distinct longitudinal scutella, which sometimes 

 do and sometimes do not meet the inner edge of the acrotarsium"; 

 middle toe, without claw, more than half as long as tarsus, but decid- 

 edly shorter than exposed culmen, its basal phalanx almost wholly 

 united to outer toe, about half united to inner toe ; outer toe, without 

 claw, reaching to beyond mi(klle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, 

 the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux about equal to inner toe, decid- 

 edly stouter, its claw shorter than the digit; all the claws rather 

 strongly curbed, very sharp, much compressed. 



Coloration. — Above plain cinnamon-olive to greenish olive, the 

 ])ileum, including pointed crest, more brown or dusky; wings dusky, 

 with two light brownish or fidvous bands; under parts ochraceous or 

 tawny, paler posteriorly, the abdomen sometimes yellov/ish. 



Nidification. — (Unknown ?) 



Range. — -Mexico to Peru. (Five species.) ^ 



o Occasionally the tarsal scutella are so nearly fused that this series of scutella is not 

 very distinctly defined , hut usually they are very obvious. The series does not extend 

 the full length of the tarsus, liut is interrupted by at least a part of one of the acrotarsial 

 scutella which extends entirely across the outer side of the tarsus. This same arrange- 

 ment of the tarsal envelope is seen, but developed to a less degree, in some species of 

 Blacicus, Myiochanes, and other genera, and is a decided step toward the holaspidean 

 tarsal envelope of some genera of alleged Cotingidse, showing how precarious the char- 

 acter really is as the main basis of family distinction.

Bill shorter than head, broad and moderately depressed at base, 

 its width at frontal antia? equal to or less than length of gonys (nearly 

 equal to the latter in M. virens, M. hrachy tarsus, and 21. pileatus) and 

 decidedly less to decidedly more than twice its depth at same point, 

 the lateral outlines nearly straight, converging gradually to the 

 attenuate and distinctly (sometimes strongly) uncmate tip of the 

 maxilla; exposed cidmen equal to or longer than middle toe with 

 claw (slightly shorter in M. pileatus, equal to tarsus in M. IracJiy- 

 tai'sus), distinctly to indistinctly ridged, nearly straight to near tip 

 where abruptly decurved ; gonys much longer than mandibular rami, 

 straight or very faintly convex; maxillary tomium straight, distinctly 

 notched subterminally. Nostril at least partly exposed, longitudi- 

 nally broadly oval,'* margmed above by very narrow (rarely distinct)

 as bill, or less) ; feathers of chin with distinct though small recurved 

 bristly tips, those of latero-frontal antise with larger arched setae; 

 malar apex with distinct antrorse bristles. Wing long and pointed, 

 the longest primaries exceeding distal secondaries by at least length

 only in 21. hrachy tarsus), more or less deeply emarginate, sometimes 

 slightly divaricate. Tarsus less than one-sixth (rarely nearly one- 

 fifth) as long as wing, its scutellation ty]:)ically exaspidean or (usually) 

 with a series of longitudinal scutella on upper posterior portion of 

 outer side of tarsus; middle toe usually more or less distinctly shorter

 specimens obtained on the Rio Truando, northern Colombia (not in Panama, how- 

 ever) by Wood. The specimen on which Cassin's "Sayornis ardosiacus" (Proc. Ac. 

 Nat. Sci. Phila., 1860, 144) is based, and which is in the collection of the U. S. National 

 Museum, does not, however, represent this species, but is Sayornis cineracca

 tail, 59.5-69.5 (66); exposed culmen, 12.5-14 (12.9); tarsus, 12.5-14

a Although convinced, from intimate personal acquaintance of both in life, that this 

 form and M. virens are specifically distinct I am at present iinal)le to give a better diag- 

 nosis. The differences are more easily seen than described ; but nevertheless it is often 

 difficult to identify specimens as one or the other without doubt. It is not at all 

 unlikely that this difficulty may be in part owing to the inclusion imder the name 

 richardsonii of what may be in reality two or three distinct forms; otherwise it is hard 

 to account for the unusual variations of coloration noticeable in a large series. While 

 appreciating and verifying the characters ascribed by Doctor Bishop to his supposed 

 northwestern form (Contopus richardsonii satiiratus), as compared with a large number 

 of other specimens, I am, unfortunately, unable to verify any geographic correlation 

 in the matter, these darker birds occurring almost everywhere outside the limits of the 

 supposed subspecies. At the same time there occur in Arizona and adjacent territory 

 many specimens which are decidedly paler and more uniform in color than are found 

 elsewhere, but here also these pale birds inhabit the same areas (possibly, however, not 

 exactly the same localities) as birds of the ordinary style. This pale form, if formally 

 recognized, would bear the name Myiochanes richardsonii veliti (Coues), but I do not 

 at present, at least, venture to recognize such a subspecies. The group is an exceed- 

 ingly diflicult one, which will require not only a very large amount of material, but 

 also much time and patience for its satisfactory elucidation.

MYIOCHANES BRACHYTARSUS (Sclater). 

 SHORT-LEGGED WOOD PEWEE. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Above plain olive, more or less darker 

 (sometimes sooty blackish) on pileum, lighter and more brownish 

 on rump and upper tail-coverts; tail dusky grayish brown, the outer 

 webs of rect rices passing into grayish olive on edges; wings dusk}^, 

 the middle and greater coverts margined terminally with pale gray 

 or grayish white (more or less buffy in immature birds), the sec- 

 ondaries edged (except basally) with the same; sides of head and 

 neck similar in color to back, etc., the lores at least partly grayish 

 white; chin, throat, median line of chest, median portion of breast, 

 abdomen, and under tail-coverts varying from pale yellow (nearly 

 primrose) to white,*^ the sides of chest and breast and sides plain 

 light grayish olive or gray; maxilla blackish brown or brownish 

 black; iris brown; legs and feet dusky brown or blackish. 



Young. — Somewhat like adults, but general color of upper parts 

 duller, less olivaceous, the feathers of pileum, hindneck, back, etc., 

 terminally margined or narrowly tipped with buffy whitish, those of 

 rump, together with upper tail-coverts and lesser wing-coverts, more 

 broadly tipped with pale cinnamon-buff, middle and greater coverts 

 broadly tipped with buff, cinnamon-buff, or pale cinnamon (forming 

 two conspicuous bands), and secondaries broadly edged (except 

 basally) with the same. 



Adult male.— Length (skins) , 125-145 (135) ; wing, 67.5-76.5 (72.9) ; 

 tail, 56-65.5 (61.1); exposed culmen, 13-15.5 (14.1); tarsus, 13-14.5 

 (13.7); middle toe, 7-8.5 (7.7).^^ 



« The specimens from Boquete cited imder this name by Mr. Bangs I find to be 

 referable to H. r. richardsonii. 



Some Costa Rican specimens which I have tentatively referred to this form are very 

 puzzling, and I believe that they are really something different. They have. a very 

 dark coloration, the pileum being nearly black. But for their very different wing- 

 formula, which is quite that of M. virens and 31. richardsonii, these specimens resemble 

 very closely darker colored examples of M. brachy tarsus. 



bin the bibliography of Dr. Sclater's publications (Bull. U. S. Nat. Mus., no. 49)^ 

 p. 85, the type is said to be in the Sclater collection in the British Museum, and the type 

 from " Mexico"; in Cat. Am. Birds, 1862, 231, the type locality is said to be Orizaba.

a Thirteen specimens. 



Specimens from Colombia, Venezuela, and Trinidad seem to be considerably grayer 

 above than those from Central America, and I doubt whether the South American 

 birds should be considered the same sul^specifically; but a very much larger series of 

 specimens than that which I have been able to examine will be, necessary to determine 

 the question of whether the South American and Central American birds are really 

 different as well as whether there is more than one form in Central America. 



&As stated above (in footnote) there is doubt as to \ho identity of South American 

 with Central American birds.

Range. — West Indies (Bahamas, Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Porto Rico, 

 Dominica, Guadeloupe, Grenada, Martinique, and Santa Lucia). 

 (Nine species.) 



If this group is to be recognized as generically distinct from Myio- 

 chanes it must be restricted to the West Indian species, for in no other 

 way can it be characterized ; even thus restricted its satisfactory defi- 

 nition is very difficult, and I have strong doubts as to whether its 

 distinctness can really be maintained. Possibly a better arrangement 

 would be to place the B. haliamensis , B. carihseus, B. hisjxinioJensis, 

 and B. palUdus in Myiochanes and make a new genus (the type of 

 Blacicus being B. carihseus, and therefore if tliis procedure be adopted 

 Blacicus becomes a synonym of Myiochanes) for B. hlancoi, B. hrun- 

 neicapUlus, and B. latirostris, the precise relationships of B . fiaviventris 

 being as yet uncertain.

Small Tvrannidae (wing about 57-70 mm.) with basal phalanx of 

 middle toe united to outer toe for less than its entire length, acrotar- 

 sial scutella very distinct, bill much shorter than head, with distinctly 

 convex lateral outlines, outermost (tenth) primary equal to second 

 or third, tail much shorter than distance from bend of wing to end of 

 secondaries, no yelloAv on rump, but crown with a concealed spot 

 of yellow or orange-rufous and wing with two fulvous bands. 



Bill much shorter than head, depressed and broad at base, its width 

 at nostrils equal to about half the length of exposed culmen and rather 

 less than twice its de]>th at same point, its lateral outlines distinctly 

 convex beyond the middle, then more rapidly converging to the tip; 

 exposed culmen equal to or longer than middle toe without claw, dis- 

 tinctly (almost shar])ly) ridged, straight for most of its length, rather 

 abruptly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla minutely uncinate; 

 gonys nnich longer than mandibular rami, faintly convex; maxillary 

 tomium straight, distinctly but minutely notched subterminally. 

 Nostril partly exposed, longitudinally oval or elliptical, margined 

 above by narrow membrane. Rictal bristles well developed, at least 

 two- thirds as long as bill, the feathers of chin and frontal antia? with 

 very distinct curved bristly points. Wing moderate, rather pointed, 

 the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by about length of ex- 

 posed culmen; eighth or seventh and eighth primaries longest, ninth 

 e([ual to or longer than iifth, tenth (outermost) equal to second or 

 third. Tail nine-tenths as long as wing (M. nxvius) to only a little 

 more than four-fifths as long (If. flavicans), slightly rounded or 

 double-rounded. Tarsus about one-fourth to two-sevenths as long as 

 wing, rather stout, its scutellation typically exaspidean, with acro- 

 tarsial divisions very distinct; middle toe, without claw, more than

half as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx united for less than its entire 

 length to outer toe, for barely half its length to inner toe; outer toe, 

 without claw, reaching to or beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of 

 middle toe, the inner toe slightly but decidedly shorter; hallux about 

 as long as inner toe, but decidedly stouter, its claw^s shorter than the 

 digit; all the claws rather large, strongly curved, sharp. 



Coloration. — Above plain brown, olive, or olive-green, the crown 

 with a concealed spot of yellow or orange-rufous, the wing with two 

 fulvous bands; beneath buffy whitish, streaked on chest, etc., with 

 brown, or yellowish shaded on chest and sides with olive. 



Nidification. — Nest (of M. nsevius) placed in a bush or low tree, 

 open above, compact, composed of various soft materials, lined with 

 feathers, etc. Eggs cream color or creamy white, spotted with reddish 

 brown, mostly in circle around larger end. 



Range. — Panama to Peru, Argentina and Guiana. (About eleven 

 species, including subspecies, all but one of them extralimital to the 

 present work.)

 that they agree much better with the latter than with Colombian specimens, which I 

 am not able to distinguish from examples of the species from other parts of South 

 America (excepting, of course, those from Argentina).

 moderately curved, sharp, rather larger. 



Coloration. — Above plain gray, grayish brown, buffy brown, olive 

 or olive-green, the pileum sometimes black; wings dusky with paler 

 edgings and with two more or less distinct paler bands; under parts 

 yellowish or whitish, shaded on chest and sides with gray, olive or

Nidification. — Nest open above, more or less bulky or else very 

 compact, composed of various vegetable substances and lined with 

 softer materials, and placed in trees or bushes; sometimes composed 

 outwardly of soft green mosses and placed in rocky banks near water

EMPIDONAX MINIMUS (Baird). 

 LEAST FLYCATCHER. 



Closely similar in coloration to E. tmillii alnorum, but decidedly 

 smaller, and tail emarginate instead of even or slightly rounded. 



Adults (sexes alike). — ^ Above plain brownish olive, the feathers of 

 pileiim darker centrally; tail grayish brown, the rectrices passing 

 into light brownish olive on edges; wings dusky, the middle and 

 greater coverts broadly tipped with pale grayish brown or brownish 

 gray, sometimes nearly white on tips of greater coverts, forming 

 two distinct bands; the secondaries edged (except basally) \\dth the 

 same or with dull yellowish white; a broad dull wliite or yello\\-ish 

 white orbital ring; lores dull whitish suffused with dusky, especiall}^ 

 near anterior angle of eye; rest of side of head and sides of neck 

 similar in color to upper parts, gradually fading below into dull white 

 or grayish yellowish wliite of chin and throat; rest of under parts 

 dull white, more or less tinged with pale (primrose) yellow posteriorly, 

 the chest and sides more or less strongly shaded with pale grayish 

 brown or browjiish gray, this deepest on sides of chest and sides of 

 breast; axillars and under wing-coverts ver}" pale 3'ellow or yellowish 

 white ; inner webs of remiges edged with pale dull buffy or dull buffy 

 white; maxilla dusky brown, mandible pale brownish; iris brown; 

 legs and feet blackish brown or brownish black. 



Young. — Similar to adults, but wing-])ands diUl buff, and gray of 

 chest and sides more brownish. 



« I have not been able to examine in this connection the type of this supposed 

 species, but the principal character ('outer web of the exterior rectrix white") is one 

 which occasionally occurs in E. traillii alnorum.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 565 



EMPIDONAX HAMMONDII (Xantus). 



HAMMOND'S FLYCATCHER. 



Similar to E. minimus, but wing, tail, and middle toe much longer, 

 bill much narrower, and coloration of under parts darker and more 

 uniform. Similar, also, to E. wrightii, but wing-formula very differ- 

 ent (tenth primary longer than fifth, instead of shorter), bill much 

 smaller, tail averagmg decidedly shorter (but wing slightly longer), 

 tarsus decidedly shorter, and coloration of under parts more uniform. 



Adults (sexes alil-e), white-hellied jyJiase.'^ — Pileum and hindneck 

 didl deep brownish gray (nearly mouse gray), the back, scapulars, 

 lesser wing-coverts, rump, and upper tail-coverts similar, but decid- 

 edly more olive; tail deep grayish brown, the outer webs of rectrices 

 passing into light grayish olive or olive-gray on edges, the outer web 

 of lateral rectrix pale olive-grayish; primaries deep grayish brown, 

 narrowly and indistinctly edged with lighter grayish; middle and 

 greater coverts dusky, broadly tipped with pale gray or dull grayish 

 white (forming two distinct bands) ; secondaries dusky edged (except 

 basally) with dull whitish; an orbital ring of dull white, broader 

 posteriorly and below; lores grayish white anteriorly, largely (some- 

 times mostly) dusky posteriorly; rest of sides of head and sides of neck 

 similar in color to pileum and hindneck, but slightly paler, gradually 

 fading below into the dull grayish white of median portion of chin 

 and throat; chest and sides of breast pale gray, gradually fading on 

 sides and flanks; rest of under parts dull white, yellowish white, or 

 very pale primrose yellow; axillars and under wing-coverts pale prim- 

 rose yellow or yellowish white, the feathers pale grayish basally; 

 inner webs of remiges edged with pale grayish buffy; maxilla brown- 

 ish black or blackish brown, mandible pale brownish (more or less 

 deep); iris brown; legs and feet blackish brown or brownish black. 



Adults, yelloiv-helUed phase. — Similar to the whitish bellied ])hase, 

 but more olivaceous (sometimes brownish olive) above, chest and 

 sides of breast olive or buffy olive, and abdomen, etc., primrose or 

 sulpluo" yellow. 



Young. — Essentially like whitish-bellied adults, but color of upper 

 parts grayish brown, rather than olive, wmg-bands light buffy, and 

 marginal under wing-coverts buffy. 



Adult 7/ia/6.— Length (skins), 120-135 (1:24); wing, 68-74 (71.3); 

 tail, 55-61 (57.9); exposed culmen, 10-11 (10.7); tarsus, 15.5-17.5 

 (16.2); middle toe, 9-10 (9.2).^ 



«As in E. vrightii, the two color phases of this species seem to be mainly inde- 

 pendent of season. A majority of specimens do not represent either phase in its 

 extreme differentiation, 1)nt are variously intermediate. 



f> Twelve specimens. 




566 BULLETIN 50, FNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Adult'female.— Length (skins), 115-131 (123); wing, 64.5-70 (67.9); 

 tail, 52.5-57 (55.1); exposed culmen, 9.5-11 (10.3); tarsus, 15-16

Breeding in mountains of western North America (in Transition 

 and Canadian life-zones), north to southeastern Alaska (Skagway; 

 White Pass; Glacier; 15 miles below Selwyn River, and thence to 

 Yukon Valley (Alaska and Northwest Territory) and southwestern 

 Athabasca (Little Slave Lake), south to Colorado and C-alifornia

b Extreme eastern alleged breeding records are Fort Keogh, eastern Montana (Thorne,

 Orn. Club, v, 1880, 184; Agersborg, Auk, ii, 1885, 283). Both these localities are on 

 the Great Plains, a country exceedingly different from that in which the species is 

 certainly known to breed, and there is probably an error in these records. Doubtless 

 the error is one of identification; for the young bird referred to by Captain Thorne, 

 now (with the rest of his collection) in the U. S. National Museum, is E. ynimmns and 

 not E. hammondii. Probably all these records pertain to E. minimus.

« While strongly yellowish examples of this species are apparently more common 

 in autumn and winter, they are almost equally so in spring and summer, ai^ I am 

 convinced that, as in E. hammondii, the two phases are really a sort of dichromatism.

EMPIDONAX GRISEUS Brewster. 

 GRAY FLYCATCHER. 



Similar to E. tDrightii, but wing averaging decidedly longer, tail 

 shorter, ])il] longer and relatively narrower, and coloration much 

 grayer above. 



Adults {sexes alike) in spring and summer."' — Above plain grayish 

 olive or olive-gray, more decidedly gray on neck; tail deep graj^ish 

 brown, the outer webs of rectrices passing into grayisli olive or olive- 

 gray on edges, the outer web of lateral rectrix dull white or grayish 

 white; wings deep grayish l)rown, the middle and greater coverts 

 rather broadly tipped with ])ale gray (sometimes grayish white on 

 secondary coverts), forming two distinct bands, the secondaries edged 

 (except basall}^ with grayish white; primaries and greater coverts 

 narrowly edged with pale gray; an orbital ring of dull white; lores 

 dull white, intermixed with dusky; rest of sides of head and sides of 

 neck similar in color to upper parts, but paler and (especially sides 

 of neck) grayer, gradually fading below into grayish white on chin 

 and throat; chest and sides of breast pale brownish gray, gradually 

 fading out on flanks; rest of under parts white, usually faintly tinged 

 with primi"ose yellow; axillars and under wing-coverts 3^ellowish 

 white or pale prinu'ose yellow; inner webs of remiges edged with very 

 pale graj^ish huffy; maxilla brownish black or blackish brown; man- 

 dible pale lirownish (pinkish or lilaceous in life?) usually with ter- 

 minal portion more or less extensively dusky; iris brown; legs and 

 feet brownish black or blackish brown. 



Adults in autumn and winter. ^ — Similar to the spring and summer 

 plumage, but upper parts more decidedly olive and white of under 

 parts replaced by pale primrose yellow. 



Young. — Similar to spring and simimer adults, but wing-bands pale 

 buff instead of gray or grayish white; upper parts brownish gray or 

 grayish brown rather than olive; gray of chest more ])rownish, and, 

 white of under parts tinged with pale brownish buff. 



Adult mrt?^.— Length (skins), 125-142 (133); wing, 68.5-76.5 (72.6); 

 tail, 57.5-64 (60.S); exposed culmen, 12-13.5 (12.9); tarsus, 17-20.5 

 (18.3); middle toe, 8.5-10 (9.5).'^ 



o Wliile the two phases of coloration (the one with lower parts white and that with 

 under parts primrose yellow) are no more different in this form than in E. wrightii, 

 they seem to be mainly seasonal, a large majority of those which are white, or very faintly 

 tinged with yellow beneath, being spring and summer birds while those decidedly 

 yellowish beneath were nearly all obtained in autumn or winter. 



b Specimens in this plumage are occasionally taken at other seasons, and vice versa. 



c Eighteen specimens.

c Although Mr. Salvin has stated (Cat. Birds Strickland Coll., 1882, 314) that his 

 examination of the type of Tyrannula ajfinis Swainson showed it to be the same as the 

 species later described as Empidonax fulvipectus by Mr. Lawrence, I can not, under 

 the circumstances, accept this determination until reexamination of the former and 

 comparison with examples of the present species, E. pulverius, and E. trepidus (which 

 are all closely related) establishes its correctness. It should be taken into consider- 

 ation that, as one of the authors of the Biologia Centrali- Americana, Mr. Salvin not 

 only confounds the present species with E. puhenus but, what is still more to the 

 point , fails tt) recognizee the difference between such very distinct forms as E. dijlicilis 

 and E. bairdi, it is (nit irely possible he erred in the identification of Tyrannula ajinis 

 with E. fulvipectus. At any rate, it seems to me best to retain the latter name until it 

 is satisfactorily shown that E. aj/inis should rej^lace it.

I have considerable difficulty in separating this form*satisfactorily from E. d. difficilis, 

 from which it certainly is not more than subspecifically distinct, birds from the 

 extreme northern portion of Lower California and some of those from San Diego County, 

 California, being unmistakable intergrades, as are also some of those from Arizona and 

 Sonora. In fact, beyond the duller and grayer or less olive coloration of upper parts 

 and less pronounced yellowness of the under surface, comparing specimens in corre- 

 sponding condition of plumage, I can find no differences that are constant or reasonably 

 characteristic. The differences appear to be more pronounced in the young (first 

 plumage) than in adults, those of E. d. cineritius being lighter and much less olive 

 (more buffy grayish brown) above and decidedly paler (dull white or buffy white — not 

 distinctly yellowish) beneath.

Nidijication. — Nest open above, bulky, composed of various vege- 

 table materials, usually covered outside with green moss, placed in 

 crevices or on shelves of rocky banks or cliffs, in culverts, on beams 

 or braces underneath bridges, porches, in outbuildings, etc., sometimes 

 among roots of uprooted trees, and other similar places. Eggs white, 

 immaculate or sparingly speckled with brown. 



Range. — Northern North America to Peru and Bolivia. (About 

 eight species and subspecies.)

SAYORNIS NIGRICANS NIGRICANS (Swainson). 

 BLACK PHCEBE. 



Adults (sexes alike) . — General color plain dark sooty slate, the head 

 darker (almost black), the back, scapulars, rump, and upper tail- 

 coverts brownish slate color; abdomen, anal region, and under tail- 

 coverts white, the last sometimes (in all specimens from central, 

 eastern, and southern Mexico, and some from Lower California)

BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



frequently streaked mesially (more or less broadly) with dusky;" 

 middle wing-coverts broadly tipped or terminally margined (more or 

 less distinctly) wdtli brownish gray; greater coverts edged with brown- 

 ish gray and tipped with the same or paler brownish gray; secondaries 

 edged wath pale brownish gray or dull white; outer web of lateral 

 rectrix edged (more or less broadly) with white; axillars and under 

 wing-coverts dark sooty gray or brownish slate, their outer webs 

 mostly white and inner webs extensively white at tip; inner webs of 

 remiges edged with pale brownish gray; bill black, the mandible 

 more brownish, especially toward base; iris brown; legs and feet 

 brownish black. 



Young. — Similar to adults, but general color more sooty, the 

 feathers of lower back, hinder scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts 

 indistinctly tipped with pale brownish; wing-coverts tipped with 

 cumamon or light rusty; w^hite of under parts suffused along border 

 with brown or rusty. 



Adult maif.— Length (skins), 152-181 (165); wing, 84-96 (91.5); 

 tad, 71-84 (79.9); exposed culmen, 14-16.5 (15.5); tarsus, 17.5-19.5 

 (18.4); middle toe, 9.5-11 (10.5).^ 



Adult female.— ljej\gi\\ {skms) , 147-176 (160); wing, 81-93.5 (86.5); 

 tail, 68-80 (74.9); exposed culmen, 14-16 (14.9); tarsus, 15.5-18 

 (17.4); middle toe, 9.5-11 (lO.S).*^ 



fl So far as the collection of the U. S. National Museum, including that of the Bio- 

 logical Survey, is concerned, the difference in coloration of the under tail-coverts 

 between specimens from California, Arizona, and western Mexico on the one hand, 

 and those from central, eastern, and southern Mexico on the other, mentioned by Mr. 

 Nelson (Auk, xvii, 1900, 124, 125) certainly exists, with remarkable uniformity; and 

 were it not for Mr. Brewster's later observations on the subject (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 

 xli, 1902, 119) I would unhesitatingly adopt Mr. Nelson's division of the northern repre- 

 sentatives of the species into two forms, S. n. nigricans and S. n. semiatra, since in the 

 series examined the difference is both conspicuous and str'ctly geographic. 



b Twenty specimens. 



c Sixteen specimens.

 (Type, Myiobius magnirostris Gray.) 



Similar to Myiarclius, but tarsus relatively much longer (a little 

 less than one-third as long as wing, about equal to length of bill from 

 rictus), lateral outlines of l)ill not contracted terminally, and tenth 

 (outermost) primary much shorter (shorter than secondaries). 



Bill nearly as long as head, narrowly triangular or wedge-shaped in 

 vertical profile, its width at frontal antitie equal to about half the 

 length of exposed culmen and decidedly less than twice its depth at 

 same point, its lateral outlines straight to near tip of the rather 

 obtusely pointed maxilla; exposed culmen equal to or slightly 

 longer than middle toe with claw, distinctly ridged, straight to near 

 tip where rather abruptly decurved, the tip of maxilla minutely and 

 rather obtusely uncinate; gonys much longer than mandibular rami, 

 faintl}' convex; maxillary tomium nearly straight, minutely notched 

 subterminally. Nostril exposed, broadly oval or nearly circular, 

 midway between culmen and tomium, opening laterally. Rictal 

 bristles distinct but slender, the feathers of chin with indistinct, those 

 of malar and frontal antise wdth distinct, bristly points. Wing mod- 

 erate, much rounded, the longest primaries exceeding distal second- 

 aries by slightly less than length of exposed culmen; sixth, seventh, 

 and eighth primaries longest, ninth equal to fifth, tenth (outermost) 

 shorter than secondaries. Tail about nine-tenths as long as wing, 

 slightly double-rounded, the rectrices moderately broad, with broadly 

 rounded tip. Tarsus long and slender, twice as long as middle toe 

 without claw, a little less than one-third as long as wing, its scutella- 

 tion typically exaspidean but wdth a separate series of longitudinal 

 scutella along upper posterior margin of outer side of tarsus, the 

 acrotarsial divisions very distinct ; basal phalanx of middle toe united 

 to outer toe for nearly its whole length, to inner toe for about half its 

 length; outer toe, without claw, reaching to middle of subterminal 

 phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe distinctly shorter; hallux shorter 

 than inner toe but distinctly stouter, its claw about as long as the 

 digit; all the claws rather long, moderately curved, sharp. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive, browner on pileum, the wings and 

 tail dusky grayish brown with paler edgings (these rufescent on inner 

 webs of inner rectrices) , the middle and greater wing-coverts broadly 

 tipped with light brownish gray; beneath plain pale gray anteriorly, 

 pale yellow posteriorly. 



Nidijication. — Nest in holes of arborescent cacti, composed of small 

 twigs, fine grass stems, hair, feathers, etc. Eggs unknown. 



Range. — Galapagos Archipelago. (Monot3^ic.)

 dusky, with paler grayish brown edgings, the inner webs of rectrices 

 (except middle and one or two outer pairs) more or less broadly edged 

 with cinnamon-rufous or pale cinnamon; middle and greater wing- 

 coverts broadly tipped with pale grayish brown or pale buffy grayish, 

 forming two more or less distinct bands, the secondaries broadly 

 edged with same; sides of head and neck similar in color to back, 

 etc., but rather lighter, gradually fading below into the pale gray 

 of chin, throat, and chest; lower eyelid whitish; lores mixed whitish 

 and dusky gray; under parts of body and under tail-coverts pale 

 (primrose) yellow, the upper breast (at least laterally) tinged with 

 grayish; axillars and under wing-coverts pale grayish primrose 

 yellow; inner webs of remiges broadly edged with very pale cinna- 

 mon-buify; bill blackish brown, the mandible paler brown basally;

 anlise also with well-developed bristly points. Wing moderate, 

 rather pointed, the longest primaries exceeding distal secondaries 

 by more than length of middle toe without claw, sometimes by

 terminally, with broadly rounded tip. Tarsus longer (sometimes 

 much longer) than middle toe with claw, less than one-fifth to more 

 than one-fourth as long as wing, its scutellation typically exaspidean 

 but with a separate series of longitudinal scutella (more or less dis- 

 tinct) along upper posterior portion of outer side of tarsus, the acro- 

 tarsial divisions very distinct; middle toe, without claw, not more 

 (usually much less) than half as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx 

 united to outer toe for much the greater part of its length, to inner 

 toe for about half its length; outer toe, without claw, reaching to 

 about middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe 

 slightly shorter; hallux slightly shorter than inner toe, not conspic- 

 uously stouter, its claw about as long as the digit; all the claws rather

After carofiilly comparing breeding specimens from Florida with those from more 

 northern localities I am unable to find differences sufficient, in my judgment, to war- 

 rant their subspecific separation. The difference in size of the bill, while fairly con- 

 stant, is by no means conspicuous, and is not, so far as I am able to see, accompanied by 

 any difference of coloration.

c Specimens from the island of Tobago certainly are not refei-able to M. tyranmdus; 

 but unfortunately those examined by me are not in sufiiciently good plumage to enalilo 

 me to determine whether they are the same as the present form. Tobago specimens 

 are much darker as well as larger than mainland examples (M. tyrannulus).

 CURASAO CRESTED FLYCATCHER. 



Similar to M. tyrannulus, but tarsus longer, wings and tail shorter, 

 bill black, and coloration of upper parts paler; length, 185; wing, 

 86.4-88.9; tail, 88.9; culmen [ exposed ?] , 17.8-20.3; tarsus, 19-21. 6.^^ 



a I am unable to verify, from comparison of a single specimen from St. Christopher, 

 the color differences claimed in the original description. 



b One specimen, from St. Christopher. 



I refer doubtfully to this form, a series of Myiarchus from the island of Barbuda. 

 These agree with the specimen of M. o. berlepschi from St. Christopher in small size, 

 but are apparently slightly paler and more olivaceous in color of back, et(;., and the 

 upper tail-coverts are in all (five adults) strongly tinged with cinnamon or rusty. 

 The yellow of under parts is also brighter and clearer (more so even than in M. o. oberi) , 

 approaching sulphur yellow. Average measurements are as follows: Adult males: 

 Length (skins), 178-196 (189); wing, 88.5-95 (92.6); tail, 77-84.5 (82.3); exposed 

 culmen, 20-22.5 (21.2); tarsus, 23.5-24.5 (24.1); middle toe, 13-14 (13.5). Adult 

 female: Length (skin), 192; wing, 89.5; tail, 79; exposed culmen, 21; tarsus, 24.5; 

 middle toe, 13.5.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 625 



MYIARCHUS CINERASCENS CINERASCENS (Lawrence). 

 ASH-THROATED FLYCATCHER. 



Similar to M. mexicanus mexicanus, but much smaller (except 

 wing), bill relatively much smaller, color of back either grayer or 

 browner (less olive), yellow of under parts paler, and inner webs of 

 lateral rectrices with cinnamon-rufous occupying nearly the whole 

 width of web but not extending to tip (except in some females). 



Adult male. — Pileum broccoli brown or hair brown, the feathers 

 darker centrally; rest of upper parts plain grayish brown (more 

 brownish in some winter specimens), the hindneck more grayish; tail 

 deep or dusky grayish brown, the outer webs of rectrices edged with 

 paler, that of outermost rectrix decidedly paler, sometimes approach- 

 ing dull white; inner webs of rectrices (except middle pair) cinnamon- 

 rufous, this extending quite to shaft for greater part, but gradually 

 contracted terminally and on at least the lateral rectrix cut off from 

 tip by a terminal or subterminal area of dusky grayish brown; wings 

 dusky grayish brown, the middle and greater coverts broadl}^ tipped 

 with pale grayish brown, pale buffy brown, or dull wdiitish, secondaries 

 edged with pale buffy brownish or dull whitish, and primaries edged 

 (except terminally) with cinnamon-rufous; sides of head and neck 

 gray, slightly tinged with brown, especially on auricular region, 

 gradually fading below into much paler gray (about no. 10) of malar 

 region, chin, throat, chest, and upper breast, the rest of under parts 

 very pale yellow, deeper (primrose yellow) posteriorly; axillars and 

 under wing-coverts primrose yellow; inner webs of remiges edged 

 with pale cinnamon-rufous; bill brownish black to dark horn color, 

 usually more brownish basally; iris brown; legs and feet black; 

 length (skins), 187-207 (197); wing, 98.5-104 (100.9); tail, 88.5-97 

 (92.5); exposed culmen, 18-20(19.1); tarsus, 21.5-24 (22.8) ; middle 

 toe, 12-13.5 (12.9).« 



Adult fe nude. — Similar to the adult male, but usually with the dusky 

 terminal or subterminal space on inner web of lateral rectrices smaller, 

 as a rule not entriely crossing the web and sometimes not extending 

 halfway across; length ( skins) , 174-205(189); wing, 92-100.5 (95.5) ; 

 tail, 84-92 (87.1); exposed culmen, 17-19.5 (18.6); tarsus, 22-23.5 

 (22.6); middle toe, 12.5-13.5 (12.8)." 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but pileum cinnamon-brown or 

 wood brown, rectrices cinnamon-rufous with a median streak of 

 grayish brown, upper tail-coverts strongly tinged with cinnamon- 

 rufous, outer webs of remiges mostly bulTy cinnamon-rufous, other 

 wing-markings tinged with cinnamon-buff, and yellow of under parts 

 much paler (yellowish white).

 (outer) secondaries; primaries broadly edged (except terminally) 

 with cinnamon-rufous ; greater coverts narrowly edged with pale gray- 

 ish brown; sides of head and neck gray, slightly tinged with light 

 olive-brown, gradually fading below into the pale gray (about no. 10)

I am very doubtful whether this supposed form is really distinct 

 from M. n. nuttingi. The only difference is in dimensions, and it is dif- 

 ficult in the case of some specimens to decide which form they should 

 l)e referred to; and, what is especially significant, the range of each is 

 practically the same.

Bill about as long as head or slightly shorter, stout, but variable 

 in relative width and depth, its width at anterior end of nostrils some- 

 times (in M. hairdi) less than half the distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla and equal to its depth at same point; sometimes (in M. 

 clirysocephalus and M. hemickrysus) its width at anterior end of nostrils 

 equal to much more than twice the distance mentioned, and conspicu- 

 ously greater than its depth at same point; its lateral outlines 

 straight {M. hairdi, M. luteiventris) or strongly convex subterminally, 

 the tip of maxilla rather abruptly contracted; exposed culmen about 

 as long as tarsus (sometimes decidedly less, more rarely decidedly 

 more), distinctly ridged, straight or very nearly so for most of its 

 length, strongly (sometimes abruptly) decurved terminally, the tip 

 of maxilla more or less strongly uncinate; gonys decidedly longer 

 than mandibular rami (but less than twice as long), straight or very 

 slightly convex; mandiV)ular tomium straight or sometimes slightly 

 convex anteriorly, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril more 

 or less exposed, nearly circular ( ilf. lairdi, M. lute/wentris) , obliquely 

 oval (J/, solitarius, M. maculatus) or longitudinally oval (M. cliryso- 

 cephalus, M. hemichrysus) . Rictal bristles strong, the feathers of 

 chin, malar antiie, and frontal antiiie with distinct bristh" tips, the last 

 arching over nostrils. Wing rather long, pointed, the longest pri- 

 maries exceeding distal secondaries by much more than length of 

 tarsus; seventh, eighth, seventh and eighth, or eighth and ninth pri- 

 maries longest, the tenth (outermost) slightly shorter than fourth to 

 nearly as long as sixth. Tail three-fourths to five-sixths as long as 

 wing (longer than distance from bend of wing to end of distal seconda- 

 ries), even, slightly rounded, slightly double-rounded, or slightl}' emar- 

 ginate, the rectrices of even width and with broadly rounded tip. 

 Tarsus equal to or barely longer than middle toe with claw (decidedly 

 longer in M. hairdi), sometimes very slightly shorter, its scutellation 

 typicall}?^ exaspidean, without separate series of scutella on upper 

 posterior portion of outer side of tarsus, the acrotarsial divisions 

 distinct; basal phalanx of middle toe united for greater part of its 

 length to outer toe, for half its length, or less, to inner toe; outer 

 toe, without claw, reaching to or beyond middle of subterminal 

 phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe more or less distinctly shorter; 

 hallux about as long as inner toe, not conspicuously stouter, its claw 

 shorter than the digit; all the claws rather large, moderatel}'^ curved, 

 moderately sharp and compressed. 



Coloration. — (1) Conspicuously streaked, above and below, the 

 upper tail-coverts and tail mostly rufous or broadly edged with 

 rufous. (2) Plain brown above, the upper tail-coverts and tail and 

 outer webs of remiges mostly rufous ; under parts plain straw yellow, 

 passing into grayish on throat. (3) Plain olive above, the upper 

 tail-coverts, rectrices, and remiges mereh^ margined with rufous; 

 under parts sulphur yellow, passing into brownish or buffy white on

throat, the chest obsoletely streaked with ohve. (All the species 

 with a concealed patch of yellow on crown, exce])t in young, a whitish 

 or pale dull bully superciliary stripe and, except in M. hairdi, a similar 

 malar stripe, and a dusky loral stri}>e extendini^; to and includino; the 

 latero-fnmtal antia?.) 



Xul if cation. — Xest (t)f .1/. luteiventris) in lioles of trees, composed 

 of small twiujs, dry leaf-stems, etc. Es;gs huffy, blotched and spotted, 

 chiefly roimd larger end, with deep purplish brown, lavender, etc. 



Range. — Southwestern border of Ignited ^States (Arizona) to Peru, 

 Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, etc. (About six species and sub- 

 species.) 



Notwithstanding the great ditl'erence in form of the bill between 

 M. cJirysocephalus and 21. hemichrysus on the one hand and M. hairdi 

 and M. lutewentris on the other, the difference is so nearl}^ bridged 

 over b}'" tlie intermediate structure of the bill in M. solitarius and M. 

 maculatus that, in the absence of other characters, I am not able to 

 recognize a genus Hypennitres Cabanis. The only alternative, in fact, 

 would be to have four genera instead of one.

l)y much more than length of tarsus; seventh, eighth, and ninth pri- 

 maries longest and about equal, the tenth (outermost) slightly shorter 

 than fifth. Tail- less than three-fourths as long as wing, slightly 

 emarginate, the rectrices firm, of uniform width, with broadly rounded 

 tip. Tarsus more than one-sixth as long as wing, its scutellation 

 typically exaspidean, without separate series of scutella on upper 

 ])osterior portion of outer side of tarsus; middle toe, with claw, much 

 longer than tarsus, its basal phalanx united to outer toe for greater

 claw, reaching to about or a little beyond middle of subterminal pha- 

 lanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter; hallux a little 

 shorter than inner toe, not conspicuously stouter, its claw shorter 

 than the digit; all the claws rather strongly curved, sharp. 



Coloration. — Above plain olive, the crown dusk}^, surrounded by a 

 conspicuous ring of white and (in adults) with a concealed yellow or 

 rufous patch; a broad band of black on side of head; under parts 

 clear gamboge or lemon yellow, the throat white.

KEY TO THE SUBSPECIES OF MEGARYNCHt'S PITANGUA.'> 



a. Pileum blackish or dark sooty; back, etc., decidedly greenish olive, sometimes 

 almost olive-green. 

 b. Smaller (wing averaging 114. G in male, 111.9 in female); color of back, etc., duller 

 olive. (Colombia to Cayenne, southern Brazil, Argentina, etc.) 



Megarynchus pitangua pitangua (extralimital) c 



« I can not agree with Messrs. Salvador! and Festa (see Boll. Mus. ZooL, etc., Torino, 

 XV, no. 362, 1899, 10) in their reference of Scaphorhynchus chrysocephalus Tschudi to 

 this genus. If not referable to Myiodynastes (see p. 655), it should be placed in a sepa- 

 rate genus, Hypermitres Cabanis, of which it is the type. 



b Owing to the insufficient number of South American examples available for com- 

 parison at the present time, I am unable to do more than roughly separate the South 

 American birds of this species as a whole from those found in Central America and 

 Mexico. There seem to be at least two, and probably three, well-characterized geo- 

 graphic forms in South America, namely: (1) The true M. pitangua of eastern Brazil, 

 etc. ; (2) M. pitangua chrysogaster, of western Ecuador, of which, however, I have not 

 been able to examine a specimen; and (3) a very dark-colored form found in Paraguay, 

 of which there is a single example in the U. S. National Museum.

 wing-coverts, pure, bright lemon or canary yellow; bill black, the man- 

 dible usually more brownish basally; iris brown; legs and feet dusky 

 (in dried skins). 



Young. — Essentially like adults but without yellow or tawny on 

 crown, the median portion of pileum often squamated with pale gray- 

 ish buffy; feathers of back, etc., margined with paler; wing-coverts 

 and upper tail-coverts margined with cinnamon, cinnamon-buif, or 

 whitish; rectrices and secondaries broadly edged and terminally 

 margined with cinnamon or cinnamon-bufi", becoming whitish on 

 inner secondaries.

a If any approximation to general accuracy in the sexing of specimens has been 

 attempted by collectors, it is quite certain that the variation in the color of the con- 

 cealed crown-patch (which may be either pure canary or lemon yellow or rufous-tawny) 

 is not due to difference of sex. It seems to be either a purely individual variation or 

 else due to difference of age.

 times its depth at same point), with longer gonys (very nearly twice to 

 more than twice as long as mandibular rami), longer tail (much more 

 than four-fifths as long as wing), much longer tenth (outermost) 

 primary (longer than fourth instead of equal to or shorter than 

 first), more exposed nostrils, more scant and conspicuously bristly 

 latero-f rontal feathers, larger rictal bristles, and very different style of 

 coloration (under parts grayish white instead of yellow, no wliite

 narrow membrane. Rictal bristles strongly developed, with distinct 

 lateral barbules on basal portion; feathers of chin with long, recurved 

 bristly points, those of latero-frontal antiae conspicuously bristly, 

 arching over nostril, and those of malar antia^ conspicuoush' bristly, 

 antrorse, or semierect. Wing moderate, rounded, the longest pri- 

 maries exceeding distal secondaries by length of tarsus, or more; 

 eighth or seventh and eightli primaries longest, ninth equal to or 

 longer than sixth (sometimes longer than seventh), the tenth (outer- 

 most) longer than fourth. Tail decidedly to much more than four- 

 fifths as long as wing (decidedh^ longer than distance from bend of 

 wing to end of distal secondaries), decidedly rounded, the rectrices 

 broadly rounded at tip. Tarsus shorter than middle toe with claw, 

 one-fifth to more than one-fifth as long as wing, its scutellation exas- 

 pidean, but the outer portion of the acrotarsium sometimes broken 

 up along the posterior margin of the tarsus into a more or less distinct 

 separate series of smaller scutella; basal phalanx of middle toe united 

 to outer toe b}^ its l^asal half {T. hahamensis, T. caudifasciatus) or

 basal half; outer toe, without claw, reaching to or beyond middle of 

 subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly sliorter; 

 hallux shorter than inner toe, decidedly stouter, its claw shorter than 

 the digit; all the claws rather large, moderately to strongly ciu'ved, 

 sharp. 



Coloration. — Above plain gray or grayish brown, the ])il('um and 

 sides of head much darker (sometimes blackish), the wings dusky

 {?)Dioctes Reichenbach, Av. Syst. Nat., 1850, pi. 66, fig. (Type, D. pijrrho- 



leema Reichenbach, = Lamus tyrannus Linnaeus?) [No description.] 



Medium-sized to very large Tyrannidse (wing about 100-140 mm.) 

 with tarsus decidedly shorter than middle toe with claw, tips of outer- 

 most primaries more or less attenuated, tail less than three-fourths 

 to nearly seven-eighths as long as wing and never deeply forked, and 

 adults with a concealed crown-patch of yellow^, orange, or orange-red. 



Bill very variable in relative size, sometimes as long as head, some- 

 times much shorter, its width at anterior end of nostrils sometimes 

 ( T. crassirostris) equal to half the length of exposed culmen, usually 

 much less, but always greater than its depth at same point; lateral 

 outlines of bill usually straight or very nearly so, converging uniforndy 

 to the nonconstricted tip, sometimes slightly convex or inflated 

 anterior to middle portion, the tip of maxilla slightly constricted; 

 exposed culmen shorter than tarsus to very much longer, indistinctly 

 ridged, usually straight or very nearly so to near tip, where rather 

 abruptly and strongly decurved, the tip of maxilla strongly uncinate 

 (in T. crassirostris the culmen obviously convex for whole length); 

 gonys less than twice to more than twice as long as mandibular rami, 

 nearly straight or (in T. crassirostris) obviously convex, sometimes 

 (in T. cubensis, T. dominicensis , and T. melancholicus) with a more or 

 less distinct median ridge; maxillary tomium nearly straight for 

 most of its length, but more or less concave and decurved just before 

 the distinct subterminal notch; mandibular tomium distinctly (but 

 sometimes minutel}^) excised subterminally, the tip of mandible acu- 

 minate. Nostril at least partly exposed, rather small, nearly circular, 

 in lower anterior portion of rather broad nasal fossae. Rictal bristles 

 well developed; feathers of chin and frontal antite with distinct, 

 slender bristly points, the former recurved, the latter arching over 

 nostrils; malar antise, with distinct antrorse or semierect bristles. 

 Wing long and pointed, the longest primaries exceeding distal second- 

 aries by less than one-fourth to a little more than one-third the total 

 length of wing; eighth and ninth, seventh, eighth and ninth, sixth, 

 seventh, eighth and ninth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, or 

 seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth primaries longest and nearly eciual, 

 the tenth (outermost) always (?) longer than fourth, sometimes 

 equal to longest; all these longer primaries attenuated terminally, 

 especially in males. Tail less than three-fourths to nearly seven- 

 eighths as long as wing, slightly rounded, even, or more or less- deeply 

 emarginate (almost forked in T. alhogularis) . Tarsus decidedly 

 ■ shorter than middle toe with claw (but decidedly longer than toe 

 without claw), a little more than one-seventh to less than one-sixth 

 as long as wing, stout, its scutellation typically exaspidean, the 

 acrotarsial scutella distinct and usually occupying the entire outer

side of the tarsus;" basal phalanx of middle toe united to outer toe 

 by about half to decidedly more than half its lon<:;th, to inner toe for 

 less (sometimes much less) than half its len^tli; outer toe, without 

 claw, reaching to or slightly beyond mi(klle of subterminal phalanx 

 of middle toe, the inner toe more or less distinctly (never conspicu- 

 ously) shorter; hallux shorter than inner toe, not conspicuously 

 stouter, its claw shorter than the digit; all the claws moderate in 

 size, curvature, etc. 



Coloration. — (a) Above black (the back and scapulars slaty), wings 

 with narrow white edgings and tail tipped -with white; under parts 

 white (T. tyrannus). (h) Above gray, or grayish brow^n with dusky 

 head, tli(> wings with broad paler edgings; under parts grapsh white 

 (T. dominicensis, T. cuhensis). (c) Above grayish brown or grayish 

 olive; under parts grayish white anteriorly, pale yellow posteriorly. 

 {T. crassirostris). (d) Above gray with blackish tail and grayish 

 brown wings, the back and scapulars olive-greenish or tinged with 

 same; under parts light to bright yellow, throat or chin white, chest 

 usually gray (T. vociferans, T. verticalis, T. melancholicus, T.ayolites, 

 T. albogularis, T. niveigularis) . 



JVid.irfi cation. — Nest open above (cup- or bowl-shaped), placed in 

 trees, varying in composition according to species and locality. Eggs 

 white or more or less deeply buffy, spotted with reddish brown, black, 

 lavender, etc. 



Range. — The whole of temperate and tropical America, including 

 West Indies but excluding Galapagos Archipelago. (Ten species, not 

 counting subspecies.) 



The genus Tyrannus as characterized above is a decidedly hetero- 

 geneous group and, I feel quite sure, includes too many forms and 

 therefore requires restriction; but I have not been able to satisfac- 

 torily subdivide it, partly for the reason that I have not been able to 

 examine two of the species (T. apolites and T. niveigularis), each of 

 which would of course be an important factor in any satisfactory 

 subdivision that might be made. When all the species can be brought 

 together and carefully studied, I believe that three genera can be 

 characterized, as indicated in the following "key:"

The difference in size of the bill between Florida breeding birds and those from other 

 parts of the country is not sufficiently constant nor great enough, in the absence of 

 other characters, to justify subspecific separation of the former. Such, at least, is the 

 writer's opinion.

different geographic areas) except in the case of specimens from northeastern Mexico 

 and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, which are decidedly larger, except bill and feet. 

 The status of specimens from northeastern South America puzzles me exceedingly, 

 and I have not a sufficient series of specimens to enable me to determine their status 

 satisfactorily. On the whole, they seem to resemble Central American specimens 

 more than those from southern Brazil, etc., yet some specimens (notably the single 

 example from the island of Grenada and several from Tobago and Trinidad) I can 

 not distinguish from true T. melancholicus, being quite as dark in coloration as any 

 of the latter. Specimens from Yucatan are almost invariably clear yellowish olive- 

 green on the back, etc., and closely resemble in coloration T. m. couchii; on the other 

 hand, none of the specimens from the island of Cozumel are like those from the 

 mainland of Yucatan, all (in the series before me) having more gray than olive-green 

 above. On the whole, I am not satisfied with the arrangement here presented, but, 

 owing to lack of both time and material, must leave the subject to some one else for 

 more detailed treatment.

Despotes Reichenbach, Av. Syst. Nat., 1850, pi. 6G. (Type, Muscicapa tyrannus 

 Linnaeus.) 



Medium sized Tyrannidje (wing about 104-130 mm.), similar in 

 structure to the smaller-billed species of Tyrannus, but tail exces- 

 sively forked, the lateral rectrices much longer than the wing and 

 more than twice as long as middle pair. 



Bill decidedly shorter than head, moderately broad and depressed 

 basally, its width at frontal antise equalto half the length of exposed 

 culmen(in M. forficata) or much more (M. tyrannus) , sthout one and 

 a half times its depth at same point, the vertical profile wedge- 

 shaped, with straight lateral outlines; exposed culmen nearly as 

 long as tarsus (in 31. for'ficata) or only as long as middle toe with- 

 out claw (AL tyrannus), rather indistinctly ridged (especially in M. 

 forficata), straight for most of its length, rather abruptly decurved 

 terminally, the tip of maxilla distinctly uncinate; gonys much 

 longer than mandibular rami, faintly convex; maxillary tomium 

 nearly straight, distinctly notched subterminally. Nostril partly 

 exposed, rather small, obliquely broadly oval. Rictal bristles 

 strong but rather short; feathers of latero-frontal antia^ with very 

 distinct bristly tips, arching over and extending much beyond 

 nostrils; malar antia? wath distinct antrorse or semierect bristles; 

 feathers of chin with (or without?) minute recurved bristly tips. 

 Wing long and pointed, the longest primaries exceeding distal sec- 

 ondaries by one-third to two-fifths the total length of wing; ninth, 

 or seventh, eighth, and ninth, primaries longest, the tenth (outer- 

 most) longer than seventh (or else the latter as long as eighth and 

 ninth) ; eighth, ninth, and tenth primaries (in M. tyrannus) , or 

 tenth primary alone (in M. forficata), abruptly attenuated ter- 

 minally. Tail longer than wing and deeply forked (excessively 

 so in adult males), the lateral rectrices more than twice (sometimes 

 more than four times) as long as middle pair, the latter shorter 

 than distance from bend of wing to end of distal secondaries (nearly 

 as long in M. tyrannus). Tarsus slightly more than one-seventh 

 as long as wing, stout, its scutellation typically exaspidean, the

acrotarsial scutella distinct, the outer side with (M. tyrannus) or 

 ■vvithout {M. forficata) a separate series of smaller scutella along 

 the upper posterior margin; basal i)halanx of middle toe united to 

 outer toe for a little to decidedly more than half its length, to inner toe 

 for about half its length; outer toe, without claw, reaching to about 

 middle of sul)terminal })halanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly 

 shorter; hallux shorter than inner toe, its claw shorter than the 

 digit; all the claws moderate in size and curvature, sharp. 



Coloration. — (a) Pale gray above, the dorsal region tinged mth 

 red; wangs dusky \\4th pale grayish edgings; tail with black prevail- 

 ing on eight middle rectrices, the two outer pairs pale pink or salmon 

 color extensively tipped with black; under parts very pale gray, pass- 

 ing into white on throat and pale orange-red or salmon color on 

 flanks, under tail-coverts, etc.; a large concealed patch of orange-red 

 on each side of breast and a small concealed spot of same in center 

 of crown {M. forficata). (h) Pileum and sides of head black, the 

 crown with a large concealed patch of bright yellow; back and 

 scapulars light bluish gray; wings dusky with light gray edgings; 

 tail black, the lateral rectrices edged basally with white; under 

 parts entirely white (M. tyrannus). 



NkUficotion. — Nest open above, composed of various materials 

 (according to locality), placed in a small tree. Eggs white or pale 

 cream color, boldly spotted with rich reddish brown, lavender, etc. 



Range. — Southwestern United States (east of Rocky Mountains) 

 to Argentina. (Two species.)

MUSCIVORA TYRANNUS (Linnaeus). 

 SWALLOW-TAILED FLYCATCHER. 



Achdt male. — Pileiim, hindneck, and sides of head (down to upper 

 margin of malar region) uniform deep black, the crown with a very 

 large concealed patch of bright lemon or canary yellow, underlaid 

 posteriorly and laterally by pale yellow or yello\\nsh white; back and 

 scapulars plain clear, rather light gra}^ (about no. 8 to no. 7),° the 

 lower rump similar but darker; upper tail-coverts dull black or dusky, 

 usually margined narrowly with grajdsh; tail black, the lateral rectrix 



a The color is paler and clearer in freshly molted plumage, darker and duller when 

 the plumage becomes old and worn. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 



719 



broadly edged for basal half (more or less) with white; wings dusky 

 grayish brown, the lesser and middle coverts broadly margined with 

 light gray, the greater coverts, remiges, and primary coverts narrowly 

 edged with the same (the edgings sometimes white or nearly so on 

 inner secondaries) ; malar region and entire under parts, including 

 axillars and under wing-coverts, pure white; inner webs of remiges 

 broadly edged with dull yellowish white; bill black, more brownish 

 basally, especially on mandible; iris brown; legs and feet brownish 

 black; length (skins), 325-410 (366); wing, 104-120 (111.1); tail, 

 230-303 (264.9); exposed culmen, 14-17 (15.4); tarsus, 16-18.5 

 (17.2); middle toe, 11.5-14.5 (12.7).« 



Adult female. — Similar to the male and apparently not always 

 distinguishable, but usually with lateral rectices less elongated and 

 yellow crown-patch smaller; length (skins), 267-315 (294); wing, 

 100-107 (103.3); tail, 173-220.5 (201.7); exposed culmen, 15-16.5 

 (15.8); tarsus, 16.5-17.5 (17.1); middle toe, 11-13 (12.4).^ 



Young. — Somewhat like adults but black of head replaced by dark 

 grapsh brown or sooty brown, the crown without concealed yellow; 

 gray of back, etc., duller (more or less decidedly brownish); feathers 

 of rump and upper tail-coverts, as well as lesser and middle wing- 

 coverts, margined with cinnamon or brownish buffy, the greater 

 coverts edged with same. 



a Twelve specimens. 

 ^ Eight specimens. 



I am not able to separate satisfactorily Central American and Mexican specimens 

 from those coming from southern Brazil, Argentina, etc. The foi'mer unquestionably 

 have the gray of the back decidedly paler and clearer than the majority of the latter, 

 but among the more southern specimens are occasional ones which are precisely like 

 northern ones in this respect. Furthermore, specimens from the lower Amazon, 

 Guiana, and Venezuela, exhibit both extremes in regard to color of the back, those 

 examined from Trinidad, T()l>ago, and Grenada being of the darker style. On the 

 whoh' lam inclined to consider the variations as due to age or ccmditionof the plumage 

 rather than to climatic or environal influence, tliough it is not imjjossible that a satis- 

 factory series might show that two forms can be naade out.

Family PIPKIU.E. 



THE MANAKINS. 



Haploophone,'^ catacroinyotloiis/' heteromerous " Mesomyodian 

 Passeres witli tarsal envelope exaspidean " (as in Tyrannidse), and 

 second phalanx of inidtlle toe at least halfway (usually wholly) 

 coherent with outer toe, or else (Pvprites) the first phalanx of middle 

 toe wholly coherent with inner toe. 



The Pipridae, as defined above, comprise not only those genera 

 usually assigned to the group, except Laniisoma, which has been 

 transferred to Cotingidge, but also the genus Laniocera, which Doctor 

 Sclater and others have placed with the Cotingid?e, but which has 

 the typical exaspidean tarsi and more coherent toes diagnostic of 

 the present group. 



In their exaspitlean tarsal envelope the Pipridse agree with the 

 Tyrannidsp, but otherwise resemble much more closely the Cotingidse. 

 The three groups are, however, very closely related, and it is a ques- 

 tion whether they should not be combined to form one family, certain 

 aberrant genera in each group being more or less intermediate, at 

 least in external structure. 



As a rule the Pipridse are much smaller birds than the Cotingidfe, 

 the largest forms being scarcely as large as those of medium size 

 belonging to the latter group. Their tarsi are, as a rule, relatively 

 longer, the tail shorter (in most forms very short, though sometimes 

 the middle pair of rectrices are conspicuously elongated), the bill 

 relatively smaller and, usually, shorter and broader basally. The 

 character of the tarsal envelope, which is typically exaspidean, and 

 the extent of cohesion between the anterior toes is ver}^ uniform in 

 tlie group, the only notable departure being in the genus PiprUes, 

 which has the second phalanx of the middle toe wholly free from the 

 outer (as in the Cotingida?) and the first phalanx wholly united with 

 the inner toe. 



a For definitions of these terms see footnote on p. 328. 




724 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Like those of the Cotmgichx^ the acUiU males of the Piprida? are, 

 with few exceptions, adorned with beautiful colors, usually with deep 

 black predominating, but effectively contrasted with areas of bright 

 blue, crimson, orange, yellow, or white. The females are mostly plain 

 olive-greenish (paler or more yellowish below). In a few genera (as 

 Laniocera, Scotothorus, and Tyranneutes) the sexes are alike and dull 

 in color. 



The family is peculiar to the continental portions of tropical 

 America (including the islands of Trinidad and Tobago), and is rep- 

 resented by about seventy species, belonging to nineteen genera, 

 the majority of which are confined to South America, where it is 

 represented by about eighty species, belonging to twenty-two genera, 

 of which only six occur north of the Isthmus of Panama. 



KEY TO THE GENERA OF PIPRII),K.a 



a. Second phalanx of outer toe wholly united to middle toe. 



b. Wing less than two and a half times as long as tarsus; adult males with outermost 

 primaries very narrow, bowed, and rigid, and feathers of throat elongated. 



Manacus- (p. 727) 

 bb. Wing at least three and a half times as long as tarsus; outermost primaries 

 broad, or if narrow neither bowed nor rigid; feathers of throat not elongated 

 (except in Corapipo, part). 

 c. Smaller (v.ing less than 90 mm.); plumage without spots. 



d. liasal phalanx of inner toe wholly, or at least for greater part, adherent to 

 middle toe; tail (not including abnormally developed or elongated middle 

 rectrices) much shorter than wing to end of secondaries, or else (genus 

 Masiiis) an erect frontal crest, and adult male black with red crest, pileum, 

 and back. 

 e. Tail less than two-thirds as long as wing. 

 /. Lateral rectrices much more than two-thirds as long as middle pair, or 

 else the latter much longer than the others. 

 g. Mesorhinium normal (short and narrow); adult male not entirely 

 black. 

 h. Secondaries longer, reaching much more than two-thirds the distance 

 from bend of wing to tip of longest primaries; exposed culmen 

 shorter than middle toe without claw. 

 i. Rictal bristles shorter (much shorter than bill); wing less than five 

 times as long as tarsus; adult males brightly colored (with black 

 and lilue, red, orange, yellow, or white). 

 j. Shafts of secondaries abnormally thickened. 



k. Shafts of secondaries in adult male excessively thickened, 

 twisted, and expanded terminally into club-shaped or claw- 

 like form; outermost primaries broad throughout; tail less 

 than one-third as long as wing, emarginate; nostril small, 



a I have not been able to examine specimens of the following genera: Metopothitx 

 Sclater; Sapayoa Hartert (Nov. Zool., x, Apr., 1903, 117), and SchiJ/'ornis Bonaparte. 

 The first of these, according to Count von Berlepsch, does not belong to the Pipridse, 

 l)ut is a member of the Dendrocolaptidae (Furnariidse ?), being not distantly related 

 to the genus Xenerpcstes Berlepsch. (See Ibis, Jan., 1903, 108.)

 rounded, very concave beneath, with longest primaries exceeding 

 secondaries by less than length of exposed culmen ; adult males with 

 four or five outermost primaries narrow, much bowed, rather rigid, the 

 fourth to ninth, inclusive, usually longest and nearly equal in length, 

 the tenth usually equal to third (in one species « the sixth to ninth 

 longest, and tenth equal to or longer than fifth). Tail more than 

 half (but less than two-thirds) as long as wing, even or very slightly 

 double-rounded, rounded, or emarginate, the rectrices rather narrow, 

 with rounded tij). Tarsus long (more than two-thirds as long as tail), 

 stout, its scutellation typically exaspidean, but acrotarsium fused or 

 with scutella obsolete, at least on upper half of outer side; heel joint 

 bare, except on sides and front of tibial portion; middle toe, with claw, 

 much shorter than tarsus, its second phalanx adherent to outer toe for 

 at least two-thirds its length, the first united for at least half its length 

 to inner toe; outer toe, without claw, reaching to beyond middle of 

 subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner decidedly shorter; hal- 

 lux (without claw) about as long as inner toe but stouter; claws rather 

 long and sharp, moderately curved. 



Plumage and coloration. — Contour feathers rather long, completely 

 blended; head normally feathered, but feathers of chin and throat 

 elongated (especially in males, in which forming a conspicuous erectile 

 tuft). Adult males with pileum, back, scajnilars, and wings black, 

 rum]) olive-green or gray, broad collar across hindneck, together with 

 auricular region, chin, throat, and chest white, yellow, or orange, 

 underparts of body ])ale gray, light olive-green, olivaceous-orange, or 

 lemon yellow;'' adult females plain olive-green above, paler and more 

 yellowish below. 



Nidification. — Nest shallow cup-shaped, suspended to a forked twig 

 of a bush or small tree, very thin, composed of long grass-stems and 

 l)lant-fibers. Eggs whitish or buffy, longitudinally streaked or 

 ])lotched with reddish brown, etc., the markings sometimes confluent 

 in a ring round larger end. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Peru and southeastern Brazil. (About 

 ten species and subspecies.) 



fl In M. aurantiacus. 



b M. coronatus {Chiromachseris coronata Boucard), which I have not seen, differs 

 materially in its pattern of coloration from the other members of the genus, which are 

 remarkably alike in this respect. It has, in the adult male (the female being unknown) 

 the upper parts black, interrupted by a nuchal collar of bright yellow, which t xtends 

 over sides of head, the throat l)lack, the remaining underparts gray. Possibly it may 

 not belong to this genus.

With a very much larger series of specimens than that examined by Mr. Bangs, I 

 find his proposed separation of the birds of this species untenable. Examples pre- 

 cisely matching the Vera Cruz specimens in the depth of the yellow and other chai^acters 

 are found in the series from Nicaragua and Costa Rica; and specimens from Guatemala 

 show both extremes in the depth of the yellow of the under parts, while an example 

 from Chiapa.-i, southern Mexico, is quite as intensely yellow below a.s any specimen 

 from a more southern locality.

Plumage and coloration. — Contour plumage perfectly blended ; adult 

 males with feathers of frontal region elongated, dense, erect, and some- 

 what stiffened, without bristly points, the crown with a truncated or 

 emarginate crest of long, stiff feathers of glossy ruby red color, the rest 

 of the plumage black, with back and scapulars pale blue; adult females 

 plain olive-green , paler below.

 Eggs cream color or creamy white, speckled with brown. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador. (Six 

 species and subspecies, two species occurring north of the Isthmus cf 

 Panama.)

 it is possibly only a color-variety of that species.

According to the rather small series of adult males examined, those from Costa

 Mexico and Guatemala, and, as a rule, a smaller and relatively narrower bill, but I am 

 imable to detect any difference in coloration.

 convex; maxillary tomium usually straight or nearly so, sometimes 

 faintly concave, at least anteriorly, distinctly but minutely notched 

 subterminally. Nostril mostly or at least largely exposed, longitu- 

 dinally oval, linear or somewhat coma-shaped, overhung by a broad 

 membraneous operculum. Rictal bristles distinct (but variable as to

Plumage and coloration. — Contour ])lumage blended, the feathers 

 of the pileum, however, sometimes narrow and distinctly outlined; 

 head entirely feathered, without crest or frontal tuft; tibial feathers 

 completely hiding heel joint, sometimes very full and soft, and 

 extending over upper portion of tarsus. Adult males mostly uni- 

 form black (either velvety or glossy), (1) with pileum and sides of 

 head scarlet or orange-yellow and thighs yellow or orange, (2) whole 

 head, neck, and breast orange (abdomen yellow in one species), (3) 

 crown blue, (4) pileum white and rump pale grayish blue, (5) fore- 

 head pale blue or bluish white, lower rump bright blue, abdomen 

 yellow or orange, or (6) whole pileum pure white, the coloration other- 

 wise entirely black; or (7) the upper parts green, wdth white pileum 

 and rump, the under parts yellow. Adult females plain olive, olive- 

 green, or dull green above, paler or more yellowish below.

o I am unable to find constant differences between these two forms. 



& The females and young of these three fomns are apparently not distinguishable. 



cin occasional specimens, probably very young birds, there is little difference in 

 color between the pileum and back, l)ut the difference is nevertheless appreciable. 

 In such examples the axillars and under wing-coverts are decidedly yellowish olive 

 instead of gray. 



f^ Having only one female of P. p. anthracina for comparison, I am unable to say 

 whether there are constant color differences l>etween that sex of this form and P.p. pipra. 

 It certainly differs sufficiently from any of the females of true P. p. pipra before me 

 (one from British Guiana and five from Suapure, Venezuela) in having the pileum 

 and hindneck dark slate-gray or slate color strongly contrasted with the bright olive- 

 green of the back, in this respect agreeing with a young male of P. p. pipra; but the 

 back, scapulars, and outer surface of greater wing-coverts and secondaries are very 

 much brighter olive-green and the chest extensively and uniformly yellowish olive- 

 green instead of merely tinged with that color. It is possible the specimen is in reality 

 a young male, and not an adult female; but whether correctly sexed or not, it is easily 

 distinguishable from either the adult female or young male of P. p. pipra. 



«The single female examined of this form is easily distinguished from any t)ne of 

 five females of P. p. pipra, from British Guiana and Venezuela, being grayer beneath 

 and having the pileum and hindneck rather light slate-gray (much paler than in the 

 young male of P. p. pipra) strongly tinged with olive-green. It resembles rather

 YELLOW-THIGHED MANAKIN. 



Adult male. — Head and neck, except chin and throat, intense 

 flame scarlet or orange-vermilion, becoming paler and more orange 

 on forehead, the feathers pale yellow or yellowish white basally; 

 chin (more or less extensively) pale j^ellow or yellowish white; thighs 

 pale (primrose or straw) yellow; axillars and innermost under wing- 

 coverts pale (primrose) yellow; inner webs of remiges grayish brown, 

 the primaries passing into grayish white, the secondaries into pale 

 yellow or yellowish white on edges for basal half (approximately) ; 

 rest of plumage uniform black; maxilla horn brown, paler on tomia; 

 mandible pale brownish (flesh colored in life) ; iris white ; " legs and 

 feet Isabella color; « length (skins), 89-110 (100); wing, 53.5-61.5

 14-16 (15); middle toe, 9.5-11 (10.1).^ 



Adult female. — Above plain greenish olive or dull olive-green; 

 beneath decidedly paler olive, still paler and sometimes sufi"used 

 \\'ith pale yellowish, on chin and throat and also on abdomen, thighs, 

 and under tail-coverts, which sometimes incline to olivaceous prim- 

 rose yellow or greenish straw yellow; axillars and innermost under 

 wing-coverts pale (straw or primrose) yellow; bill and feet as in adult 

 male; length (skins), 97-116 (104) ; wing, 59.5-63 (61.3) ; tail, 29.5-33.5 

 (31.6) ; exposed culmen, 9.5-11.5 (10.1) ; tarsus, 14-15.5 (14.9) ; middle 

 toe, 9-10.5 (9.9).^ 



closely two specimens from Chamicuros, eastern Peru, botli determined as females, 

 one of which has the pileum and hindneck much more strongly tinged with olive- 

 green, while the other has them less so, the gray being at the same time slightly darker. 

 These two Peruvian l)irds further agree with the Bahia specimen in their very short 

 tail (only 26 mm. in l:)oth specimens, the wing being 59.5 and 60), and it is therefore 

 possible the bird from eastern Peru may be referable to P. p. hahise, thougli its status 

 can not be determined without examination ofadult males.

& Since Hellmayr, who refers the Panama birds of this species to P. p. pipra, 

 describes the adult female of that form as having the pileum and hindneck as olive- 

 greenish though in most specimens "distinctly mixed with grayish," it is possible the 

 specimen described above is wrongly sexed and is really a young male. Hellmayr, 

 however, apparently had no female from any Panama locality, and it may be, therefore, 

 that the female of the Panama form in reality has the pileum and hindneck slaty, as 

 in females of P. p. coracina and P. p. comata. 



Immature males of the Bahia form (and probably also other forms) have the whole 

 pileum white, as in adult males, but the rest of the plumage, instead of being black, 

 is deep olive-green above (becoming slaty on upper back and hindneck) and plain 

 slate-gray beneath, slightly tinged on chest and sides with olive-green. A similar 

 stage of plumage probably occurs in the Panama form.

« Eleven specimens. 

 b Ten specimens. 



c Three adult females from Manatee Lagoon, British Honduras, and one from Yaruca, 

 Honduras, are decidedly referable to this southern form, if a subdivision of the species 

 is to be made. I have had the advantage of a much larger series of the southern form 

 than that examined by Mr. Bangs, and find that by restricting true S. verse-pads to 

 birds from southern Mexico, Guatemala, and western and central Honduras specimens 

 from all other localities stand out clearly by the characters given in the above diag- 

 nosis, and none of them more strongly than the liirds from Manatee Lagoon! I am 

 unable to account for this distribution unless on the hypothesis that S. v. durnicola 

 follows the coast or coast-slope of Honduras only and thus reaches the coast of British 

 Honduras. Birds from Chamelicon and San Pedro, which are near the coast in north- 

 western Honduras, are partly undistinguishable from Guatemalan examples, and 

 therefore are true S. versc-pacis and partly intermediate, though rather nearer to the 

 northern form. Unless a subdivision of the species is made as indicated, I do not see 

 how S. r. durnicola can l)e maintained as a vaild form, since otherwise there are neither 

 color-characters nor differences of proportions on which fo base it. 



<^ I have not seen specimens from these localities and therefore can not be sure that I 

 have allocated the records correctly.

Similar to S. a. amazonus," but with crown less distinctly riifescent 

 and chest much more distinctly fulvescent; similar in coloration of 

 upper parts to -S'. turdinum,'^ but color of under parts slightly paler, 

 with chest more distinctly fulvescent, and size much smaller; other-

 of chest and tlu-oat. 



Adults {sexes alike). — Above plain light bister brown, the pileum 

 more rufescent (cinnamon-brown or vandyke), the rump and upper 

 tail-coverts slightly paler and more olivaceous; wings and tail warm- 

 sepia brown, the wing-coverts and remiges with outer webs more 

 rufescent (russet-brown or vandyke), especially toward edge; throat 

 and chest plain cinnamon-brown, deep wood-brown, or grayish cin- 

 namon, becoming paler on chin; rest of under parts plain pale olive 

 or light grayish olive, usually more or less tinged with yellowish, 

 paler and more yellowish on abdomen, where usually narrowly and 

 very faintly barred with darker, the thighs more brow^nish; axillars

 paler on upper portion of tarsus. 



Young. — Above plain russet-brown or vandyke, the pileum and 

 hindneck much paler (between cinnamon and russet) ; under parts 

 plain cinnamon-brown, paler on throat and sides of head, paler and 

 more grayish posteriorly, the under tail-coverts mostly grayish white;

LANIOCERA RUFESCENS (Sclater). 

 EUFOUS MANAKIN. 



Adult male. — Above plain dull einnamon-rufoiis or hazel, darker 

 (nearly burnt umber) on crown, the feathers of occiput tipped with 

 duller brown, the back and scai)ulars (especially k)wer portion of 

 former) indistinctly intermixed with somewhat grayish brown, the 

 rump and u])per tail-coverts narrowly and very indistinctly barred 

 with brown; lesser wing-coverts uniform bright cinnamon-rufous; 

 middle coverts and posterior row of lesser coverts brown (deep broc- 

 coli brown or between mummy and light bister), each with a very 

 large terminal broadly triangular spot of dull orange-rufous or dull 

 light cinnamon-rufous; greater coverts broccoli brown narrowly 

 edsed with dull orange-rufous or dull lioht cinnamon-rufous and 

 tipped with a large triangular spot of the same; primary' coverts dull 

 cinnamon-rufous or russet, passing into deep grayish brown on ter- 

 minal portion; remiges between orange-rufous and russet, their inner 

 webs deep grayish (broccoli) brown for terminal half (more or less), 

 their shafts dusky brown ; tail russet, the inner webs of rectrices pass- 

 ing into didl orange-rufous on edges; chin and upper throat uniform 

 tawny-ochraceous passing into grayish tawny or cinnamon on lower 

 throat ; rest of under parts plain tawny-ochraceous, the chest (only) 

 narrowly and very indistinctly barred with grayish brown; axillars 

 and under wing-coverts light tawny-ochraceous, the inner webs of 

 renaiges (except terminally) similar but deeper and slightly more rufes- 

 cent; on each side of breast, near axillars, a patch of lemon yellow, 

 composed of rather elongated,. loose-webbed feathers; bill deep horn 

 brown, the basal half of mandible paler; legs and feet light horn 

 brownish (in dried skins); length (skins), 192-208 (198); wing, 

 103.5-114 (109.3); tail, 81-90.5 (84); exposed culmen, 17-19 (18); 

 tarsus, 20-22.5 (21.4); middle toe, 13-15 (14.2).« 



Adult female.^ — Similar in coloration to the adult male, but usu- 

 ally (?) with the yellow subaxillary patch replaced by one of orange- 



C' Five specimens, only one of them fully adult as to plumage. 



''Judging from the specimens examined, leading authorities seem to be in error in 

 supposing the sexes to differ materially in coloration and also in considering the speci- 

 mens with a few black spots on under parts and black tips to the wing-coverts as the 

 adult male. On the contrary, the latter are almost certainly immature birds. The 

 black spots on the under parts are, in all the specimens I have seen, very few in 

 number and scarcely alike in any two specimens as to position, which leads me to 

 suspect that the feathers bearing these black spots are merely remnants of the first 

 plumage. 



A circumstance which I am not able to understand in connection with the color- 

 ation of this species (unless explainable as a slip of the pen) is that both Salvin and 

 Godman {Biologia Centrali- Americana, Aves, ii, 130) and Hartert {Novitates Zoologicse, 

 ix, 610) mention yellow " ^ani-tufts." I have never seen a specimen of the species 

 possessing any yellow on the flanks, and therefore suspect that the yellow subaxillary 

 patch is meant.

a Of the two adult females examined one has this patch yellow, as in the male, the 

 other orange-ochraceous. 1 am therefore unable to determine which is the more 

 usual color. 



b Five specimens, three of them in immature plumage. 



The series examined is much too small to enable me to determine whether there 

 are any constant geographic differences in coloration or measurements. 



c Of two young males, one (from Segovia River, southern Honduras) has the sub- 

 axillary patch large and bright lemon yellow, the other (from Loma del Leon, Panama) 

 has it orange-ochraceous with a very slight tinge or admixture of yellow near outer 

 edge; the three young females examined, on the other hand, all have this space 

 orange-ochraceous, though one of them (from Panama) shows a slight admixture of 

 yellow. 



d These feathers 1 take to be remnants of the first plumage.

Temminck.) 

 Hemipipo Cabanis, Weignuin's Archiv., xiii, pt. i, 1847, 234. (Type, Pipra 



chJoris Cabanis.) 



Medium-sized Pipridse (wing about 62-75 mm.) having the second 

 phalanx of middle toe wholly free from outer toe. 



Bill small,'' less than half as long as head, its depth at nostrils 

 greater than its witlth at same point, and equal to much more than 

 half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla ; culmen nearly straight 

 basally, then gradually and decidedly curved, the tip of maxilla dis- 

 tinctly uncinate; gonys longer than mandibular rami, slightly but 

 decidedh" convex; maxillary tomium straight or slightly concave, dis- 

 tinctly notched aubterminally. Nostril mostly covered by antrorse 

 and decumbent bristly nasal plumules, rather large, roundish or 

 broadly oval, with narrow superior membrane. Rictal bristles well 

 developed, and bristly tips of antrorse latero-frontal and mental 

 plumules equally large. Wing moderate, with longest primaries 

 exceeding secondaries by about length of tarsus to nearly as long as 

 the latter; eighth and seventh primaries longest, the ninth and sixth 



a I consider this to be probably the same as L. rufescens for the reason that every one 

 of the color characters ascribed to it applies perfectly to the adult of the latter, which, 

 apparently, was unknown to the describcr of .4. tcrlia. 



b In form and relative size the bill of this genus is remarkably similar to that of cer- 

 tain species of the genus Vireo ( V. huttoni, V. carmioli, etc.), and the coloration is also 

 decidedly "vireonine." 




768 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



successively shorter, the tenth longer than fifth. Tail slightly shorter 

 than wing to end of secondaries, much rounded (its graduation equal 

 to or more tiian length of exposed cuhnen), the rectrices moderate in 

 width, with rounded tip. Tarsus longer than commissure, slender, its 

 scutellation typicalh" exaspidean, but with acrotarsal scutella some- 

 times fused, or nearly so, on outer side ; middle toe, with claw, shorter 

 than tarsus, its second phalanx wholly free from outer toe, its first 

 phalanx wholly united to inner toe; outer toe, without claw, reaching 

 to beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe 

 nearly as long; hallux, without claw, slightly shorter than inner, slen- 

 der, its basal pad (tylarus) neither expanded nor flattened. 



Plumage ami coloration. — Contour plumage soft and blended ; head 

 normally feathered ; coloration above olive-greenish, with or without 

 gray on head or neck; wings dusky with olive-green or yellowish edg- 

 ings, the tertials usually, and greater wing-coverts sometimes, with 

 large terminal spots of pale yellow or ^^ellowish white; beneath light 

 olive-greenish or yellowish or pale gray, becoming yellowish on upper 

 throat and under tail-coverts; sexes essentiallly alike in color.« 



Nidijication. — (Unknown ?) 



Range. — Costa Rica to Ecuador and southeastern Brazil. (Five 

 species.) 



PIPRITES GRISEICEPS Salvin. 

 GRAY-HEADED MANAKIN. 



Adult male. — Pileum, hindneck, and sides of head (including 

 loral, orbital, auricular, and malar regions) plain slate-gray, relieved 

 by a conspicuous and continuous orbital ring of white; back, scapu- 

 lars, rump, upper tail-coverts and lesser wing-coverts uniform bright 

 olive-green; tail didl black, tipped with pale buffy grayish brown, 

 the outer webs of rectrices edged with olive-green, or pale buffy olive, 

 this increasing in extent toward outermost rectrix, on which it occu- 

 pies, approximately, the terminal third, the basal portion ])eing 

 dusky grayish brown instead of blackish; wings (except lesser coverts) 

 dull black or dusky, the middle coverts broadly tipped or terminally 

 margined with olive-green, the outer webs of greater coverts mostly 

 olive-green (edged terminally with yellowish), the remiges edged 

 with olive-green, most broadly on secondaries, the innermost of which 

 has the outer web wholly olive-green, the inner web wholly pale yel- 



a The above characters are taken from the four species constituting the genus Hemi- 

 pipo of Cabanis. The type of Piprites {Pipra pileata Temminck) is very different in 

 coloration, the male being chestnut above with black pileum, wings dusky with green- 

 ish edgings, under parts fulvous, becoming yellowish on abdomen; the female is simi- 

 lar, except that the liack is olivaceous instead of chestnut. According to Sclater (Cat. 

 Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, 28.3) Piprites pileatus (which I have not seen) would appear to 

 present certain structural differences, and I would not be surprised to find that it is 

 generically separable from the group named Hemipipo liy ('at)anis.

of middle toe coherent with outer toe (or else, in genus PJmnicircus "■ 

 only, with inner side of tarsus feathered). 



The rano;e of variation in external features is so great in the group 

 known as Cotingidne that it is very difficult to discover external 

 characters additional to-those given above, which are common to all. 

 Doctor Sclater ^ separates the family from the Tyrannida; and Pipridse 

 by the alleged pycnaspidean tarsi ; but, while the tarsal envelope is 

 never exaspidean, as in the two groups mentioned, it is by no means 

 always pycnaspidean, this type of structure being typically developed 

 in less than half the genera, the majority having the tarsal envelope 

 taxaspidean or modified holaspidean.'^ 



Owino; to lack of sufficient knowledge of the internal structure of 

 the various genera, the limits of the family, as well as its relationship 

 to allied groups, are at present uncertain, and those here assigned 

 are merely tentative. If, however, the Pipridse are to be recognized 

 as a separate family, it becomes necessary to annex to the latter 

 the germs Laniocera (usually considered a member of the Cotingidse), 

 on account of its typically exaspidean tarsi and Piprine foot-structure, 

 to transfer from the Piprid^e to the Cotingidse the genus Lanii- 

 soma, and to eliminate, as a separate group, the genus Rupicola. 

 Whether Phcenicircus should be left with the Cotingidse, associated 

 with Rupicola, or placed by itself, I am not able to determine. At 

 the same time, after having defined the groups Cotingidse and Tyran- 

 nida^ by the difference in their tarsal envelope (apparently the only 

 available external character, while our knowledge of their internal 

 structure is much too fragmentary to be of service in the matter), 

 it becomes necessary to transfer from the latter to the former certain 

 forms which certainly belong there unless other genera to which they 

 are evidently related are wrongly placed in that group. These are 

 the genera Sirystes, allied to Lipaugus and Casiornis; and three 

 species removed from the Tyrannine genera, Myiarchus, Elsenia, and 



« Phoenicircus is so different from the true Cotingidse in its foot-structure that its 

 proper allocation is doubtful. It may possibly be more nearly related to Rupicola, 

 as suggested by Sclater and others.- 



b Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., xiv, 1888, 2. 



c The typical, or nearly typical, pycnaspidean tarsus is possessed only by Cephal- 

 opterua, Pyroderus, Querida, Hseviatodcrus, Calviceps, Gijvincdenis, Procnias, Tityra, 

 Lathria, Carpodedes, Xipholena, Cotinga, Calyptura, and Idiotriccus, the last named 

 (hitherto referred to the Tyrannidse) having not only the planta tarsi but also the 

 lower portion of the acrotarsium covered with small, roughened, almost tuberculous, 

 scutella. In Erator, Platypsaris, Pachyrhamphus, Xenopsaris, Ampelion, Phihalura, and 

 Heliochera there is a continuous definite row of rather large scutella along each side of 

 the planta tarsi, the structure being therefore essentially if not typically taxaspidean. 

 In Lipaugus, Casiornis, Sirystes, Tolmarchus, and Attila there is a single row, either 

 along the median line or occupying the outer and part of the inner side, while in 

 Euchlornis, Stictornis, and lodopleura the whole planta tarsi is without any sort of 

 scutellation. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 771 



Pogonotriccus, respectively, tlie first {'' Myiarchus" validus) and 

 second havinsi; the tarsal envelope almost typically holaspidean. 

 Even with the slitjjhtly modified limits mentioned above, the Cotin- 

 gidte constitutes ''one of the most heterogeneous of all the groups 

 of birds. One has only to compare the little briirhtly colored Calyp- 

 tura cristata with tlie larp;e soml^er ITmbrella-l)irds {Ceyhalopterus) 

 to see how o])vi()usly this is the case. Unfortunately, the anatom^' 

 of a XnYf^e number of the species has not 3-et been studied, so that 

 the classification rests mainly upon external characters. The bond 

 of union at present is the structure of the tarsal coverin<r, which, 

 to use Suntlevall's term, is 'pycnaspidean.' " This structure includes 

 the Phytotomida^, which again are separable by their serrate bills." ^ 



As stated by the authors of the "Biologia," quoted above, the 

 Cotingida" comprises birds of extremely diverse form, size, and color- 

 ation. The smallest species, scarcely 3^ inches long, closely resem- 

 l)les in general form and coloration some of the smaller Manaldns, 

 while the largest, 18 inches long, are not unlike a crow in appear- 

 ance. Some species are perhaps the most richly colored of birds, 

 others again are as plain in plumage as it is possible for birds to 

 be, while a few are even uncouth in aspect, having bald heads, or 

 worm-like fleshy appendages to the head. Many genera have remark- 

 able modifications of the primary quills. 



^lost species are said to feed chiefly on fruits, though insects 

 doubtless constitute a considerable part of their fare. 



The Cotingas are peculiar to tropical America, chiefly the conti- 

 nental portion (only two species occurring in the West Indies, and 

 these confined to Jamaica). About thirty genera and considerably 

 more than one hundred species are known, of which only twelve 

 genera and about twenty-five species (including subspecies) occur 

 northward of the Isthmus of Panama. Of the two West Indian 

 species one belongs to a continental genus (Flatypsaris) , the other 

 to a monotypic endemic genus (Hylonax). "In this case," says 

 Doctor Sclater, "as in many other Neotropical groups of animals 

 and plants, there seem to be three districts which may be called the 

 principal 'loci' of their development, namely: Central America 

 (characterized by Carpodectes and the extraordinary species of GJias- 

 morhynclius and Ce phalopterus) , Guiana and Amazonia (the home of 

 Phmnicocercus, Rupicola, Querula,'' (TymnocepJialus , and Gymnoderus), 

 and southeastern Brazil, where alone we find Tijuca, Pkihalura, and 

 Calyptura.'' 



« But see footnote on p. 770. 



b Salvin and Godman, Bioloyia Cent rali- Americana, Ares, ii, 117, footnote. 



c Instead of Querula, Hxmatoderus was no doubt intended, for, while the latter, a 

 large and magnificently colored bird, is peculiar to Guiana and Amazonia, the former 

 is not, but extends northward to Costa Rica.

^;"^(;:i;T,;^^hat"xmopsaris has not an exaspidean tarsus, and therefore can not be a

 resemblin- Xenopsaris that an error of identification has been made, or else that their 

 understanding of the limits and characters of the two groups is different from my own. 



a Occasional fully adult males occur in which the ninth primary is entirely normal, 

 both as to size and form; therefore the limits of this group might well include A enop- 

 sam, so far as this character is concerned.

a Twelve specimens. 



Some of the Honduras specimens are doubtless young birds, which may account for 

 the shorter wing measurements. 



The adult males from Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico all have the purple pectoral 

 area relatively decidedly larger than those from Costa Rica;" but this may possibly be 

 due to different make-up of skins. If not, then certainly the birds from the two areas 

 should be separated subspecifically. Of the two adult females from Costa Rica one is in 

 greatly worn plumage and therefore is not comparable with any of the northern series; 

 the other is more strongly tinged with buff on lower parts and has the whitish tips to 

 feathers of upper parts smaller than any of the si)ecimenH from Honduras and north- 

 ward. The series, both males and females, from Costa Rica is, however, much too 

 small for satisfactory comparison.

« Two specimens — one from Bogota, Colombia, the other from line of the Panama 

 Railway. 



There are certain differences of coloration between these two specimens which may, 

 possibly, indicate that they represent two forms; but the one from Bogota is in par- 

 tially immature plumage, and besides a considerable greater number of specimens 

 would be necessary to decide the point.

I am unable to distinguish Panama specimens from the type of T. rcgxtloides (from 

 Diamantina, Lower Amazon) as to coloration, Colombian specimens being, so far as 

 I am able to see, precisely similar. It is true the Panama 1)irds are larger than the 

 type of T. reguloides: but if size alone is to be made a criterion the Colombian speci- 

 mens must be separated, for they are still larger. On the whole, therefore, it seems 

 best, at least until a very much better series of specimens can be studied, to consider 

 all, except the decidedly darker and easily distinguished Cayenne bird, as represent- 

 ing a single form, which varies locally in dimensions. I would not be surprised if a 

 satisfactory series from Cayenne should show that there is in reality no occasion for 

 subdividing the species at all, though the sinsfle Cayenne specimen examined by me 

 is certainly very different in coloration from any other specimen I have seen.

 anterior half. Rictal bristles small and slender, but distinct. Wing 

 moderate, rounded, the longest primaries exceeding distal second- 

 aries by about length of exposed culmen; seventh and eighth, or 

 seventh, eighth, and ninth, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) 

 about equal to fourth. Tail nearly as long as wing (longer than dis- 

 tance from bend of wing to end of secondaries) , emarginate or double- 

 rounded, the rectrices widening slightly terminally, wdth tip broadly 

 rounded. Tarsus nearly twice as long as middle toe without claw 

 (less than one-third as long as wing), its scutellation quasi-pycnas-

 side of tarsus, the planta tarsi covered with nonscu^ellate integu- 

 ment except along the posterior median ridge where showing slight 

 granulations or small and indistinct papillae; outer toe (without claw) 

 decidedl}" shorter than middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter 

 than outer; basal phalanx of middle toe almost wholly uniLcd to outer 

 toe, about half adherent to inner toe; hallux (without claw) about as

 shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Olive above, becoming darker on pileum, which has a 

 median patch (more or less concealed) of white or pale yellow; wing 

 dusky with middle and greater wing-coverts broadly tipped or ter- 

 minally edged with light olive-yellowish, the secondaries edged with 

 same; under parts light j^ellow, passing into light olive on chest and

 forehead) indistinctly streaked with dusky; hinchieck, sides of neck, 

 and upper back greenish olive, passing gradually into olive-brown or 

 bister on scapulars and lower back; rump and vipper tail-coverts

 as specifically distinct.

Adult male. — Pileum and hindneck greenish olive or dull grayish 

 olive-green, more or less distinctly streaked with dusky, the olive 

 sometimes (in younger individuals ?) replaced by olive-brown or even 

 reddish sepia brown; back and scapulars plain reddish Vandyke 

 brown to olive-brown (nearly raw-umber), usually brighter or more 

 reddish posteriorly and more olivaceous anteriorly; rump and upper 

 tail-coverts plain light chrome-yellow to light ochraceous-yellow, 

 usually more ochraceous on upper part of rump; tail grayish browTi 

 or brownish olive terminally, becoming gradually more buffy brow^n 

 or cinnamomeous basally (more or less extensively) ; wings dusky gray- 

 ish brown, the middle and greater coverts tipped or terminally mar- 

 gined with light buffy brown, cinnamon-brown, or russet, the inner 

 secondaries plain brown (light olive to light bister, or, more rarel}-, 

 nifescent sepia), the outer secondaries edged wnth the same; sides 

 of head and neck similar m color to pileum and hindneck, the lores 

 paler, the superciliary region usually narrowly streaked with pale 

 olive-yellowish and dusky; throat and chest light yellow (pale canary 

 to sulphur or citron), or at least partly of this color, the throat more 

 narrowly and distinctly streaked with dusky grayish or olive, the 

 chest more broadly and less distinctly streaked with paler grayish 

 or olive ;'^ breast and abdomen white, sometimes faintly tinged with 



o Tip of bill broken off. 



b One specimen (the type). 



c There is much variation (apparently of a purely individual character) in the 

 extent of the yellow on the anterior under parts and the character of the streaking; 

 sometimes the gray or olive streaks on the chest are so broad that the color of the chest 

 may properly be described as gray or light olive (or yellowi-'^h olive) narrowly streaked 

 with pale yellow, the latter being sometimes nearly oksolete and the color of the cliest, 

 therefore, nearly uniform. There is also much variation ii\ the depth of color of the 

 streaks on the throat, which are usually a medium gray or olive with a narrow sliaft- 

 line of black. In one specimen (a male from Sucuyd, Nicaragua) the whole throat 

 and median portion of the chest are dull white (the latter faintly tinged with yellow) 

 and the very narrow streaks brownish gray or grayish l>rown.

T am puzzled to know whether specimens from the coast district of British Honduras 

 (Manatee Lagoon) should be referred to the southern or northern forms of this species, 

 since they are intermediate, both in coloration and measurements. On the whole 

 they seem to be nearer to A. c. salvini in coloration. 



Specimens from the line of the Panama Railway (the type-district of A. sdateri

 olive, scarcely different -from the color of the pileum and hindneck. No similarly

SALVIN 'S ATTILA. 



Similar to A. c. citreopygus, but more tawny brown above (back and 

 scapulars raw-umber to russet), the pileum and hindneck never oliva- 

 ceous and, usually, more heavily streaked W'ith black; rump and upper 



colored specimens occur in the series examined from western Panama and northward, 

 and it is possible that a large series from eastern Panama may show that A. sclaten 

 (or more correctly A. citreopygus sclateri) may be a tenable race. If such should prove 

 to be the case its range would be restricted to eastern Panama (and possibly adjacent 

 portions of Colombia, from wh(>re, however, I have not seen specimens).

 LAWRENCE S ATTILA. 



Similar to A. c. salvini, but much lighter and more cinnamomeous 

 brown (hindneck, back, and scapulars tawny brown or ochraceous- 

 ])rown, even the pileum sometimes cinnamomeous), the rump and 

 upper tail-coverts ocliraceous (very rarely ocher-yellow), much less 

 strongly contrasted with color of back, etc.; tail wholly cinnamon or 

 dull tawny; under parts essentially as in ^4. c. salvini."- 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 194-209 (202); wing, 90.5-98.5 (95); 

 tail, 77-86.5 (80.6) ; exposed culmen, 23-25.5 (24.1) ; tarsus, 25-27 (26) ;

« As in both A. c. dtreopygus and A. c. salvini, the under parts are sometimes exten- 

 sively yellow; in fact, one of the original specimens collected by Grayson at Mazatlan 

 has no white whatever on the under surface, which is continuously clear canary 

 yellow, with, however, the usual dusky streaks on throat and chest and tawny-buff 

 sides. It is on this style of plumage, which is undoubtedly merely an individual 

 " xanthochroic " phase, that A. hypoxanthus Salvin and Godman was based. Were it 

 not that the specimen from Vera Paz described by Messrs. Salvin and Godman and 

 that from Venta del Pelegi-ino, Guerrero, are said by them to be ''practically insep- 

 arable," the name hypoxanthus (although based on a comparatively rare color-phase) 

 would be available for the form which I have named salvini; but in view of the state- 

 ment just quoted, and also the very strong probability that A. c. cinnan^omeus extends 

 along the Pacific coast even beyond Guatemala, I conclude that the Vera Paz speci- 

 men, although from outside the normal range of the form, and from a district which 

 should be inhabited by A. c. salvini, really belongs to the Pacific coast form.

Somewhat like A. c. salvini, but decidedly smaller, with relatively 

 larger bill; brown of upper parts paler and duller (less rufescent) ; 

 ochraceous of rump and upper tail-coverts paler, and chest more or 

 less strongly suffused with gray (sometimes nearly uniform gray),

 vailing medially; rest of pileum brownish mouse gray, heavily 

 streaked with black; hindneck, sides of neck, and upper back plain 

 light buffy brown (between wood brown and raw-umber), deepening

ATTILA CITREOPYGUS COZUMEl^/E (Ridgway). 

 COZUMEL ATTILA. 



Similar to A. c. gaumeri, but rump and upper tail-coverts usually 

 much darker (tawny-ochraceous instead of ocher yellow), pileum 

 usually browner and more narrowly streaked,*^ streaks on throat 

 more grayish, and color of sides, flanks, axillars, and under wdng- 

 coverts buffy cinnamon, cinnamon-buff, or buff'^ instead of yellow- 

 ish buff or buff -yellow; averaging smaller. 



ttTwo specimens, from Puerto Morelos and Chichen-Itza. 



?>An adult male and a young female from near Manatee Lagoon, British Honduras, 

 must, I think, be referred to this form, although undoubtedly not typical, but indi- 

 cating unmistakable intergradation with A. c. citreopygus or A. c. salvim. In coloration 

 the adult male is, allowing for difference in condition of the plumage (which is 

 decidedly though not badly worn in the British Honduras specimen), practically 

 identical with adults from Yucatan, but the wing, tail, and tarsus are slightly longer 

 and the slightly larger. Two other adults from the same locality, taken in August 

 and October, respectively, and therefore possibly migrants, are, however, distinctly 

 referable to A. c. salvini, though intermediate between that form and A. c. citreopygus. 

 (See remarks on p. 806.) 



Measurements of the British Honduras specimen compared with those of an adult 

 male from Yucatan (Puerto Morelos) are as follows: 



cin a single specimen (the type) the pileum is decidedly more grayish than the 

 back, precisely as in A. c. gaumeri, the black streaks broader, and, on the forehead, 

 intermixed with white streaks. This specimen, in fact, although unfortunately the 

 type of A. cozumelx, is distinctly intermediate between that form and A. r. gaumeri, 

 having, besides, the axillars and under wing-coverts light ocher yellow or naples 

 yellow, instead of buff, cinnamon-buff, or buffy cinnamon, as in all other specimens 

 examined from Cozumel Island.

distinct tlioiigh slender antrorse bristly points. Wing moderate, 

 rounded, the ninth, eighth, and seventh primaries longest, the tenth 

 not longer (sometimes shorter) than fifth; wing-tip about equal to 

 tarsus. Tail nearly as long as wing (longer than distance from bend 

 to end of secondaries), even or slightly emarginate, the rectrices 

 rounded at tip, the lateral ones gradually widening terminally. Tar- 

 sus slender, shorter than commissure, its scutellation holaspidean, the 

 single row of large quadrate scutella forming the planta tarsi, having 

 its anterior margin on outer side joining the posterior margin of the 

 acrotarsium a little behind the median line; middle toe, without claw, 

 about two-thirds as long as tarsus; inner toe, without claw, reaching 

 about to middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the outer 

 decidedly longer, its claw reaching to middle of that of middle toe; 

 hallux shorter than inner toe, its claw nearly as long as the digit; all 

 the claws strongly curved, acute; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly 

 adherent to outer toe, about half so to inner toe: basal tylari of hal- 

 lux and inner toe broad and flattened. 



Coloration. — Pileum, wings, and tail blackish, the wings with con- 

 spicuous whitish, grayish, or buffy edgings, the tail sometunes tipped 

 with white; back and scapulars grayish (with or without darker 

 streaks), passing into paler grayish or whitish on rump; under parts 

 plain pale grayish, becoming whitish on abdomen. Sexes alike in 

 color. 



Nidification. — (Unknown ?)

This genus, hitherto placed in the family Tyrannidse, certainly 

 comes very near to Lipaugus and Casiornis, both of which are by 

 general consent considered as members of the Cotingidse. The 

 structure of the feet, including the scutellation of the tarsal envelope 

 and the amount of cohesion between the anterior toes, is precisely the 

 same as in the two genera mentioned, except that Lipaugus differs (as 

 it also does not only from all Tyrannidse but from all other Cotingidie 

 as well) in having the scutella of the upper portion of tlie planta tarsi 

 developed into prominent tubercles or serrations. Tlie coloration of 

 Sirystes suggests that of Erator and PacJiyrJiamphus quite as much as 

 it does that of any member of the Tyrannidse; but the bill is typically 

 tyrannine, resembling closely that of Tyrannus and the stouter billed 

 Myiarclii, which probably accounts for the erroneous allocation of the 

 genus to the last-named family.

Small Cotingidse (wino; about 65-80 mm.), closely allied to Platyp- 

 saris, but with tail more strongly rounded (almost graduated in 

 some species), bill relatively shorter, broader, and more depressed, 

 and adult males with abbreviated ninth primary more sharply 

 acuminate at tip, sometimes emarginate at end, with outer point 

 subfalcate; coloration usually more varied, though sometimes plain 

 cinnamon-rufous in both sexes. 



Bill much shorter than head, broadly cuneate in vertical profile, 

 the lateral outlines straight or very faintly convex, its width at nos- 

 trils considerably greater than its depth at same point ; culmen 

 more or less distinctly ridged, nearly straight for most of its length, 

 rather strongly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla distinctly 

 but not conspicuously uncinate; gonys more or less distinctly con- 

 vex, much longer than mandibular rami, obsoletely or not at all

 longest, the sixth and tenth, successively, shorter, the ninth (in 

 adult males only) only about half as long as eighth (or a little more), 

 acuminate at tip, or sometimes emarginate, with outer point longer

 late; middle toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus, its basal 

 phalanx wholly adherent to outer and for at least half its length to 

 inner toe; hallux slightly shorter than inner toe but decidedly 

 stouter, its basal pad (tylarus) only slightly expanded and flattened. 



Plumage and coloration. — Contour feathers broad and blended, 

 those of the pileum, however, elongated and more or less distinctly 

 outlined, capable of erection into a bushy crest. Adult males usually 

 varied in color, the pileum (sometimes back also) glossy black, rest 

 of upper parts gray or mixed black and gray, with white wing-edgings, 

 the under parts gray or whitish; sometimes the upper parts (except 

 pileum) plain olive-green (with or without gray on hindneck), one 

 species with breast and under wing-coverts yellow; in one species 

 the under parts barred with blackish. Adult females and young 

 males (adult males also in one species) plain cinnamon-rufous above

 Novit. Zool., Feb., 1906, 27 (Caparo and Pointe Gourde, Trinidad; crit.). 



According to Hellmayr (as cited above) the dark-colored birds of this species from 

 Trinidad are not the same as those from the Upi:)er Amazon Valley (true P. p. niger), 

 which, together with specimens from Cumana and the Orinoco Valley, Venezuela, 

 Tobago, and Bogota, are, according to the same author, identical in coloration with the 

 type of P. cinereiventris Sclater, from Santa Marta. I can not understand this, for all 

 of the considerable series of specimens that I have seen from the islands of Trinidad 

 and Tobago are easily distinguished from mainland examples by their much darker 

 (blackish or blackish-clouded) under parts, while from Bogota 1 have only seen P. 

 dorsalis Sclater, a bird with very pale gray under parts and a gray collar across the hind- 

 neck. In fact, I have only seen one example from any part of Colombia that is as dark 

 beneath as birds from Venezuela, the one in question being among a large series of spec- 

 imens from Bonda and other places in Santa Marta, which, except for thisonespecimen, 

 are all similar to the birds from Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua (Pacific slope).

a Venezuelan specimens are included in the range of this form by Chrpman (Auk, 

 xiv, 1897, 369) and those from Trinidad by Hellmayr (Novit. Zool., xiii, 1906, 27); 

 but I can not agree to this. Phelps' specimens from Cumanacoa and San Antonio, 

 Venezuela, are before me, and while they certainly are not typical P. p. nigcr, they 

 are, in my judgment, nearer that form than P. p. dnereiventris. All of a considerable 

 series from Trinidad are certainly much nearer to the former than to the latter. A 

 single specimen from Bonda, Santa Marta, Colombia, is precisely like Venezuelan 

 specimens in coloration, all the others examined being typical dnereiventris. In 

 other words, while these dark colored birds from Trinidad and Venezuela very likely 

 are not true P. p. niger, as Hellmayr insists, they certainly are not the same form 

 as the "common run' ' of Colombian birds (precisely like those from Panama and the 

 Pacific slope of Costa Rica and Nicaragua) which we have been accustomed to call 

 P. dnereiventris. Evidently, therefore, if, as Hellmayr states, the type of P. dne- 

 reiventris agrees with the Venezuela and Trinidad si)ecimens it will be necessary to 

 give a new name to the form which I here call P. p. dnereiventris.

Adult female. — Possibly the same as P. ornatus Q\\evx\e (see p. 842),

 Sclater, and Salvin and Godman, respectively: 



"Above dusky olive, head darker, lores w^hite; wings blackish 

 edged with yellowish rufus; tail black, broadly tipped with pale 

 ochraceous; beneath pale grey-olive; middle of belly, crissum, and 

 under wing-coverts yellowish." (Sclater, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., ^fiv, 

 1888, 347.) 



"Differs [from the female of P. major] in having an olive-colored 

 back and a red instead of black crown." (Salvin and Godman, Biol. 

 Centr.-Am., Aves, ii, 1889, 128.) Notwithstanding the statement of 

 the authors cited that the female has a "red" (i e., rufescent) crown, 

 they figure that sex, on pi. 43, fig. 3, with the pileum darl' olive!

6 This species seems to be rare in collections and not as well understood as most of its 

 congeners. Much confusion evidently exists as to the adult female, and it is very 

 probable the bird described by Mr. Cherrie as P. ornaius is in reality the female of the 

 species. If so, the gap (existing at present in its range between northwestern Nicaragua 

 (Corinto) and western Panama woidd, in a measure, be filled by the several Costa Rican 

 records of P. "ornatus."

or broader. That from Venezuela, on the other hand, has the barring of the under 

 parts much less distinct than in any of the specimens from Colombia and Peru (which 

 are all much alike in this respect), being, in fact, almost obsolete, and the general color 

 of the under parts is very much less yellow'ish, especially on the tliroat. The back of 

 this Venezuelan specimen is also much less uniformly black, being much intermixed 

 with gray, the upper back and lower hindneck being mostly gi-ay. The female from 

 Costa Rica is much like those from Colombia and Peru, but has the throat much more 

 strongly olive-yellow. (See Berlepsch and Taczanowski, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1884,

 iZa(/TOS?o?ni(so Cabanis and Heine, Mus, Hein., ii, Oct., 1859, 84. (Type, Tityra 



atricapiUa Vieillot. ) 



Rather small Cotingidie (wing about 90-105 mm.) with second 

 phalanx of outer toe entirely free from middle toe, planta tarsi quasi- 

 taxaspidean, outermost (tenth) primary equal to or longer than fifth, 

 tall not longer than wing to end of secondaries, and bill much shorter 

 than head and nearly as deep as broad at base, the adult males with- 

 out bright colors except, sometimes, a throat-patch of rose-red or 

 pink. 



Bill much shorter than head, stout, its depth at nostril nearly equal 

 to its width at same point; culmen faintly ridged, nearly straight to 

 near tip, where strongly and rather abruptly decurved, the tip of the 

 maxilla obviously but rather minutel}^ uncinate; gonys much longer 

 than mandibular rami, not at all ridged, faintly convex, its basal 

 angle rather prominent; maxillary tomium nearly straight, distinctly 

 notched subterminally. Nostril exposed, very small, nearly circular, 

 with narrow superior and posterior membrane. Rictal bristles dis- 

 tinct. Wing moderate, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries 

 by length of exposed culmen, or more; sixth, seventh, and eighth 

 primaries longest, the tenth about equal to fifth, the ninth, in adult 

 males, only about half as long as eighth, its tip abruptly contracted 

 and subacuminate. Tail shorter than wing to end of secondaries, 

 chstinctly rounded, the rectrices moderately broad, with rounded tip. 

 Tarsus rather long (decidedly longer than middle toe with claw, about 

 or nearly one-third as long as tail), its scutellation quasi-taxaspidean, 

 the planta tarsi having along each side a single continuous row of 

 rather large subquadrate or lozenge-shaped scutella, the two rows in 

 contact along the posterior edge, but their junction interrupted by 

 occasional small scutella interposed at each point of lateral division; 

 middle toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus, its basal phalanx 

 wholly, or for much the greater part, adherent to outer toe, nearl}^ as 

 much united to inner toe; hallux nearly as long as inner toe, stouter, 

 its basal pad (tylarus) flattened and slightly expanded, its extended 

 inner edge continuous with that of inner toe. 



Plumage and coloration. — Contour feathers broad and blended : heatl 

 normally feathered, with feathers of pileum (especially those of 

 occipit and hinder crown elongated and distinctly outlined, forming, 

 when erected, a bushy crest. Adult males black, or gray with black 

 pileum, above, the scapulars with much concealed white; under parts

dusky, gray, or whitish, with or without a patch of rose-red or pink on 

 throat; adult females and young males rufous or brown above, the 

 pileum sometimes black or dusky, or grayish with rusty pileum, wings, 

 and tail, the lower parts more or less buffy or cinnamomeous. 



Nidijication. — Nest an enormous mass of vegetable materials with 

 the entrance to the nest proper at the lower side. Eggs (of P. aglaisR 

 sumicJirasti) " white, beautifully marked with pencillings of a pinkish 

 red and occasional spots of the same color," these markings ''much

Adult tnale. — Pileum and nape l)la('k, the feathers margined with 

 sHghtly glossy bhie-black; rest of upper parts phiin slightly glossy 

 slate-black, the innermost scapulars with much concealed white, 

 chiefly on inner webs; sides of head and neck and entire under parts 

 plain sooty slate color, the chin and upper throat slightly paler and 

 more brownish; bill blackish brown or dusky horn color (in dried 

 skins); legs and feet dusky horn color (more or less bluish in life?);

 exposed culmen, 15.5-16.5 (16); tarsus, 22.5-24.5 (23.1); middle toe, 

 15-16 (15.4).'' 



Adult female. — Pileum and nape plain deep brown (prouts to be- 

 tween Vandyke and sepia), slightly paler on forehead, the feathers of 

 occiput and nape (sometimes of crown also) usually slightly tipped 

 or terminally margined with black; back, scapulars, rump, and 

 upper tail-coverts dark brownish gray or grayish brown (slightly 

 paler posteriorly), the hindneck similar, but more brownish ; wings and 

 tail deep brown (sepia or warm sepia), the outer surface of greater 

 wing-coverts and secondaries (sometimes edges of primaries also) 

 more russet-brown; latero-frontal plumules pale russet or brownish 

 buffy; lores pale grayish, tinged with pale brownish buff; rest of 

 sides of head light russet (the suborbital region sometimes more 

 buffy); chin pale dull buffy, deepening into pale brownish buff to 

 cinnamon-buff or clay color on throat and upper chest, this fading 

 into pale grayish buify on breast, the remaining under parts pale 

 bulfy gray or grayish buffy, the under tail-coverts and thighs light 

 brownish (the latter more btiffy or cinnamomeous) ; axillars and 

 under wing-coverts wood brown or cinnamon-brown; mner webs of 



Platypsans aglaix, and I am also unable to state in precise terms the differences that 

 may exist between them and the adult female and young of P. atricapillus. The 

 difficulty is in large measure owing to the strong probability that many specimens 

 which according to their labels are alleged to be females are in reality young males, 

 for there is no other way of accounting for the gi'eat variation in coloring, except by the 

 hypothesis that the females of certain forms (notably P. aglaix aglaix and P. a. sunii- 

 chrasti) have two very different phases of phmiage — a gi'ayish brown and a rufous or 

 tawny one. Certain other forms seem not to vary in this way, the females of P. a. 

 hijpophxus and P. a. latiroslris being apparently alwaj'^s of the rufous-tawny style, 

 while those of P. a. albirentris seem always to be brownish gray above.

 and, usually, color of throat more purplish red (burnt carmine or 

 pomegranate-purple) and frequentl}^ more restricted (especially in 

 examples from Guatemala and British Honduras, in some of which 

 the red is more or less obsolete) ; adult female much darker and more 

 rufescent than that of P. a. aglaise, the pileum often sooty black or 

 slate-black, the back, etc., varying from deep russet-brown (nearly 

 prouts brown) to burnt-umber and rufous-chestnut, the under parts

Many Guatemala specimens have the rose color of the throat much reduced in 

 extent, while in some it is obsolete, as is also the case with one from British Honduras; 

 and as a rule both sexes (females especially) are somewhat more intensely colored 

 than those from Mexico. The Guatemalan series consists, in fact, distinctly for the 

 most part, of intergrades between P. a. sumichrasii and P. a. hypophxus. 



b I am unable to allocate certain localities in Guatemala, Oaxaca, and Vera Cruz 

 mentioned in the Biologia Centrali- Americana, {Aves, ii, 122) for the reason that some 

 of them I can not find on maps available to me, while in other cases it would be 

 necessary to see specimens beiore their correct identification could be made.

 in P. a. aglaix and other forms (except Guatemalan examjiles of P. a. sumichrasti, 

 which are otherwise very different) and of a very different hue from the usual color 

 in any of the other forms. The female from Villanueva, Guatemala (which I have not

" Not having been able to examine a single South American example of this species, 

 1 am compelled at present to follow Doctor Sclater and Messrs. Salvin and Godmau in 

 considering the birds from South America and those from Central America inseparable. 

 For convenience, however, and especially in view of the possibility that careful com- 

 pari.^on may, as in the case of Tityra semifasciata and T. s. personata (united by the 

 authors mentioned), show constant and easily delined differences, 1 arrange the refer- 

 ences in the synonouiy as if there were really two forms.

. Medium-sized Cotingidge (wing about 118-145 mm.) with large, 

 stout, and strongly uncinate bill, small, circular, nonoperculate, 

 exposed nostrils, naked loral and orbital regions, and coloration of 

 black, white, and gray. 



Bill shorter than head, stout, its depth at nostrils about equal to 

 its width at same point and nearly equal to length of gonys; culmen 

 broad and rounded (not at all ridged), nearly straight or gently 

 convex for most of its length, strongly and rather abruptly decurved 

 terminally, the tip of maxilla strongly uncinate ; gonys about as long 

 as mandibular rami, faintly convex, ascending terminally, and with a 

 distinct median ridge; maxillary tomium nearly straight (faintly con- 

 cave anteriorly), distmctly notched subterminally. Nostril exposed, 

 small, roundish, without adjacent membrane. Rictal bristles absent. 

 Wing moderate, with longest primaries exceeding secondaries by much 

 more than length of tarsus; seventh and eighth primaries longest, the 

 sixth and tenth successively shorter; ninth primary, in adult males, 

 very small (not more than half as long as first), narrow, acuminate, 

 and subfalcate. Tail about two-thirds as long as wing, even, the 

 rectrices broad, with rounded tip. Tarsus about as long as exposed 

 culmen, its scutellation modified pycnaspidean, the outer side being 

 mostly broken up into small roundish or hexagonal scutella, like those 

 of the planta tarsi; middle toe, with claw, about as long as tarsus, 

 its basal phalanx mostly adherent to outer toe, about half united to 

 inner toe; outer toe reaching (without claw) to nearly the end of sub- 

 terminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe to about the middle of 

 the same; hallux decidedly shorter than inner toe, not conspicuously 

 stouter, its basal pad (tylarus) broad and flattened, with extruded 

 inner edge continuous with that of inner toe. 



Plumage arid coloration. — Contour feathers broad and blended, the 

 plumage compact; loral and orbital regions and anterior portion of

The last reference is placed with the synonymy of this form, not because I believe 

 the form untenable but because I have not the necessary material for a clear under- 

 standing of the South American forms. However, one of the characters ascribed to 

 T. s. fortis can not be relied on, namely, the entire absence of black on inner web of the 

 outermost rectrix, one specimen from Chapada, Mattogrosso, southwestern Brazil, not 

 having a trace of the usual black spot.

Besides averaging decidedly smaller than those from other parts of Mexico (lees so 

 than those from Guatemala and Honduras, however), Yucatan examples are appreci- 

 ably paler, especially females, which have the general color of the upper parts browner. 

 It is possible the Yucatan birds (as in the case of so many other species) may require 

 separation . 



b The specimens examined from Naranjo, Guatemala, and Tapana, Oaxaca, are, if 

 correctly sexed, intermediate between this form and T. s. griseiceps. The sex of the 

 latter was not determined by the collector. Both may be young males instead of adult 

 females.

C. ornatiis Geoffroy St.-Hilaire). 

 Alticeps GisTEL, Naturg. des Thierreichs fiir hohere Schulen, 1848, p. viii. (New 



name for Cephaloptcrus Geoffroy St.-Hilaire.) 



Very large, uniform black Cotingidae, with an erect umbrella-like 

 crest. 



Bill shorter than head, broad and rather depressed at base, its 

 width at nostrils considerably exceeding its depth at same point; 

 culmen forming a broad rounded ridge, gradually curved from base, 

 more strongly so terminally, the tip of maxilla distinctly but obtusely 

 uncinate; maxillary tomium distinctly notched subterminally, gently 

 concave or nearly straight behind notch, slightly convex basally; 

 gonys longer than mandibular rami, but decidedl}^ shorter than dis- 

 tance from nostril to tip of maxilla; interramal space broader basally 

 than long. Nostrils exposed, obliquely broadly oval. Rictal bristles 

 well developed, recurved. Wing long and broad, with longest pri- 

 maries exceeding secondaries by about the length of exposed culmen; 

 sixth, seventh, and eighth primaries longest, the ninth shorter than 

 fif lIi, the tenth about equal to first (both decidedly shorter than long- 

 est secondaries), all of normal form. Tail about half as long as wing, 

 disanclly rounded, the rectrices broad, with rounded or faintly acu- 

 minate tip. Tarsus about as long as mandible (to commencement 

 of malar feathering), its scutellation typically pycnaspidean; middle 

 toe, with claw, about as long as tarsus, its basal phalanx completely 

 adherent to outer toe, more than half adherent to inner toe; outer toe 

 decidedly but not conspicuously shorter than middle toe, the inner 

 (without claw) reaching to about middle of subterminal phalanx of 

 middle toe; hallux (%\athout claw) decidedly shorter than inner toe 

 but much stouter, its basal pad (tylarus) broad and flattened, its con- 

 spicuously extruded inner edge continuous with that of the inner toe ; 

 claws moderate in size, rather strongly curved, broad, and com- 

 pressed. 



Plumage and coloration. — Contour feathers in general broad and 

 rounded, distinctly outlined, especially on upper parts; those on sides 

 of head narrower, more blended, with rather conspicuously developed 

 shafis on loral and orbital regions. Pileum with a very conspicuous 

 erec.ile crest of nearly straight more or less rigid feathers, surmounted 

 by an expanded, recurved, loosel}^ webbed tip; this crest is attached 

 to a contractile skin, and when erected and expanded forms a remark- 

 able and wholly unique dome-like or umbrella-shaped ornament. 

 To the center of the foreneck is attached an elongated, slender, pend- 

 ant appendage, covered with imbricated feathers in two species (in 

 one of which it reaches the remarkable length of more than 300 mm..

a "A Procne in hirundinem mutata." 



b The species given by Illiger as examples of his genus Procnias are (1) Ampelis 

 variegata Gmelin, (2) Ampelis carunculata Gmelin?, and (3) Hirundo t'mrfis Temminck 

 {''Ampelis variegata, carunculata? Lin Gmel. Hirundo viridis Temminck catalog"). 

 The first and second of these are members of the present genus. The third is the 

 female or young male of the Tanager-like bird generally known as Procnias tersa, P. 

 viridis, or P. cxrulea; and instead of being the type of the genus Procnias Illiger, as 

 commonly supposed, was the first of the three to be withdrawn from that genus, Vieillot 

 having in 1816 (Analyse, p. 38) based his genus Tersa upon the same species (although 

 the type is given as " Tersine Buff[on]"= J.mpeHs tersa Linnaeus, an unidentified 

 species, while in 1819 (Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat. xxxiii, 401) he renamed the genus, 

 this time calling it Tersina and giving as the type Tersina cserulea Vieillot. Just what 

 the interrogation point following the name carunculata means in Illiger's " Prodromus " 

 it is difficult to determine, but it may have been intended to indicate doubt as to that 

 species really belonging to Procnias; at any rate, the type of Procnias Illiger would, in 

 view of Vieillot's disposition of Hirundo viridis Temminck, necessarily be either 

 Ampelis variegata Gmelin or A. carunculata Gmelin, since Temminck first named and 

 characterized the genus Casmarhinchos (subsequently variously "emended" by other 

 authors) in 1820, the type (by elimination) being Ampelis variegata Gmelin. In other 

 words, Casmarhinchos Temminck is a synonym of Procnias Illiger. 



In view of the fact that Vieillot gives "Tersine Buff [on]" as the type of his genus 

 Tersa, notwithstanding the generic diagnosis evidently was taken from the bird com- 

 monly but erroneously (both as to its generic and specific names) called Procnias tersa, 

 it is difficult to decide whether this name should be used instead of Tersina of later date 

 or not. It is not necessary, however, in the present connection, that this question be 

 decided, it being sufficient to cite the references to the original publication of the 

 names in question, which are as follows: 



Tersa Vieillot, Analyse, 1816, 38 (the diagnosis pertinent, but type given as Tersine of 

 Buffon, a species which has never been satisfactorily identified and which certainly 

 can not be the bird commonly called Procnias tersa'). — Tersina Vieillot, Nouv. Diet. 

 d'Hist. Nat., xxxiii, 1819,401 (type, Tersina cserulea YieiWot). — Procm'as (not of Illiger, 

 1811) Temminck, Man. d'Orn., 2ded., i, 1820, p. Ixiii (type, Hirundo viridis Temminc'k) . 



As a consequence of this change in the generic name, the family name Procniatidaj 

 (Ridgway, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., xviii, no. 1076, June 24, 1896, 449) must be changed 

 to Tersidic or Tersinidse, according to which of the two names, Tersa or Tersina, are 

 adopted.

 of commissure in females of some species). Wing long and broad, 

 the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by more than length of 

 tarsus; sixth and seventh, or sixth to eighth, primaries longest, the 

 tenth about as long as second or third or intermediate between fourth 

 and fifth. Tail about two-thirds as long as wing, even, slightly 

 rounded, or faintly emarginate, the rectrices moderately broad, with 

 rounded or subacuminate tip. Tarsus much shorter than commis- 

 sure, its scutellation typically pycnaspidean; middle toe, with claw, 

 slightly longer than tarsus, its basal phalanx united for greater part to 

 outer toe, for nearly as much to inner toe; outer toe decidedly shorter 

 than middle one, very little longer than inner toe; hallux decidedly 

 shorter than inner toe, but much stouter, its basal pad (tylarus) broad 

 and flattened, with the conspicuously extruded inner edge continuous 

 with that of inner toe; claws rather short, broad, and compressed. 



Plumage, coloration, and ornaments. — Contour plumage soft, blended; 

 no crest or other elongated feathers about head or neck. Adult males 

 with more or less elongated, usually naked, caruncular appendages to 

 forepart of head, br on tliroat, or else the throat, together with loral, 

 orbital, and malar regions, denuded, the color of the plumage entirely 

 white, white w^th brown head and black wings, or chestnut-rufous 

 with white head and neck. Adult females destitute of appendages or 

 wattles, the plumage plain olive-green above, striped with olive-green 

 and yellowish beneath. 



Nidification. — Unknown. 



Range. — Costa Rica to southeastern Brazil, but apparently absent 

 from Amazon Valley. (Four species.) 



Notwithstanding the great amount of difference between adult 

 males of this group, I am inclined to consider them as constituting a 

 single genus. In every other superspecific group of the family to

which generic rank is given in the present work, the generic characters 

 arc apparent (only to a less degree) in the females as well as in the 

 males; but such is not the case (so far as I am able to discover, at 

 least) in the present genus, the females of which are not only closely 

 similar in coloration but in external structural details also.

« Owing to an insufficient representation of adult feinales and young males of the 

 several species (there being no female of C. niveus in the National Museum collection) 

 I am not able to give a satisfactory key. The species are very much alike, but prob- 

 ably a good series of specimens would enable one to distinguish them with certainty.

 and only ten reetrices! This necessitates the removal of the genus 

 from the Turdidse, and there being no other group into which it can 

 be properly fitted, I propose a new family, Zeledoniidae, for its accom- 

 modation, with the following characters:

rump; wings fuscous, the quills, greater coverts, and primary coverts 

 edged with brownish gray, the outer web of outermost primary nearly 

 all white; lesser wing-coverts and upper tail-coverts cinnamonieous; 

 tail black, the two middle feathers fuscous, margined with brownish 

 gra}", the exterior web of outermost pair of rectrices edged with 

 white; occiput, cervix, and sides of neck pinkish cinnamonieous; 

 crown, ''horns," lores, cheeks, and jugular crescent black; auriculars 

 yellowish white washed with grayish; forehead, superciliary stripe, 

 and postocular streak yellowish white; chin and throat pale primrose 

 yellow; flanks, thighs, and sides of breast and of body light bro\vnish 

 cinnamon; rest of lower parts, including lining of wings, white. 



''This new race is in color very similar to Otocoris alpestris leuco- 

 laema, but is more grayish above, at least when in good plumage; 

 and has the eyebrow usuall}^ more j^ellowish; furthermore, the 

 greatly inferior size of Otocoris a. enertera distinguishes it at once. 

 From Otocoris alpestris actia, whose range it approaches most closely, 

 it differs very much more than from either Otocoris a. ammopliila or 

 0. a. leucolaema, being strikingly paler and more grayish throughout, 

 as well as somewhat smaller. 



"The t}^e specimen above described still retains some of the 

 brownish gray edgings of crown, jugulum, and cervix, but otherwise 

 represents the perfect breeding plumage. Wlien badly worn, 0. a. 

 enertera looks more like 0. a. ammopliila than when in fresh condi- 

 tion, though it is still more grayish and pinkish above, and of course 

 smaller. Otocoris alpestis enertera appears to be non-migratory; and 

 its range, so far as known, extends in Lower California from Santa 

 Rosalia Bay to the neighborhood of Magdalena Bay."

 Vieillot (especially T^. pusiUus Coues), but bill much broader and more 

 depressed basally, its width at frontal antise equal to distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla and more than twice as great as its depth at 

 same point, and rictal bristles stronger. 



Bill about half as long as head, broadly triangular in vertical profile, 

 its width at frontal antia? more than twice its depth at same point, and 

 equal to distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen nearly straight 

 to near tip, where slightly decurved, the tip of maxilla very slightly 

 uncinate; gonys faintly convex, much longer than mandibular rami; 

 maxillary tomium nearly straight, distinctly notched subterminally. 

 Nostril exposed, rather large, longitudinally oval, with broad mem- 

 brane above for whole length and below for basal half. Rictal bristles 

 (two or three) strongly developed, the bristly tips to leathers of chin 

 and frontal antise distinct, the latter extending much beyond nostril.

 by not more than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; seventh and 

 sixth primaries longest, the fifth and eighth successively a little 

 shorter, the ninth shorter than first, the tenth (outermost) a little 

 more than half as long as ninth. Tail as long as wing from bend to 

 end of secondaries, slightly double-rounded, the rectrices rather nar- 

 row. Tarsus rather long and slender (about twice as long as exposed 

 culmen and one-third as long as wing) ; middle toe, with claw, much 

 shorter than tarsus, its basal phalanx and nearly half of second pha- 

 lanx united to outer toe, the former almost wholly united to inner toe ; 



a In honor of Mr. George Newbold Lawrence.

 (Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat., xi, 1817, 171, based on Contramaestre pardo 

 verdoso corona amarilla Azara, Apunt., ii, 57, no. 156), the South 

 American birds of the species being segregated by him as Elaenia 

 viridicata, as had already been done by Salvador! (Boll. Mus. Zool., 

 etc., Torino, xii, 1897, 15). The three forms which I have recognized 

 (following Mr. Bangs) as Myiopagis placens placens, M. p. accola, and 

 M. p. pallens, respectively, are combined hj Count von Berlepsch 

 imder the name Elaejiia viridicata placens (Proc. Fourth Int. Orn.

 Berlepsch (Proc. Fourth Int. Orn. Congr., Feb., 1907, 416) to E. 

 frantzii jmdico. Whether this diposition of E. hrowni is correct or 

 not, there can be no question that specimens (co-types) in the U. S. 

 National Museum are specifically quite distinct from E. frantzii. If, 

 therefore, E. hroiuni Bangs is identical with E. pudica Sclater the 

 latter should be called Elsenia pudica and not Elsenia frantzii pudica. 



Page 427, last paragraph of footnote: With more ample or satis- 

 factory material than that examined by me. Count von Berlepsch 

 has been able to differentiate several forms among the W^est Indian 

 Elsenix included in the present work under the general heading 

 Elsenia martinica 7nartinica, as follows: 



(/) Elxnia martinica [martinica}. Islands of Marie Galante, Guadeloupe, Dominica, 

 Martinique, and Santa Lucia. (Doubtfully, St. Christopher, Antigua, Montserrat, 

 and Barbados.) 



(2) Elsenia martinica riisii (Sclater). Islands of St. Thomas, St. Bartholomew, and 

 Cura(;ao. (Doubtfully, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Anguilla, St. Eustatius, and Saba.). 

 Differing from E. m. martinica in being smaller and color of upper parts paler and 

 more grayish olive. 



(3) Elsenia martiyiica caymanensis Berlepsch. Islands of Grand Cayman and Little 

 Cayman. Similar in coloration to E. m. riisii but larger. 



(4) Elsenia martinica cinerescens (Ridgway). Islands of Old Providence and St. 

 Andrews, Caribbean Sea. Similar to E. m. martinica but larger; bill, wings, and tail 

 longer; chest and breast more grayish olive and fiammulated with yellow. 



(5) Elsenia martinica complexa Berlepsch. Differing from E. m. martinica in having 

 the abdomen and under tail-coverts pale sulphur yellow, upper parts earthy brown 

 and breast washed with brown. (The brown color is really a discoloration, as suggested 

 l)y Count von Berlepsch, but due to the effect of the peculiar preservative used and 

 not to the " influence of moisture." All specimens collected bj^ C. J. Maynard during 

 the trip when these Elaenias were secured are similarly discolored, and are wholly unfit 

 for scientific comparison.) 



(6) Elsenia martinica remota Berlepsch. Differing from E. m. martinica in having 

 the rump conspicuously suffused with brown, chest and upper breast darker gray, 

 contrasting more strongly with the white of throat, and bill broader. This form is also 

 credited to Mujeres Island, and doubtfully to Holbox and Meco islands (Yucatan), 

 and Half Moon Cay, British Honduras.

 not examined by me, a specimen of the t;y^e (and only kno\\Ti) species 

 having recently been acquired by the U. S. National Museum. In 

 external structure Chirocylla is entirely like Latkria except the 

 primaries, which are remarkably modified, being attenuated and 

 strongly recurved terminally, the tenth (outermost) longest, the 

 eighth and seventh shortest (or at least not longer than the first) 

 and with the tip more attenuated than the others, the ninth and 

 tenth with inner web emarginated or notched sub terminally. In size, 

 relative proportions of different parts, and in coloration (except that 

 the rump, flanks, and under tail-coverts are chestnut) Chirocylla 

 uropygialis closely resembles Latliria fuscocinerea. The primaries are 

 said to be less modified in the female.

Page 780, footnote h: Before Sclater, Cat. Birds, etc., insert: 

 Cotinga cincta. 



Count, von Berlepsch has recentl}^ described as a new species a 

 Cotinga, related to C. ridgwaiji and C. nattererii and possibly the same 

 as the latter, under the name Cotinga simoni (Berlepsch, Proc. Fourth 

 Internat. Orn. Congr., Feb., 1907, 361), from southwestern Colom- 

 bia (San Jose de Rio Dagua and Buenaventura; coll. Count von 

 Berlepsch). He compares it with C. ridgwayi (C. nattererii being pos- 

 sibly unknown to him), from the adult male of which that of C. siniord 

 is said to differ as follows: "The violaceous color of the throat and 

 the middle belly is rather darker, nearly black; the blue of the upper 

 parts is also darker, and the top of the head is shaded with darker 

 violaceous. The blue band on the upper breast is broader. There 

 is a bright blue spot on the upper chin wanting in .the other species. 

 The wings are longer and the bill much longer and broader. The 

 third primary is rather narrower. In all other points, especially in 

 the length of the upper and under tail-coverts, it agrees perfectly 

 with C. rldgivayi. The female is quite differently colored from that 

 of C. amahilis, but agrees very well with the female of C. cayana.^' 



Page 800, footnote a: Specimens from Bogota and Santa Marta, 

 Colombia, have recently been separated as Elaenia, gaimardi hogotensis 

 by Count von Berlepsch (Proc. Fourth Int. Congr., Feb., 1907, 421;

 British Guiana, Caj^enne, and northeastern Brazil have been sepa- 

 rated as Elaenia gaimardi guianensis (Berlepsch, Proc. Fourth Int.
