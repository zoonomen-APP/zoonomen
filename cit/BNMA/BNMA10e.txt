PREFACE V 



Robert T. Moore, Pasadena, and the late J. H. Fleming, Toronto. The 

 total number of specimens thereby made available for study in the present 

 connection is hard to estimate but runs into many thousands. 



As in Part IX, the author has made extensive use of the manuscript 

 notes left by the late Robert Ridgway. His notes covered the diagnoses 

 of genera and higher groups and partial synonymies for many of the 

 species and subspecies. Wherever possible his manuscript has been in- 

 cluded v^fith the minimum of change (other than addition to synonymies) 

 permitted by more recent data. In fact, it has been, and still is, the 

 present author's feeling that this work should be as largely Ridgway's as 

 possible ; thus, for instance, he has kept and included Ridgway's diagnoses 

 of certain genera now relegated to the position of subgenera, and where 

 Ridgway's manuscript gave extensive synonymies for extralimital forms, 

 he has retained them without attempting to supply equally detailed 

 accounts for other extralimital forms. However, all such manuscript 

 material has been thoroughly studied with the specimens and the litera- 

 ture ; nothing has been accepted merely because it was written. From the 

 start, the author has felt himself responsible for the entire contents of 

 this volume and has not considered himself as an editor of an unpublished 

 work. 



Measurements of specimens for use in the preparation were made by 

 the author and by A. L. O'Leary, Dr. E. M. Hasbrouck, and J. S. Webb 

 under the author's supervision. Maj. Allan Brooks contributed (before 

 the present author began this work) a series of notes on the colors of the 

 unfeathered parts of many of the species discussed herein. The outline 

 drawings of generic details, except those previously published, were made 

 partly by E. R. Kalmbach, and partly, under the author's supervision, by 

 Mrs. Aime Awl, of the United States National Museum staff.

Schizognathous, holorhinal, terrestrial, or arboreal rasorial birds with 

 sternum usually deeply 4-notched or cleft (2-notched in Opisthocomi) ;

in Argus). Aftershafts present; neck without lateral apteria; adult 

 downs on pterylae only; wing eutaxic (quintocubital) in Galli and Cra- 

 cidae, diastataxic (aquintocubital) in Megapodii; primaries, 10; rectrices, 

 10 or, usually, more. Nest usually on the ground; eggs numerous (ex- 

 cept in Cracidae), variable in form and coloration. Young ptilopaedic 

 and nidifugous (those of the Megapodii highly so, being able to fly and 

 care for themselves soon after hatching) . 



The following additional external characters may be mentioned : 

 Bill short (usually much shorter than head), generally rather stout, the 

 culmen regularly and rather strongly decurved, the maxilla depressed 

 rather than compressed (except in some Cracidae), its obtuse vaulted tip 

 overhanging the tip of the mandible ; maxillary tomium never dentate or 

 serrate, the mandibular tomium dentate only in Odontophorinae ; nasal 

 fossae naked (except in Tetraonidae and some Cracidae), the horizontal 

 or longitudinal nostril overhung by a corneous operculum. Frontal feath- 

 ers (if present) parted by the backward extension of the culmen. Tibiae 

 always feathered, frequently the tarsi also (at least in part) ; sometimes 

 (in genus Lagopus) the toes also; the tarsi, if unfeathered, usually trans- 

 versely scutellate in front, frequently provided with one or more spurs 

 behind; hallux always present, but varying in relative size and position; 

 anterior toes usually webbed between the basal phalanges ; claws obtuse, 

 slightly curved. Wing strong but relatively short, much rounded, and 

 very concave beneath. Tail excessively variable in shape and develop- 

 ment, the rectrices varying from 8 to 32 in number. 



The Galliformes are nearly cosmopolitan in their distribution, only 

 Polynesia, New Zealand, and the Antarctic regions being without repre- 

 sentatives of the order.^ They are much more numerous in the Northern 

 Hemisphere, to which the typical suborder, Galli, is mostly confined, these 

 being far better represented in the Old World than in America, the large 

 and varied family Phasianidae having its focus in temperate and subtrop- 

 ical Asia. The aberrant superfamily Cracoidea is chiefly confined to the 

 Southern Hemisphere, the Megapodidae to the Australian Region, the 

 Cracidae to the Neotropical Region. One family of Phasianoidea is 

 peculiar to America, this being the Meleagrididae. One phasianoid family 

 (Numididae) is restricted to Africa, another (Tetraonidae) is common to 

 the Palearctic and Nearctic Regions, while the remaining and much more 

 numerous and varied one (Phasianidae) has the widest range of all, 

 every portion of Europe and Asia (except the far Arctic parts), besides 

 portions of the Indo-Malayan and Nearctic Regions, possessing represen- 

 tatives (represented in America not by true pheasants, but only by quail). 



'They are, however, also lacking in certain areas within regions the greater part 

 of which is inhabited by them ; for example, the greater part of the West Indies, 

 and the Revillagigedo and Galapagos island groups. New Zealand formerly possessed 

 a species of Coturnix (C. novae-zealandiae) , but this has become extinct.

The species of Galliformes are very numerous. Peters's Check-list of 

 Birds of the World (vol. ii, 1934, pp. 3-141) enumerates no fewer than 

 94 genera, a considerable number of which contain many forms each.

 Megapodidae or moundfowls are a group of plainly colored terrestrial gallinaceous 

 birds of most remarkable habits. They are unique among birds (as far as 

 known) in their nidification ; for, instead of building a nest and incubating their 

 eggs, several individuals of the same species together scrape up, with their power- 

 ful feet, dead leaves and other rubbish of the forest floor into an immense heap, 

 sometimes as much as 30 feet in diameter, in which their eggs are deposited, then 

 covered with the same material, and left to be hatched by the heat generated by 

 the decomposing mass. The young are hatched with wings sufficiently developed 

 for immediate flight, and after emerging they shift for themselves without any help 

 or protection from their parents. One monotypic genus, Megacephalon, represented 

 by the Males, or Mallee-fowl, of Celebes and Sanghir {M. males), buries its eggs 

 in the warm sand along the seashore. The group is essentially confined to the 

 Australian Region, one species only occurring in Borneo and the Philippines.

Range. — The whole of continental tropical America. 



The Cracidae are arboreal gallinaceous birds that differ from all other 

 Gallinae except the Megapodidae (of the Australian Region) in having 

 the hallux large and on the same level with the anterior toes, and from 

 the Megapodidae in having the legs and feet conspicuously less stout, 

 all the toes shorter ; in having the trachea usually coiled instead of straight ; 

 the presence of two carotid arteries and tufted oil gland, absence of biceps 

 slip, and normal nidification; although, unlike the Tetraonidae, Phasian- 

 idae, and other alectoropode Gallinae, the nest is usually built in a tree, 

 and the eggs, said to be only two in number, are very large in proportion 

 to the size of the bird, plain dull white, and very different in shape and 

 texture of the shell, which is roughly granulated. 



The members of the Cracidae are never of brilliant plumage, though 

 many of them are very handsome birds. They dwell in forests and 

 spend much of their time among the branches of the higher trees, where 

 they build their nests. Easily domesticated, they become excessively 

 tame, gentle, and affectionate. 



The true curassows (subfamily Cracinae), of the genera Crax, Notho- 

 crax, Mitu, and Pauxi, are the largest and finest birds of the family.

being nearly equal in size, though inferior in bulk, to the turkeys. The 

 plumage of the males is usually of a glossy black, the underparts of most 

 species chiefly white; the recurved crest and bright color (yellow or 

 orange) of the cere and (if present) frontal protuberance adding to 

 their fine appearance. They are known to the natives of the countries 

 they inhabit as pavo or pavo del monte (peacock or mountain peacock). 

 Their flesh is held in great esteem, being much like that of the turkey, 

 but richer.

cere and anterior half (more or less) of mandibular rami wholly nude; 

 pileum with a more compressed erectile crest of elongated, rigid termi- 

 nally recurved feathers, and forehead with an egg-shaped tubercle or 

 protuberance. 



Bill deep at base, compressed, its greatest basal width equal to less 

 than three-fourths (sometimes barely two-thirds) its height; culmen 

 strongly decurved, not ridged, much shorter than length of mesorhinium, 

 the latter more or less arched proximally, sometimes much compressed 

 (almost ridged), sometimes broad and flattened basally ; cere and anterior 

 half (more or less) of mandibular rami, sometimes loral and at least 

 part of orbital region also, wholly nude; nostril more or less comma- 

 shaped, rounded anteriorly, acute or subacute posteriorly, in anterior 

 middle portion of cere sometimes touching base of rhinotheca, overhung, 

 at least for proximal half, by a convex membranous operculum. Wing 

 relatively large and broad, the very large and broad secondaries extend- 

 ing beyond tips of primaries ; primaries rigid, strongly rounded, composed 

 of 12 rather rigid, broad^ roundish-tipped rectrices, then decidedly in- 

 curved terminally and slightly but distinctly bent vertically, the tail thus 

 convex above and concave beneath. Tarsus long and stout, less than 

 one-fourth to nearly one-third as long as wing, entirely nude, the acro- 

 tarsium and planta tarsi both with a continuous series of large and 

 broad transverse scutella; middle toe nearly to about two-thirds as long 

 as tarsus, the inner toe reaching about to its penultimate articulation, 

 the outer toe slightly longer; hallux incumbent, longer than first two 

 phalanges of outer toe; claws rather large, strongly curved (especially 

 that of hallux), moderately compressed. 



Plumage and coloration. — Plumage in general rather soft, but feathers 

 distinctly outlined, except on sides and under portion of head and on 

 upper neck, where short and velvety, and abdomen, flanks, and under 

 tail coverts, where very soft and full ; pileum with an erectile compressed 

 crest of elongated, rigid feathers, recurved at tips. Adult males plain 

 black, more or less glossed, especially on upper parts, with greenish, 

 bluish, or purplish, the abdomen, flanks, and under tail coverts — some- 

 times also tips of rectrices — white. Adult female with plumage more 

 or less barred, sometimes with rufescent and ochreous hues predominat- 

 ing; in one species differing from adult male only in having the feathers 

 of the crest barred with white. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Brazil. (Seven species with several 

 additional subspecies. Only a single species, with two races, in the re- 

 gions covered by this work.)

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 13 



CRAX KUBRA RUBRA Linnaeas 



Central American Curassow 



Adult male. — Entire feathering of head, neck, wings, tail, and body 

 black with a very dark greenish gloss, except for the middle and posterior 

 part of the abdomen, the flanks, and the under tail coverts, which are 

 white; in some cases the rectrices are slightly margined with white; the 

 feathers of the lower back and rump are short and often reveal their 

 dark brownish bases, causing this area to appear somewhat mixed black 

 and dull sepia, iris red; cere with swollen wattle pale yellow to bright 

 yellow, tip of bill somewhat duskier ; tarsi and toes grayish "horn color." 



Adult female. — Extremely variable, the plumages falling into at least 

 three phases, which, as far as present data indicate, are all equally adult : 



1. Dark phase: Feathers of head and neck and upper two-thirds of 

 throat blackish broadly crossed subterminally with white, causing a barred 

 or sometimes a scalloped appearance, the white areas much smaller on 

 the sides of the head than on the chin, throat, and sides and back of 

 the neck, making the lores, circumorbital area, cheeks, and auriculars 

 definitely blacker in appearance; crest feathers black with a broad white 

 band and sometimes a narrow basal one ; posterior part of neck, lower 

 throat, upper breast, scapulars, and interscapulars dark slate black with 

 a slight greenish gloss, the scapulars and interscapulars more or less 

 washed or edged with dark warm sepia to mars brown; back and rump 

 rich dark chestnut-brown somewhat mottled or tinged with blackish; 

 upper wing coverts bright chestnut with a slight suffusion of orange- 

 rufous, the feathers with dusky shafts and irregularly mottled with dusky 

 fuscous to blackish; primaries and outer secondaries bright chestnut 

 mottled with black and with the shaft edged with blackish on the inner 

 web; in some specimens the outer webs unmottled, in others both webs 

 are heavily sprinkled with black markings ; inner secondaries generally 

 darker, much more heavily mottled with blackish, and with narrow 

 whitish transverse irregular marks on the outer webs ; in some specimens 

 the inner secondaries are more blackish than chestnut and blend easily

into the dark interscapulars ; upper tail coverts blackish washed or edged 

 with dark warm sepia and with a faint greenish gloss ; rectrices variable, 

 in some specimens all are uniform blackish with a greenish gloss ; m 

 others the median pair are heavily vermiculated with dull orange-chestnut ; 

 in still others the outer webs of all the tail feathers have incomplete, 

 narrow, irregular, white bars and whitish tips ; lower breast and sides 

 tawny-russet paling into light ochraceous-tawny to light ochraceous-buff 

 on the adbomen, flanks, thighs, and under tail coverts ; under wing coverts 

 chestnut vermiculated with blackish ; bill yellowish, darker and somewhat 

 olive-brown basally; tarsi and toes dull "pinkish gray." 



2. Red phase: Similar to the dark phase but with the lower throat, 

 entire breast, the scapulars, interscapulars, entire back, rump, upper wing 

 coverts, and remiges bright orange-chestnut to Sanford's brown, the 

 inner secondaries obscurely and incompletely barred with blackish, and 

 the rectrices broadly barred black chestnut and cinnamon-buff, the chest- 

 nut usually confined to the median two pairs and edged with black, not 

 coming directly into contact with the buff bars, of which there are seven 

 or eight, including the terminal one. 



3. Barred-backed phase: Feathers of head and neck white with small 

 black tips, the whole area definitely much whiter than in the two phases 

 described above ; the crest mostly white instead of black barred with white ; 

 the black tips practically absent in the feathers of the chin and upper 

 throat; lower throat, upper breast, posterior part of hindneck, and inter- 

 scapulars broadly barred with black and white, the bars about equal in 

 width (8 mm.) in one specimen, the black ones wider than the white 

 ones in several others; scapulars, upper wing coverts, and secondaries 

 very conspicuously banded with broad bars of pinkish buff to cinnamon- 

 buff, the dark (wider) bars dull deep chestnut edged with black or, in 

 some birds, and especially on the interscapulars, almost solid black; 

 primaries pinkish buff to cinnamon-buff, terminally suffused with pinkish 

 cinnamon and banded with orange-cinnamon to mikado brown, these 

 dark bands more widely spaced (narrower than the pale interspaces) and 

 more developed on the inner than the outer webs; on the innermost 

 primaries the dark bands have some blackish margins; back and rump 

 pale cinnamon-buff barred with black-edged chestnut bands; upper tail 

 coverts and median rectrices like the scapulars and secondaries, the outer 

 rectrices becoming blacker and the pale bars narrower, sometimes almost 

 disappearing in the outermost pair ; underparts of body paler than in the 

 other phases — the lower breast and sides pale ochraceous-buff, abdomen, 

 flanks, thighs, and under tail coverts as in other phases; under wing 

 coverts ochraceous-buff speckled with dull chestnut.^^ 



" This plumage is very different from anything else seen in this species ; the only 

 character elsewhere exhibited that approaches it is in the tail of the rufous phase. I 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 15 



Suhadidt mwZ^.— Similar to the adult but without the swollen wattle on 

 the cere. 



Juvenal male. — Similar to the adult female dark phase but with the 

 entire breast and upper abdomen blackish, the abdominal feathers basally 

 pale chestnut, which color shows through the black; thighs with dusky- 

 edges and tips to each of the feathers producing a scalloped appearance ; 

 and entire back and scapulars blackish like the interscapulars ; primaries 

 darker — very dark chestnut on the outer webs, dark sepia on the in- 

 ner ones. 



Juvenal female.^* — Three phases, as follows : 



1. Dark phase: Similar to the adult of the same phase but with the 

 secondaries and the long scapulars mottled with white, the irregular 

 elongated whitish marks surrounded with black; the central pair of 

 rectrices vermiculated black and chestnut and similarly mottled with white ; 

 the next pair with a few white marks on the outer webs ; upper tail coverts 

 dark chestnut vermiculated with black like the median rectrices but with 

 no white, breast very dark chestnut, not black, the lower breast, upper 

 abdomen, and sides barred more or less with dusky fuscous and 

 ochraceous-buff ; occasional feathers have the buff replaced by white; 

 thighs similarly barred with fuscous; crest with several white bars. 



2. Red phase: Similar to the corresponding adult but with the lower 

 breast, abdomen, and thighs barred with fuscous, and the remiges crossed 

 by numerous rather fine wavy blackish bars ; crest with several white bars. 



3. Barred-backed phase: Similar to the corresponding adult but the 

 crest feathers with several white bars instead of one very broad one; 

 upper abdomen and sides and flanks barred with fuscous-black. 



Natal down. — Down of head, upperparts generally, breast, sides, flanks, 

 and thighs grayish warm buff, abdomen white ; the chin also whitish ; tip 

 and sides of head with blackish spots which tend to become connected 

 into longitudinal stripes on the hindneck and back (where there are one 

 median and two lateral stripes separated by slightly more grayish, less 

 buffy, down than that of the upperparts generally; bill dusky yellowish, 

 tending toward lead grayish on the maxillary tomium; tarsi and toes 

 pale ochraceous-salmon. (descr. ex col. fig. in Heinroth, Journ. fiir Orn., 

 Ixxix, 1931, pi. xvii, facing p. 282). 



have seen four examples of the barred-backed form "chapmani Nelson," all females. 

 As far as I have been able to discover, all the known specimens of this type come 

 from Campeche and Yucatan; the plumage is not represented from other parts of 

 the range of rubra and is not known to occur in the Cozumel Island subspecies 

 griscomi. It is impossible to decide the status of chapmani definitely; it may be a 

 color phase of rubra as here treated, and as considered by several recent authors, 

 or it may be a distinct species. A similar case in South America is to be found in 

 Crax grayi Ogilvie-Grant and in Crax pitiima Pelzeln. 

 " There seems to be no subadult stage that may be told from skins.

Large Cracidae (length about 558-890 mm. but less bulky and more 

 slender than Crax), with bill relatively small and not compressed, loral, 

 orbital, and gular regions nude, the last with a median wattle or dewlap 

 (sometimes not evident in dried skins), pileum with decumbent but 

 erectile crest of broad, flattened soft feathers, tail as long as or longer 

 than wing, and coloration mostly brownish or olivaceous, without bars, 

 usually without any solid black, and sometimes with whitish streaks on 

 underparts. 



Bill relatively small (only about half as long as head), its depth at 

 base about equal to its width at same point; culmen about as long as 

 nude portion of mesorhinium, gradually decurved, broadly rounded on 

 top, the rhinotheca slightly to decidedly broader than deep at base; 

 mesorhinium straight or very slightly convex toward base, gently ascend- 

 ing proximally; nostril relatively rather large, narrowly elliptical or slit- 

 like to comma-shaped (broadly rounded anteriorly, acute or subacute 

 posteriorly), its posterior half or more overhung by a convex membrane, 

 its anterior end touching base of rhinotheca, or nearly so. Wing large 

 and broad, the longer primaries and secondaries about equal in length 



" ^Merrem had two species, P. leucolophos (p. 43), which = Crax cumanensis 

 Jacquin (a Pipile), and P. jacupema (p. 39), which is doubtfully referred to P. 

 marail Gmelin; Sclater and Salvin, P.Z.S. 1870, 523, say it 'must always remain 

 doubtful' what species was intended by Merrem under this name.'' (Richmond, MS.) 



In 1816 Vieillot (Analyse, p. 49) gave only Marail Buffon (= Penelope marail 

 Gmelin) under the generic term Penelope; while in 1832 Wagler (Isis, p. 1226) 

 included P. pipile (= Pipile jacuntinga) , P. cumanensis (= Pipile cumanensis), and 

 P. aburri (^ Aburria abitrri).

all faintly but distinctly bent downward terminally (the upper surface 

 slightly convex, the under side slightly concave). Tarsus moderately long 

 and stout (about one-fourth as long as wing), the acrotarsium with a 

 single continuous row of broad, transverse scutella, the planta tarsi with 

 small irregular scutella, then large and more or less hexagonal, on 

 upper and lower portion, tending to arrangement in double longitudinal 

 series; middle toe about three-fourths as long as tarsus, the outer toe 

 reaching to a little beyond penultimate articulation of middle toe, the 

 inner slightly to decidedly shorter ; hallux shorter than first two phalanges 

 of outer toe; claws rather long and strongly curved, moderately com- 

 pressed; a well-developed web between basal phalanges of anterior toe. 



Plumage and coloration. — Entire loral and orbital regions (extensively) 

 completely nude, the throat also nude but with scattered hairlike feathers, 

 the chin and upper throat more or less feathered; feathers of pileum 

 elongated, but broad and flattened, forming when erected a bushy crest; 

 plumage in general moderately firm, the feathers, even on neck, distinctly 

 outlined, except on abdomen and under tail coverts, where soft and 

 semidecomposed. Upperparts plain brownish, olivaceous, dull olive- 

 greenish, or dusky dull bluish green, the pileum sometimes black, white 

 with dusky shaft streaks, or with white edges to feathers, one species 

 with eight outer primaries white with dusky tip and base, one with wing 

 coverts, back, etc., edged with white, and one with tail tipped with 

 cinnamon-rufous; under parts brownish, usually with feathers of chest 

 or breast edged with white, the abdomen, etc., sometimes cinnamon-rufous 

 or chestnut. Sexes alike in color. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to southern Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru.

Penelope purpurascens perspicax (extralimital)" 



"The above description, so far as proportions are concerned, is based essentially 

 on P. purpurascens and P. montagnii, other species not being available at the time 

 of writing. P. montagnii differs from P. purpurascens in greater extent of feather- 

 ing of chin, which extends over much of the throat, relatively longer primaries or 

 shorter secondaries, much greater restriction of nude circumorbital and loral area, 

 and some other characters, but it is doubtful that the genus Stegnolaema Sclater 

 and Salvin, of which it is the type, should be granted recognition.

 tail feathers with a little brighter sheen and averaging slightly more olive, 

 less bronzy ; lores bare except for some sparse black bristlelike feathers ; 

 circumocular area bare; chin and upper throat also bare except for a 

 very few black hairlike feathers, a malar band of feathers from the 

 posterior end of the mandibular ramus, broadening over the auriculars 

 to extend dorsad to the feathers of the occiput and caudally to the sides 

 of the upper throat, dark fuscous ; rest of sides of neck, lower throat, 

 and breast dark fuscous with a faint bronzy brownish gloss, each feather 

 laterally narrowly edged with white; abdomen, sides, flanks, thighs, and 

 under tail coverts like the back and rump; under wing coverts dark 

 fuscous; iris carmine-red; circumorbital skin and lores violaceous-black;

 veloped; inner remiges and median rectrices with a little more purplish 

 sheen. 



Juvenal (only one male and one unsexed bird seen). — Much paler than 

 adult or immature birds, the fuscous of the latter replaced by dusky 

 earth brown to dull sepia; no white marks on the upperparts and very 

 faintly present on the breast; scapulars, upper wing coverts, inner 

 secondaries, upper tail coverts, and rectrices sepia abundantly flecked and

 Penelopides van Rossem, Condor, xliv, 1942, 77. (Type, by original designation, 



Ortalida wagleri (Gray).) 



Small, plainly colored Cracidae (length about 412-649 mm.), with sides 

 of gular area nude, divided longitudinally by a narrow feathered area on 

 median strip. 



Bill relatively small (from frontal feathers less than half as long as 

 head), broader than deep at base of exposed culmen; culmen rather 

 strongly decurved terminally, not ridged; nostril longitudinal, narrowly 

 elliptical to rather broadly fusiform, anteriorly nearly in contact with base 

 of rhinotheca, a membranous or cartilaginous piece showing within the 

 basal portion ; cere straight, slightly ascending basally, and, together with 

 greater part of loral and orbital regions and sides of gular region, nude. 

 Wing rather large, very broad and rounded, the longer primaries with 

 tips extending decidedly beyond those of longest secondaries (except in 

 O. wagleri) ; fourth to sixth primaries longest, the first (outermost) 

 about one-half (in 0. v. leucogastra) to nearly three-fifths (in 0. wagleri) 

 as long as the longest and strongly bowed or incurved. Tail longer than 

 wing (very slightly as in 0. v. leucogastra) , strongly rounded, the rec- 

 trices (12) relatively broad to very broad, with rounded tips. Tarsus 

 relatively long and stout, less than one-third as long as wing, the acro- 

 tarsium with a single series of large transverse scutella, the planta tarsi 

 with a series of smaller transverse scutella along each side (these less 

 distinct, especially on inner side, in 0. v. leucogastra) ; middle toe nearly

to quite three-fourths as long as tarsus, the lateral toes reaching about 

 to penultimate articulation of middle toe, the outer usually a little longer 

 than the inner; hallux about as long as combined length of first two 

 phalanges of outer toe ; claws moderately large to rather small, moderately 

 curved (that of hallux more strongly curved) compressed. 



Figure 3.—0rtalis vetula. 



Plumage and coloration. — Frontal feathers erect or suberect, more or 

 less elongated (very much so in 0. wagleri), rigid and lanceolate or sub- 

 lanceolate, those of crown and occiput more or less elongated (very much 

 so in 0. wagleri; very slightly so in 0. v. leucogastra) but broader and 

 with rounded tips; feathers of neck variable, in 0. wagleri rather long 

 and blended on hindneck, rigid and acuminate-lanceolate on foreneck, 

 malar region, and median line of throat, on 0. v. leucogastra short and 

 rounded, even on foreneck ; plumage in general soft, the feathers distinctly 

 outlined, with broadly rounded tips (more blended on underparts) that 

 of anal region soft and downy ; loral and orbital regions mostly nude, the 

 sides of chin and throat also nude, separated by a narrow strip of feathers, 

 these small and bristlelike in 0. v. leucogastra, much broader and lanceo- 

 late in 0. wagleri. Coloration plain brownish above, paler beneath, the 

 abdomen, thighs, and under tail coverts sometimes whitish, sometimes 

 deep cinnamon-rufous or chestnut; rectrices usually tipped with pale 

 brown, whitish or chestnut, sometimes mostly chestnut, and outer pri- 

 maries sometimes chestnut. 



Range. — Southern Texas (Rio Grande Valley) to Paraguay, Argentina, 

 and Peru. (About 13 species and 30 subspecies.)

-^ According to Bent, U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull. 162, 1932, 350, the upper wing coverts 

 are barred with cinnamon-buff in this plumage. This appears to be a variable 

 character, as I have not found it in all the juvenal birds examined in the present 

 connection.

on the outer edge with cinnamon-buff; rectrices as in adult but all tipped 

 with ashy buffy brown and pointed in shape ; auriculars, sides and lower 

 parts of the neck, and the breast dark isabelline buffy brown ; rest of under- 

 parts as in adult but more washed with cinnamon-buff. 



Downy young. — Forehead, crown, cheeks, and auriculars pale pinkish 

 buff barred narrowly with dull sepia, the light interspaces much wider 

 than the bars, the crown, cheeks, and auriculars tinged with light buffy 

 cinnamon, and the coronal bars more or less confluent along the median 

 line forming a dark irregular spot ; occiput and hindneck fuscous washed 

 with sepia, the sides of neck and posterior part of hindneck cinnamon- 

 buff irregularly and incompletely barred with fuscous to dark sepia ; back, 

 wings, rump, and upper tail coverts sepia mottled, chiefly transversely, 

 with cinnamon-buff, the wings sepia edged with tawny cinnamon-buff; 

 chin and middle upper throat and all of abdomen, sides, and flanks white ; 

 the breast forming a broad band of cinnamon-buff between these white 

 areas; thighs and vent washed with pale cinnamon-buff transversely 

 narrowly mottled with sepia. 



In some specimens the pinkish buff of the top and sides of the head is 

 replaced by pallid neutral gray, and all the brownish parts are slightly 

 washed with ashy. 



Adult male.— Wing 197-219 (208.2) ; tail 222-255 (239) ; exposed

 pressed, its width at base of culmen equal to or greater than its depth 

 at same point; culmen broadly rounded (not ridged) ; nostril relatively 

 rather large, longitudinal, elliptical or fusiform, anteriorly nearly in con- 

 tact with the rhinotheca, a cartilaginous lobe or tubercle distinctly visible 

 within the posterior half (more or less). Entire loral and orbital regions, 

 sides of forehead, and anterior half of malar region nude, but with scant, 

 minute bristles, at least on malar region and sides of frontal region, but

Adult (sexes alike). — Entire feathered areas of head, neck, upper- 

 parts, wings, and tail black with a strong, dark greenish blue sheen, the 

 primaries with little if any sheen, and washed with fuscous ; upper breast, 

 thighs, and flanks like the upperparts but less glossy, mixed with grayish ; 

 lower breast, abdomen, and under tail coverts chaetura drab to fuscous 

 washed to a varying degree with dark grayish olive to olivaceous-black,

Immature. — No specimen or description seen, but Carriker (Ann. 

 Carnegie Mus., iv, 1908, 385) writes that several young birds taken on 

 Volcan Turrialba, Costa Rica, and not saved, had the feathers of the lower 

 parts edged with rufous, which "even persists after the upperparts have 

 assumed the adult plumage." Apparently no one has published anything 

 on any but the adult plumage.

Galliform birds with nasal fossae completely and densely feathered ; at 

 least upper half of tarsus (usually whole tarsus) feathered, and toes with 

 lateral pectinations or else densely feathered; neck usually with lateral 




64 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



inflatable air sacs ; postacetabular region of pelvis very broad ; hypocleid- 

 eum triangular; tarsometatarsus less than half as long as tibia. 



Bill relatively small, the culmen rounded (not ridged), the tomia 

 smooth; cere completely and densely feathered. Wing moderate, very 

 concave beneath, the longest primaries much longer than longest seconda- 

 ries; third or fourth primaries longest (fifth and third sometimes equal), 

 the first (outermost) intermediate between sixth and seventh, seventh and 

 eighth, or equal to eighth; primaries rigid, the outer ones much bowed 

 or incurved distally. Tail variable in form, usually decidedly shorter 

 than wing, the rectrices 16-20. Tarsus shorter than middle toe with claw 

 (except in Centrocercus), with at least the upper half densely feathered 

 (wholly feathered except in Bonasa and Tetrastes, the toes also feathered 

 in winter specimens of Lagopus), never spurred; middle toe, without 

 claw, shorter than tarsus ; lateral toes about equal, reaching to or slightly 

 beyond penultimate articulation of middle toe; hallux shorter (sometimes 

 much shorter) than basal phalanx of middle toe; claws relatively small, 

 slightly curved, rather blunt; toes usually with more or less distinct 

 lateral horny pectinations or comblike or fringelike processes (deciduous, 

 however, in summer) ; anterior toes connected at base by a web between 

 first phalanges. Head completely feathered except, sometimes, a naked 

 superciliary space. 



Of the characters that distinguish the Tetraonidae from other Galli- 

 formes some are variable in their development in different genera. The 

 naked superciliary space, for example, is inconspicuous in the campestrian 

 genera Tympanuchus, Pedioecetes, and Centrocercus but is conspicuously 

 developed in Lagopus, Dendragapus, and Canachites, especially the first, 

 and is brightly colored (red, orange, or yellow) during the breeding 

 season. Many genera possess, in the male, an inflatable air sac on the 

 side of the neck, this reaching its greatest development in Tympanuchus, 

 in which the sac when inflated is of nearly the size and color of a small 

 orange. The males of some genera also possess an ornamental erectile 

 tuft of feathers on each side of the neck, Tympanuchus having elongated, 

 rigid, narrow feathers inserted immediately above the air sacs, while 

 Bonasa has, in nearly the same position (the air sacs, however, being 

 absent) very broad, soft, nearly truncated feathers. The tail is extremely 

 variable in form and development. It is short and rounded in Lagopus 

 and Tympanuchus ; much longer and more or less fan-shaped in Bonasa, 

 Dendragapus, and Canachites; very short and graduated, with the middle 

 rectrices projecting considerably beyond the others, in Pedioecetes; and 

 considerably elongated, excessively graduated, with narrowly acuminate 

 rectrices in Cenfrocercus; while in the Palearctic genus Tetrao the tail 

 is forked, with the lateral rectrices curved or curled outward in the males. 

 The feathering of the tarsus extends nearly, if not quite, to the base of 

 the toes, except in Bonasa and Tetrastes, in which only about the upper 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 65 



half is feathered. The extent and development of this feathering vary- 

 greatly with the season, being denser and longer in winter, when, in 

 Lagopus, the toes themselves are densely clothed with long feathers, while 

 iu the northern forms of Pedioecetes the feathers on the lower portion 

 of the tarsus are so long as to almost conceal the toes. The "purpose" 

 of this dense feathering of the feet seems to be to enable the birds to 

 walk more easily upon soft snow, the fringelike processes along the sides 

 of the toes in some genera possibly serving the same purpose, for in 

 summer, when there is no need of "snowshoes," the toes of Lagopus be- 

 come quite nude. At the same time the claws, which during winter are 

 large, broad, and concave beneath, like inverted spoons, are also shed.^* 

 The geographic range of the Tetraonidae embraces practically the en- 

 tire North Temperate Zone. North America possesses six peculiar 

 genera {Bonasa, Canachites, Dendragapus, Tympanuchus, Pedioecetes, 

 and Cc^ntrocercus), while the Palearctic Region has only four genera 

 {Tetrao, Urogallus, Falcipennis, and Tetrastes). One genus {Lagopus) 

 is circumpolar. Two of the Old World species {Tetrao lyrurus and 

 Urogallus urogallus) have been introduced into North America but seem 

 not to have become established.

 sized inflatable air sac present in males. Adult males with upperparts 

 grayish or dusky, more or less vermiculated, the tail plain dusky with

 grayish, variegated on sides and, especially, flanks with white; adult 

 females more barred and more brownish in general coloration. 



Range. — Coniferous forests of western North America, from high 

 mountains of California and Arizona to upper Yukon and Mackenzie 

 River Valleys. (One species.)''^ 



" There is wide diversity of opinion as to whether the forms of this genus are 

 all conspecific or are more properly to be treated as two species, one containing 

 the forms fuliginosus, sierrae, howardi, and sitkensis, and the second, obscurus and 

 richardsonii. The birds when studied in the museum certainly give a picture of 

 conspecificity throughout, but against this must be weighed the fact that the 

 people most conversant with these birds in life are convinced of the reality of two 

 speciiic groups. The characters by which they separate the two are as follows: 

 (1) The downy young are yellow below in the fuliginosus group, white in the 

 ohsciirus group; (2) the hooting sacs of the male in the breeding season are thick, 

 large, tuberculate, and deep yellow in color in fuliginosus; not thick or tuberculate 

 and are purplish in obscunis; (3) the hooting noise of the courting male is uttered 

 from the ground and is audible for less than a hundred yards in ohscurus, while 

 in f'tiliginosus it is given from high up in trees and carries audibly for several 

 miles; (4) in fuliginosus the tail of the adult male is rounded, the feathers also 

 rounded at the tip; while in ohscurus the tail of the adult male is nearly square, 

 the feathers terminally truncate.

DENDRAGAPUS OBSCURUS FULIGINOSUS (Ridgway) 



Sooty Grouse 



Adult 'male. — Not distinguishable from that of Dendragapus obscurus 

 sitkensis. 



Adult female. — Similar to that of Dendragapus obscurus sitkensis but 

 less reddish in general coloration, the upperparts being duller brown with 

 a great deal of black showing through and with the brownish areas every- 

 where speckled with blackish or grayish. This grayish color is predomi- 

 nant on the hindneck, upper tail coverts, rectrices, breast, and sides, and 

 to a lesser extent the flanks. The brown on the forehead varies from 

 Saccardo's umber to sepia (tawny to amber brown in sitkensis) , and the 

 brownish bars and markings on the occiput, interscapulars, and back, 

 besides being much more reduced than in sitkensis, are paler — avellaneous 

 to light pinkish cinnamon; in the tail feathers only the central pair has 

 any appreciable cinnamon-buff mottling, the other rectrices having their 

 mottlings grayish to light drab ; the feathers of the flanks, lower abdomen, 

 and under tail coverts have the white tips smaller than in sitkensis, and 

 have the upper and central abdomen slightly darker and very slightly 

 more brownish than in sitkensis. 



Immature male. — Similar to the adult but with the rectrices narrower 

 and more pointed terminally and with the body plumage often retaining 

 some of the juvenal tertials and some of the coronal and occipital feathers. 

 Practically indistinguishable from the corresponding stage of Dendraga- 

 pus obscurus sitkensis, except by such juvenal feathers as may be present. 



Immature female. — Similar to the adult female but differing from it 

 in the narrower rectrices and the retention (in some cases) of juvenal 

 tertials and head feathers. 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Similar to the corresponding plumage of 

 Dendragapus obscurus sitkensis but less rufescent generally (sepia to 

 Saccardo's umber) ; similar to the adult female of the present subspecies 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 75 



but with the feathers of the interscapulars, scapulars, upper back, lower 

 throat, breast, upper abdomen, and sides with white shaft streaks; chin 

 and upper throat more whitish, less heavily marked with brown and the 

 brown feather tips paler; breast and abdomen paler — ^buffy whitish to 

 pale tawny white, the breast, sides of abdomen, and flanks spotted with 

 dusky and pale buff; rectrices narrower and more pointed, mottled like 

 the feathers of the back and with no gray terminal band ; remiges barred, 

 and with no gray terminal band ; remiges barred, mottled, or flecked with 

 pale grayish buff on the outer webs.''^ 



Dozvny young (sexes presumably alike).- — Forehead, cheeks, chin, 

 throat, and the underpart of body vary from ivory yellow to straw 

 yellow, the crown mottled with fuscous-black and strongly washed with 

 pale ochraceous-tawny ; auriculars sparsely blotched with fuscous-black; 

 the back is pale ochraceous-tawny mottled with fuscous and ochraceous- 

 buff; iris brown; bill flesh color with duskier culmen; feet yellow with 

 dusky claws. 



Adult male.— Wing 214-238 (221.1); tail 131-171 (149.1); exposed 

 culmen 18.1-21.3 (19.1); tarsus 42.6-46.3 (44.1); middle toe without 

 claw 40.8-45.4 (43.2 mm.).^^ 



Adult female.— Wing 188-226 (204.4) ; tail 111-140 (127.4) ; ex- 

 posed culmen 16.4-21.8 (19.4) ; tarsus 38.7-42.7 (40.2) ; middle toe with- 

 out claw 36.2-42 (38.9 mm.).'''^ 



Range. — Resident in the coastal mountains of the North American 

 mainland from the border between southwestern Yukon, Canada, and 

 Alaska (Skagway; White Pass), south through southeastern Alaska, 

 through coastal British Columbia and Vancouver Island (Alta Lake 

 Region; Beecher Bay, Chilliwak, Coldstream, Klippan River Valley, 

 Lund), western Washington (Fort Steilacoom, Puget Sount, Mount 

 Rainier, Mount Stewart, Tacoma, Hannegan Pass, Cat Creek, Beaver 



""'The Juvenal remiges are molted during July and August; the molt begins as 

 soon as the last of these feathers are fully grown, or even before that ; and the body 

 molt into the first winter plumage (:= immature plumage in this book) is continuous 

 from August to October. The postjuvenal molt is complete, except that the outer 

 pairs of primaries are retained for a full j'ear" (ex Bent, U. S. Nat. }i[us. Bull. 162, 

 1932, 108). This accounts for the paucity of true juvenal specimens in collections, 

 as this plumage is begun to be shed before it is hardly complete. 



Van Rossem has demonstrated that the juvenal rectrices are shed at a very early 

 age beginning with the outermost pair and progressing medially. These feathers are 

 shed when the chicks are scarcely more than two or three weeks old, and then the 

 slow-growing immature tail feathers begin to appear beyond the tips of the coverts. 

 The immature tail is more rounded (owing to the lesser relative length of the lateral 

 rectrices) than the adult tail. Most of these rectrices are replaced during the follow- 

 ing winter, spring, and summer in a gradual molt, but often the outermost pair are 

 retained until the following autumn.

DENDRAGAPUS OBSCURUS HOWARDI Dickey and Van Rossem 



Mount Pings Dusky Grouse 



Adult male. — Very similar to that of Dendragapus ohscurus sierrae but 

 with the vermiculations on the feathers of the upperparts heavier and 

 more conspicuous, the ground color of these feathers very slightly paler, 

 more grayish, than in sierrae; tail decidedly longer and much more gradu- 

 ated, with the gray terminal band averaging broader. 



Adult feifiale. — Similar to that of D. o. sierrae but with the tail longer 

 and more graduated and with the gray terminal band averaging broader. 



Immature. — None seen, but undoubtedly the immature birds of either 

 sex differ from their respective adult plumages in having narrower rec- 

 trices and usually some juvenal feathers on the head and inner part of 

 the wing. 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Very close to that of sierrae from which it 

 cannot be separated with certainty but apparently averaging slightly more 

 sandy in general color above. 



Downy young (sexes alike). — Like that of D. o. sierrae but slightly 

 paler, sandier above and on the wings.®^

RiCH.\RD<ON's Grouse 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Dciidragapus obsciirus sitkciisis but 

 lacking the gray temiinal band on the tail feathers (or, at nio.^t, with 

 this band so dark as to be hardly distinct from the rest of the feathers), 

 the rectrices more truncate terminally, the tail outline squarer, and with 

 more w-hitish on the chin and throat; the cervical air sacs, or hooting 

 sacs, are smaller and deep purplish, instead of yellow as in the coastal 

 forms, and its skin is not thickened and carunculated in the present form ; 

 iris bister ; "comb" deep yellow ; eyelid dull greenish yellow ; bill blackish ; 

 feet brownish gi"ay. 



Adult fci::alc. — Similar to that of D. o. sirrrae but much darker above, 

 the broad dark bars and bands being dark fuscous to fuscous-black (as 

 against dark sepia to clove brown in sirrrae), with no gray terminal 

 band on the tail, and the breast and abdomen slightly duskier ; iris hazel 

 brown; "comb" deep dull yellow; bill grayish black; the lower mandible 

 yellowish flesh color basally ; feet horn gray, claws brown.

 less squarish, more graduated; and with occasional juvenal fcatiiers on 

 the head and nape and inner edge of wing. 



Imuialurc female. — Differs from its adult in the same way that the 

 immature male does from its corresponding adult state. 



Jnvcna! (sexes alike). — Similar to that of D. o. sierrae but much darker, 

 less tawny ; the general dorsal coloration Saccardo's umber to ciniiamon- 

 b^o^vn (instead of ochraceous-tawny as in sierrae) and the dusky vcrmicu- 

 lations and black bars more conspicuous. 



Doiciiy yoiDici. — Similar to that of D. o. sierrae, but with the forehead, 

 superciliaries, and breast and abdoinen whitish instead of huffy ; chin and 

 upper throat wa.shed with pale huffy.

Grant, Tetrao mutus Montin [Keron }iIontin, Physiogr. Salsk. Handl., i, 1776, 



155, is not a systematic but a vernacular name.] ) 



Medium-sized to small Tetraonidae (length about 305-430 mm.) with 

 toes, as well as tarsi, densely feathered in winter (more sparsely in sum- 

 mer) ; tail more than half but less than three-fifths as long as wing, very 

 slightly rounded or nearly truncate, the rectrices (16) moderately broad, 

 rounded at tips ; neck without air sacs or elongated feathers ; all the 

 American and most of the Palearctic species white in winter, the remiges 

 white in summer. 



Bill varying from stout to rather slender but always much shorter (from 

 frontal antiae) than distance from base to anterior angle of eye, its depth 

 at frontal antiae sometimes slightly less, sometimes much greater than 

 its width at same point; culmen rounded or very indistinctly ridged; 

 maxillary tomium more or less strongly concave or arched, slightly in- 

 flected ; rhamphotheca smooth. Wing moderate, strongly concave beneath, 

 the longest primaries exceeding longest secondaries by between one- 

 fourth and one-third the length of wing; third and fourth primaries 

 longest, the first (outermost) equal to seventh or intermediate between 

 sixth and seventh; outer primaries only moderately bowed or incurved, 

 four or five outer ones with inner webs distinctly sinuated. Tail be- 

 tween one-half and three-fifths as long as wing, very slightly rounded

to nearly truncate, the rectrices (16) not wider distally than tips, more 

 or less rounded. Tarsus slightly less than one-sixth to a little more than 

 one-fifth as long as wing, completely and densely clothed with long, hair- 

 like feathers, in winter plumage, with much shorter feathers, the planta 

 tarsi nude, in summer ; middle toe decidedly shorter than tarsus, com- 

 pletely feathered (the feathering even sometimes concealing claws) in 

 winter, in summer nude except basally, their upper surface without 

 distinct transverse scutella except on terminal phalanx, being elsewhere 

 covered with small, rounded, rather indistinct scales ; claws relatively 

 broad, very concave beneath, long in winter, much shorter in summer. 



Figure 8. — Lagopus lagopus. 



Plumage and coloration. — A more or less extensive nude superciliary 

 space, brightly colored (red) and fringed in summer; neck with neither 

 air sacs nor elongated feathers; plumage in general rather soft (except 

 remiges and rectrices), the feathers relatively broad, rounded, and dis- 

 tinctly outlined, except on lower abdomen, anal region, and legs, where 

 soft, hairlike, and blended. In winter plumage entirely white except tail 

 (in part) and, sometimes, a black stripe on side of head — the tail also 

 entirely white in one species.^* In summer the plumage, more or less 

 extensively mottled or barred or spotted with black, brown, dusky, gray, 

 or ochraceous ; the remiges, however, always remaining white (except 

 in L. scoticus). 



" In L. scoticus the plumage is entirely blackish and brown or rarely mottled, 

 even in winter, even the primaries being wholly dusky.

 black, and for the shafts of the primaries, which are dusky except at the 




98 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



tip; the crown feathers are blackish in their concealed basal portions; 

 feathers of toes longer and denser than in summer. 



Adult female, summer plumage. — Forehead, crown, occiput, nape, inter 

 scapulars, scapulars, inner upper wing coverts, back, rump, and upper 

 tail coverts ochraceous-tawny to tawny-olive, each feather barred (and 

 in the case of the interscapulars, scapulars, and upper back often broadly 

 blotched) with fuscous-black, and tipped with pale tawny to pale olive- 

 buff, and occasionally to almost white; rest of upper wing coverts and 

 the remiges v/hite, the primaries with dusky brown shafts, which are 

 white terminally ; rectrices dark fuscous tipped with white ; lores and 

 sides of head cinnamon-buff to light ochraceous-buff, the feathers with 

 small fuscous transverse spots; chin and upper throat similar but often 

 with no or almost no dusky markings; lower throat, breast, upper ab- 

 domen, sides, flanks, and under tail coverts ochraceous-buff to light 

 ochraceous-tawny heavily barred with wavy bands of clove brown to 

 fuscous ; middle of abdomen to vent, and thighs slightly paler and without 

 dark bands ; under wing coverts white ; "comb" pale vermilion ; bill dull 

 blackish, dull flesh color below at extreme base of lower mandible; claws 

 dark brown, whitish on terminal third. 



Adult female, autumn plumage. — Similar to that of the male but slightly 

 more grayish on the back, rump, and upper tail coverts, the tips of the 

 feathers being more ashy and the other brownish bars slightly less ru- 

 f escent ; the throat and breast paler — bright tawny, and the extent of 

 this color on the sides much reduced compared with the male ; the white 

 of the abdomen correspondingly more extensive. In this plumage there 

 usually is a sprinkling of feathers left over from the summer plumage, 

 especially on the lower breast and sides. 



Adult female, winter plumage. — Like the corresponding plumage of the 

 male, but the bases of the feathers of the crown are more grayish. 



First winter plumage (sexes alike). — Indistinguishable from the adult 

 female winter plumage. (Females are therefore not separable, but first- 

 winter males have the bases of the crown feathers more grayish, less 

 blackish than in adults.) 



First autumn plumage (sexes alike). — Similar to the summer plumage 

 of the adult female but with the brownish bars, edges, and tips of the 

 feathers of the upperparts paler and yellower — cinnamon-buff to honey 

 yellow, the dark marks on the throat and breast and upper abdomen 

 smaller, usually some of the rectrices retained from the juvenal plumage 

 — narrow, pointed, tipped with white, otherwise fuscous-black barred and 

 edged with cinnamon-buff to honey yellow, and with the outermost two 

 remiges also retained from the juvenal plumage; lower abdomen and 

 thighs grayish white. 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Similar to the first autumn plumage but with 

 all but the outermost two remiges chaetura drab to clove brown, bordered

narrowly and barred incompletely on the outer web with pale pinkish 

 buff; all the upper wing coverts like the back; the general tone of the 

 dorsal feather bars and edges richer, more orange — raw sienna to antique 

 brown, and the abdomen more buffy ; thighs buffy also. 



Downy young (sexes alike). — Forehead, sides of crown and occiput, 

 sides of head chamois to cream bufif; with a black loreal spot and a 

 median frontal line, and a postauricular wavy line of chaetura black ; the 

 median frontal line bifurcating to enclose most of the crown and occiput 

 which are deep auburn to deep chestnut bordered by blackish, the lateral 

 borders uniting again posteriorly to form a broad but much interrupted 

 spinal stripe, which bifurcates on the lower back and the branches of 

 which meet again at the base of the tail; wings and middle of back 

 cinnamon-buff to clay color; sides of back (lateral to the blackish lines) 

 and underparts straw yellow, washed on the breast with pale orange- 

 yellow.

 rest of forehead and the short supraorbital marks white; crown, occiput, 

 nape, and upper interscapulars fuscous-black finely barred with tawny- 

 olive to Saccardo's umber; rest of interscapulars deep chaetura black 

 narrowly tipped with tawny-olive; the back, rump, upper tail coverts, 

 inner secondaries, and some of the inner lesser and median upper wing 

 coverts fuscous-black faintly vermiculated with tawny-olive to Saccardo's 

 umber; some of these dorsal feathers darker — deep chaetura drab — and 

 without any tawny ; outer upper wing coverts and some of the inner ones 

 as well, the primaries and all but the innermost secondaries pure white, 

 the primaries (except the outermost one) with dusky shafts; rectrices 

 plain fuscous-black to chaetura black; loreal band blackish; auriculars 

 and cheeks fuscous-black, the feathers tipped with white and faintly banded 

 with tawny-olive ; chin, throat, and lower sides of head white ; upper breast 

 deep chaetura black narrowly tipped with white; sides similar but with 

 some white feathers mixed in lower breast, abdomen, flanks, thighs, under 

 tail coverts, under wing coverts, and feathering of feet white; bill and 

 claws black; comb bright scarlet. 



Adult female, summer. — Feathers covering nostrils white with a faint 

 buffy wash; forehead, crown, occiput, nape, scapulars, interscapulars, 

 back, rump, upper tail coverts, inner secondaries, and some of the inner 

 upper wing coverts deep chaettira "black, each feather with wavy bars of 

 ochraceous-buff, and tipped with white or buffy white ; rest of upper wing 

 coverts, primaries, outer secondaries, and under wing coverts white, the 

 primaries, except the outermost one with pale brownish shafts ; sides of 

 head, chin, and throat pale ochraceous-buff, each feather with a fuscous- 

 black to blackish median streak, these streaks widening terminally in 

 the feathers of the lower throat ; feathers of breast, sides, flanks, and under 

 tail coverts, chaetura black broadly tipped and banded with ochraceous- 

 buff; abdomen similar but with a great many white feathers mixed in; 

 thighs and feathering of feet white ; bill and claws black. 




110 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



Adult male, winter. — Pure white except for black tail and loreal stripe.^' 



Other plumages. — Unknown. It may however, be assumed that the 

 female also has a white winter plumage, because summer birds have an 

 irregular sprinkling of white feathers on the wings and underparts. In- 

 complete and inconclusive evidence also seems to indicate that the male 

 in autumn is more vermiculated with tawny-olive above than in the sum- 

 mer plumage. This is in keeping with the known tendency of the plumage 

 sequence in this group. Similarly, an undated, unsexed specimen exam- 

 ined appears to be a female in autumn plumage. It differs from the 

 summer female in having the ochraceous marks on the scapulars, back, 

 rump, upper tail coverts, breast, and sides narrower and darker — 

 ochraceous-tawiiy instead of ochraceous-buff. However, at present it 

 cannot be proved that this is an autumn bird rather than an aberrant 

 summer specimen, although it has a scattering of new white feathers in 

 the colored areas suggesting the start of the molt into the winter plumage.

LAGOPUS MUTUS TOWNSENDI Elliot 



Townsend's Ptarmigan 



Adult male, summer plumage. — Forehead buffy white speckled and 

 mottled with fuscous-black; crown, occiput, nape, scapulars, and inter- 

 scapulars between cinnamon-buff and clay color, each feather heavily 

 barred with wavy marks of black and narrowly tipped with whitish; the 

 feathers of the crown with the subterminal black area so wide it almost 

 hides the clay-colored parts; back, rump, upper tail coverts, inner sec- 

 ondaries, and inner upper wing coverts tawny-olive (brightest on the 

 rump) finely banded (sometimes some of the feathers blotched) and 

 vermiculated with black and narrowly tipped with white, many of the 

 feathers of the back with a light grayish-olive tone instead of the more 

 frequent tawny-olive, giving a somewhat ashy sprinkling to the upper- 

 parts; outer upper wing coverts, all the primaries, and all but the inner 

 secondaries pure white, the primaries with dusky shafts ; rectrices dark 

 clove brown, narrowly white basally and narrowly tipped with buffy white ; 

 lores blackish spotted with white (the tips of the feathers being white) ; 

 auricles and upper cheeks cinnamon-buff to clay color narrowly banded 

 with black and tipped with white; chin and upper throat white; lower 

 throat cinnamon-buff to clay color banded with black, the buffy inter- 

 spaces wider than the black marks ; breast tawny-olive more narrowly 

 banded with black, the bands and the interspaces nearly equal in width ; 

 sides and flanks similar but with the dark marks finer becoming mere 

 vermiculations ; abdomen, thighs, feathering of tarsi and toes, and under 

 wing coverts white; under tail coverts tawny-olive barred with black; 

 bill and claws black; comb scarlet.

 buff somewhat speckled with black ; crown, occiput, nape, scapulars, inter- 

 scapulars, back, rump, upper tail coverts, and all but the outer upper 

 wing coverts bright ochraceous-buff barred with black and the feathers 

 narrowly tipped with white or buffy white, the black marks being very 

 broad on the interscapulars and back and on the crown, much narrower 

 on the occiput, nape, upper wing and tail coverts, and rump ; the nape 

 is often somewhat tinged with pale ashy gray; outermost upper wing 

 coverts, primaries, and all but the innermost secondaries white, the pri- 

 maries with dusky shafts ; rectrices clove brown narrowly tipped with 

 whitish, and vermiculated with tawny-olive on the basal two-thirds or so

 black markings deeper and broader especially on the rump and upper 

 tail coverts and also the upper wing coverts ; below quite different from 

 the summer plumage; chin, throat, and sides of head and of neck ochra- 

 ceous-buff, the feathers crossed by narrow bars of fuscous, the dark bars 

 much narrower than the buffy interspaces; lower throat, breast, upper

LAGOPUS MUTUS ATKHENSIS Turner 



Turner's Ptarmigan 



Adult male, summer plumage. — There seem to be two fairly distinct 

 color phases of this plumage in this race, as follows : 



1. Reddish phase: Similar to the summer male of L. m. sanfordi but 

 the brownish areas with less of the ashy tinge and with the general ground 

 color darker brown, the lower back and rump pale ochraceous tawny 

 olive; differs from L. m. townsendi in having more ashy and in being 

 somewhat paler and more tawny. 



2. Olive-brown phase: Similar to the reddish phase but with the 

 ground color Saccardo's umber to pale olive-brown extensively tinged 

 with ashy. 



Adult female, summer plumage. — Like that of L. m. toimisendi. This 

 is perhaps the most variable plumage of any of the island races of this 

 species. Probably some of the differences, especially in the longer upper 

 tail coverts, may eventually be found to be a matter of age; but in our 

 present state of knowledge, this is mere conjecture. 



Autumn adults. — Not yet known. 



Adult male, winter plumage. — All white except for the black loreal 

 stripe which continues behind the eye for a short distance, and for the 

 dark clove brown rectrices narrowly tipped with white. 



Adult fenmle, winter plumage. — Like that of the male but without the 

 black loreal stripe. 



Juvenal.- — Unknown. 



Downy young, male. — Marguerite yellow, slightly washed with pale 

 ochraceous on the breast and abdomen, and marked above with blackish 

 and russet as follows : Narrow median line of black runs from the base 

 of the culmen to the crown where it divides to encircle a large russet 

 coronal patch, and meets again in a broader dorsal band on the nape and 

 upper back ; it divides on the lower back to form two parallel bands which 

 come almost together at the tail end, enclosing a spinal tract of Marguerite 

 yellow much suffused with pale russet; in addition to these marks there 

 is a blackish femoral band on each side, as well as two wavy ones on each 

 wing and a very narrow line from the bill through the eyes to the hind 

 end of the auriculars. 



Adult male.— Wing 185-197 (191.2) ; tail 98-112 (109.6) ; bill from 

 anterior end of nostril to tip 9.7-11.3 (9.3) ; width of bill at gape 12-13.1

LAGOPUS MUTUS DIXONI J. Grinnell 



Dixon's Ptarmigan 



Adult male, summer plumage. — Like that of L. m. nelsoni but with the 

 brownish markings less ochraceous-tawny, duller and much reduced in 

 size and number, making the bird much darker, approaching in this char- 

 acter L. m. evermanni, but with more tawny to hazel vermiculations on 

 the breast and back. Above, general color of all but the white areas, 

 sooty bister ; whole crown and occiput sooty, minutely and rather sparsely 

 barred with tawny-oHve to hazel; breast barred with tawny, the bars 

 becoming narrower posteriorly and practically disappearing on the lower 

 breast. 



Adult female, summer plurnage. — Like the corresponding plumage of 

 L. m. evermanni. 



Adidt male, autumn plumage. — Like the male in summer plumage but 

 paler, more grayish above — dark hair brown with a grayish "bloom," the 

 blackish areas greatly reduced. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 121 



Adidt female, autumn plumage. — Like the autumn male with the black 

 bars and vermiculations more pronounced and without the grayish 

 "bloom." 



Female, first autumn plumage. — Like the adult female in autumn, but 

 outer primaries more pointed and the pale bars decidedly more ochraceous- 

 tawny and broader, above and on the breast.^* 



Juvenal (unsexed). — Like the females in first autumn plumage but 

 with the remiges dull hair brown externally mottled with bufify; entire 

 underparts barred like the breast, the dark bars somewhat paler on the 

 abdomen. 



Downy young. — Apparently unknown. 



Adult male.— Wing 172-195 (181.7) ; tail 101-120 (107.8) ; bill from 

 anterior end of nostril to tip 9-10.2 (9.6) ; width of bill at gape 11.2-12 

 (11.6) ; height of bill at angle of gonys 6.8-7.4 (7.2 mm.).^" 



Adult female.— Wing 163-179 (172); tail 91-107 (97.7); bill from 

 anterior end of nostril to tip 8.8-9.8 (9.3) ; width of bill at gape 10.7-11.8 

 (11.2) ; height of bill at angle of gonys 6.3-7.2 (6.9 mm.).='i 



Range. — Resident in the islands and coastal mainland of the Glacier 

 Bay region of Alaska, south to Baranof Island, and inland for an un- 

 determined distance, intergrading with L. w. rupestris in central northern 

 British Columbia (Ingenika, Chapa-atan, and Sheslay Rivers). 



In winter the birds wander southward from the northern parts of the 

 range but do not seem to go south beyond the limits of the breeding 

 range. It is possible that in winter some of the birds in the northern 

 mainland part of the range of this race actually belong to the forms 

 nelsoni or rupestris, but there is no way to tell them apart in winter 

 plumage, other than size (which is only an average character). 



Type locality. — Near Port Frederick, 2,700 feet, Chichagof Island, 

 Alaska.

LAGOPUS MUTUS EUPESTRIS (GmeUn) 



Rock Ptarmigan 



Adult male, summer plumage. — Like that of L. m. dixoni, ,but paler 

 and grayer, the brown markings hair brown to dull grayish olive-brown. 



Adult female, summer plumage. — Similar to that of L. m. dixoni but 

 upperparts more grayish, the general appearance being more grayish 

 than brownish and with the black blotches much larger. In worn plumage 

 some of these birds are almost black above. Breast, sides, and upper 

 abdomen whitish or only very pale ochraceous-buff barred with heavy 

 black bars. Occasional specimens are found, especially in the far north- 

 ern part of the range, that are not to be distinguished from L. m. nelsoni, 

 having more of the brownish color, but most of these brown specimens 

 are first-year birds. 



Adult male, autumn plumage. — Similar to the summer male but slightly 

 browner, the vermiculations averaging finer, giving an appearance of 

 greater uniformity to the upperparts and breast. 



Adult female, autumn plumage. — More hair brown, less marked with 

 black than summer females; many of the dorsal feathers only vermicu- 

 lated with blackish. Apparently this plumage is never (?) fully present, 

 as by the time many of the black summer feathers have been replaced 

 by the vermiculated hair brown ones, the white feathers of the winter 

 plumage begin to appear as well. 



Adult male, winter plumage. — Entirely white except for the blackish 

 loreal stripe extending through and behind the eye, and the rectrices, 

 which are dark clove brown; feathering of tarsi and toes longer and 

 denser than in summer plumage. 



Adult female, winter plumage. — Similar to the winter male but without 

 the black loreal stripe. 



Female, first autumn plumage. — Browner and more narrowly barred 

 with blackish above and on the breast than the adult female in autumn ; 

 outer primaries more pointed and often with one or more of the juvenal 

 remiges retained. 



Juvenal (unsexed). — Differs from the female in first autumn plumage 

 in having the upperparts with bright ochraceous edges and bars on the 

 otherwise blackish feathers; breast, sides, and flanks ochraceous-buff, 

 brightest on the breast, barred with fuscous; remiges dark hair brown 

 to grayish clove brown externally mottled with pale bufify. 




BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 123 



Downy young (unsexed). — Similar to that of L. m. atkhensis but back 

 and rump generally russet with the black bifurcated spinal stripe wanting 

 or reduced to dark brownish, disconnected markings, and the yellowish 

 areas slightly darker and more ochraceous. 



Adiilt male.— Wing 183-200 (191.5) ; tail 102-115 (109.5) ; bill from 

 anterior end of nostril to tip 8.7-10 (9.4; width of bill at gape 10.&-11.9 

 (11.3) ; height of bill at angle of gonys 7.1-7.9 (7.6 mm.).^^ 



Adult female.— Wing 175-198 (182.9) ; tail 90-115 (100.4) ; bill from 

 anterior end of nostril to tip 6-10.4 (8.4) ; width of bill at gape 10.5-12.8 

 (11.5) ; height of bill at angle of gonys 6.3-9.6 (7.3 mm.).^* 



Range. — Breeds in northern North America from east-central Alaska 

 and central Northwest Territories (where it intergrades with L. m. 

 nelsoni) eastward, including Melville, Victoria, Ellesmere and Baffin 

 Islands, to Labrador and northwestern Greenland, north of latitude 66°, 

 south to the mountains of Vancouver and of central northern British 

 Columbia (Ingenika, Chapa-atan, and Sheslay Rivers, where it inter- 

 grades with L. m. dixoni), Great Slave Lake, Great Whale River, and 

 the Straits of Belle Isle. 



Winters throughout but probably mostly in the southern part of its 

 breeding range and possibly (rarely) farther south. 



Type locality. — Hudson Bay.

Small wood grouse (length about 165-187 mm.) with a general re- 

 semblance in form to Dendragapus but with only 16 (instead of usual 20) 

 rectrices, and adult males without an inflatable air sac on sides of neck; 

 coloration very different. 



Bill relatively small, its length from frontal antiae about one-fourth 

 the length of head, its depth at same point about equal to its width; 

 culmen very indistinctly ridged ; rhamphotheca smooth throughout ; maxil-

lary tomium distinctly but not strongly concave or arched. Wing moder- 

 ate or rather small, with longest primaries projecting beyond tips of 

 longest secondaries between one-fourth and one-third the length of wing ; 

 third and fourth primaries longest (the fifth nearly as long), the first 

 (outermost) intermediate between seventh and eighth; inner webs of 

 three outer primaries slightly emarginate or sinuate. Tail about two- 

 thirds as long as wing, more or less rounded, the rectrices (16) broad, 

 with tips broadly rounded (C. canadensis) or nearly truncate (C. 

 jranklinii). Tarsus less than one-fourth as long as wing, completely and 

 densely clothed with soft, hairlike feathers; except on heel, the basal 

 phalanx of middle toe also feathered along each side (except in sum-

 surface of toes with a continuous series of transverse scutella, margined 

 along each side by a row of rather small more or less quadrate scales; 

 edges of toes distinctly fringed or pectinated in winter, but not in 

 summer. 



Plumage and coloration. — Feathers of crown slightly elongated, form- 

 ing a moderate crest when erected ; a nude superciliary space, larger and 

 brightly colored in adult males in summer; no tufts nor air sac on side 

 of neck ; plumage in general rather compact, with feathers distinctly out- 

 lined, except on anal region, where soft, downy, and blended. Adult 

 males barred with black and grayish above, the tail plain blackish, some- 

 times tipped with cinnamon-rufous; throat, cheek, breast, etc., black, 

 the former margined with white spotting, the feathers along sides, etc., 

 and under tail coverts (sometimes upper tail coverts also) broadly tipped 

 with white. Adult females barred above with blackish and rusty or 

 bufly, beneath everywhere barred and spotted with blackish, buffy, 

 and white. 



Range. — Northern coniferous forests of North America (Hudsonian 

 and Canadian Zones). (Two species.)

 rump like the interscapulars but with the dark areas narrower, the paler 

 interspaces more numerous; lesser upper wing coverts like the back but 

 paler, the dark areas less intense and, except for the subterminal band, 

 the markings more crescentic and the brown areas mottled with dusky; 

 median and greater upper wing coverts dark olive-brown, indistinctly 

 mottled and submarginally irregularly marked with paler — snuff brown 

 to light olive-brown ; secondaries like the greater upper coverts but with 

 the paler color restricted to the outer margins and the tips of the feathers ; 

 the innermost few pairs with the pale tips extending backward along the 

 shaft in a proximally pointed, distally expanded white wedge-shaped 

 mark; primaries dark olive-brown to fuscous, the outer webs of the 

 second, third, fourth, and fifth pairs (from the outside) largely whitish; 

 short upper tail coverts like the rump but with grayer tips; long upper 

 tail coverts fuscous, laterally mottled and vermiculated with pale olive- 

 brown, and broadly tipped with white, the feathers graduated, increas- 

 ing in length centripetally, so that in the closed tail the white tips 

 form a longitudinal series of white blotches; rectrices deep fuscous, the 

 median pair very narrowly tipped with white, the others either without 

 pale tips or very faintly tipped with snuff brown; chin, upper throat, 

 cheeks, and lower auriculars black, the whole area bounded by a narrow 

 white line beginning below the eyes, forming a circle open only in front 

 of the eyes (and, in many specimens, this is continued to the bill by a 

 narrow white subloreal line) ; sides of neck and lower throat like the 

 nape but the feathers of the midventral hne blacker, and with whitish 

 terminal edges; breast and an area extending dorsally to a point over 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 139 



and in front of the bend of the wing, blackish with a faint bluish sheen, 

 the brownish basal areas often showing also ; this blackish area extending 

 caudally along the midline of the upper abdomen, giving this area a poste- 

 riorly convex outline ; the extreme dorsal-lateral feathers of the black area 

 narrowly tipped with bright snuff brown to pale tawny, the lateral ones 

 with broad white tips; lower abdomen blackish but with the white tips 

 much broader and with some white bars and subterminal shaft spots 

 making the area as much white as blackish; sides and flanks grayish 

 Sayal brown to Saccardo's umber with a series of concentric irregular 

 bands of dark olive-brown and with a medioterminal white wedge-shaped 

 mark, the dark olive-brown bands becoming transverse bars on the flank 

 feathers, which also have the white wedges reduced and flattened into 

 terminal bands; thighs narrowly barred dusky olive-brown and pale 

 grayish snuff brown; under tail coverts black, very broadly tipped with 

 white, the feathers graduated so that in the closed tail the white tips 

 appear almost like a broad longitudinal band, while in the open tail they 

 form a circle incomplete only at the base ; under wing coverts dark olive- 

 brown to fuscous, some with whitish tips and narrow white outer edges ; 

 those near the bend of the wing with pale snuff -brown edges; iris Van- 

 dyke brown; bill black; "comb" scarlet-vermiHon ; feet gray, soles tinged 

 yellow. 



Adult female, gray phase. — Forehead, crown, and occiput barred black, 

 smoke gray, and ochraceous-buff ; nape similar but with the gray pre- 

 dominant at the expense of the ochraceous-buff; interscapulars, upper 

 back, and scapulars black conspicuously barred with ochraceous-buff and 

 inconspicuously tipped with grayish; feathers of the back, lower ,back, 

 and rump blackish tipped with smoke gray and with a usually concealed 

 pale ochraceous-buff bar about two-thirds of the way from the base to 

 the tip, these bars occasionally showing ; wings as in male but less brown- 

 ish, the feather edgings hair brown with a faint tawny wash, the dark 

 areas fuscous ; the light outer edges of primaries 2 to 5, inclusive, some- 

 what mottled with dusky, and all the remiges very narrowly tipped with 

 whitish, this being least noticeable on the outer primaries ; upper tail 

 coverts black tipped with white (the white tips less than half as wide 

 as in the males) apd banded with pale grayish ochraceous-buff ; rectrices 

 blackish narrowly tipped with white and abundantly but irregularly 

 crossed and mottled with cinnamon-buff to tawny-olive, these markings 

 largely restricted to the outer edges of the outer webs of the lateral 

 feathers and extending across both webs in the more median ones ; lores, 

 postocular stripe, chin, and upper throat white speckled or barred with 

 dark fuscous ; auriculars tawny-olive spotted with dark fuscous ; lower 

 throat and breast pale ochraceous-buff heavily banded with fuscous-black, 

 the feathers of the breast more extensively black than ochraceous-buff, 

 the latter color brighter there than on the lower throat ; abdomen sharply 




140 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



distinct, white, instead of ochraceous-buff and the dark fuscous-black bands 

 more continuous, less broken than on the breast feathers; sides, flanks, 

 and thighs as in the male — ^but more ochraceous; under tail coverts as 

 in the male but with more white bars (not only the terminal one as in 

 the males); iris Vandyke brown; "comb" vermiHon; bill blackish; feet 

 pale brownish gray, claws blackish. 



Adult female, rufous phase. — Similar to the gray phase but with the 

 ochraceous-buff extending over the whole underparts from the chm to as 

 far as the middle of the abdomen, and brighter, slightly more ochraceous- 

 tawny as well ; a,bove the ochraceous color more pronounced on the head, 

 nape, interscapulars, lower back, rump, and upper tail coverts; the pale 

 markings on the wings more buffy — pale grayish clay color; rectrices 

 often with narrow buffy tips or subterminal blotches. 



Immature male. — Like the adult but with the juvenal outer primaries 

 (narrowly marked with buff on the outer webs instead of whitish as in 

 adults) and with the rectrices more often tipped very narrowly with 

 whitish. 



Immature female. — Like the adult of the corresponding phase but with 

 the juvenal outer primaries; not readily distinguishable in many cases. 



luvenal (sexes alike). — Above similar to the adult female, rufous 

 phase, but with the scapulars and inner secondaries with white terminal 

 shaft streaks and these feathers abundantly marked with concentric longi- 

 tudinal as well as transverse ochraceous-buff irregular bands; the inter- 

 scapulars and upper wing coverts with small medioterminal white marks ;

 blackish; and the lower abdomen, flanks, and thighs dirty smoke gray 

 indistinctly bari-ed with dusky; iris Vandyke brown; "comb" pale ver- 

 milion; lower mandible yellowish beneath at base, brownish elsewhere.

CANACHITES CANADENSIS CANADENSIS (Linnaeus) 



Hudsonian Spruce Partridge 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Canachites franklinii but rectrices with 

 broad ochraceous-tawny tips and upper tail coverts without broad white 

 tips (tips usually not more than 4 mm. wide, as opposed to 10 mm.) in 

 franklinii, and usually gray, not white, and when white very seldom with- 

 out a grayish tinge) ; general color of upper parts variable, terminal mar- 

 gins of the feathers varying from gull gray to grayish drab ; the margins of 

 the upper wing coverts from buffy hair brown to Saccardo's umber; 

 sides and flanks likewise varying from bufify hair brown to Saccardo's 

 umber^* ; bill dark gray or blackish ; feet dusky ; iris brown. 



Adult female. — Like that of the same phase of Canachite.? franklinii 

 but without tips to the longer upper tail, coverts and with the rectrices 

 tipped with ochraceous-buff. 



Immature male. — Similar to the adult but with the juvenal outer 

 primaries. 



Immature female. — Similar to the adult of the corresponding phase but 

 with the juvenal outer primaries. 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Like the adult female of the rufous phase 

 but still more rufescent, the crown varying from cinnamon-rufous to 



°° The palest bird seen is from Fort Simpson, Mackenzie ; the darkest ones are 

 from British Columbia and Labrador. A careful study of these variations, how- 

 ever, bears out Uttal's contention that there is not enough constant geographic varia- 

 tion to warrant the recognition of the supposedly paler Yukon-Mackenzie race 

 named osgoodi by Bishop in 1900. 




144 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



hazel marked with black; the ,back and upper wing coverts vary from 

 ochraceous-tawny to bright tawny with black bars or blotches, and with 

 wide huffy shaft stripes expanding into whitish wedge-shaped tips ; remiges 

 sepia, the primaries narrowly marked with buff ; the innermost secondaries 

 and the scapulars irregularly barred and speckled with ochraceous-tawny ; 

 rectrices more pointed than in adults and fuscous barred, speckled, and 

 irregularly vermiculated with ochraceous-tawny; abdomen grayish white 

 indistinctly barred or spotted with dusky and sometimes with a faint 

 yellowish wash; chin and throat white with a buffy yellowish wash. 



Downy young. — Very similar to that of Canachites franklinii but with 

 the upper back more extensively cream buff, the rest of the back between 

 amber Jirown and antique brown, more or less diluted with buffy. 



Adult male.— Wing 165-194 (180.4); tail 108-142 (121.9); exposed

 River, and Mount McKinley areas of Alaska (McKinley Park, Nulato 

 River, Kowak River, Happy River, Tanana, Circle, etc.) to Yukon 

 (60° 40' N) ; Mackenzie (Mackenzie River, Gros Cape, Fort Simpson, 

 etc.) ; northern Saskatchewan and Alberta (Smith Landing, Athabasca, 

 etc.) ; northern Manitoba (Fort Churchill, York Factory) ; northern

Nova Scotian Spruce Partridge 



Adult male. — Very similar to that of the nominate race but said to 

 have the plumage more suffused with browrn, especially the upper wing 

 coverts, upper dorsals, scapulars, and flank feathers.^" 



Adult female. — Similar to that of Canachites canadensis canace, but 

 the brown markings more intense, the rufous phase much more reddish 

 tawny than in canace, the gray phase only slightly more so than in the 

 corresponding stage of canace. 



°° The material examined in the present work does not bear this out. Birds from

 monotypy, Tetrao umhellus Linnaeus.) 



Hylobrontes Stone, Auk, xxiv, 1907, 198. (Type, by original designation and 

 monotypy, Tetrao umhellus Linnaeus.) (New name to replace Bonasa Stephens, 

 thought to be transferable to Tetrao cupido Linnaeus under the "first species" 

 rule.) 



Medium-sized wood grouse (length about 394—482 mm.) with lower 

 half (more or less) of tarsus nude and scutellate; tail nearly if not quite 

 as long as wing, fan-shaped, with 18-20 rectrices, three relatively broad, 

 with broadly rounded or subtruncate tips ; sides of neck without inflatable 

 air sacs, but with a conspicuous erectile tuft of large, broad, slightly 

 rounded or nearly truncate soft, decumbent feathers (less developed in 

 females). 



Bill relatively small, its length from nostril about one-third the length 

 of head, its depth at frontal antiae about equal to its width at same point, 

 the culmen slightly ridged, the rhamphotheca smooth throughout, the 

 maxillary tomium regularly and rather deeply concave. Wing moderate 

 in size, deeply concave beneath, the longest primaries exceeding longest 

 secondaries by about one-third the length of wing; third or third and 

 fourth primaries longest, the first (outermost) intermediate between 

 seventh and eighth. Tail nearly as long as wing, slightly to distinctly 

 rounded, the rectrices (18-20) becoming gradually broader distally, their 

 tips broadly rounded or subtruncate. Tarsus less than one-fourth as long 

 as wing, its upper half (more or less) densely clothed with rather long, 

 hairlike but soft feathers (much shorter in summer), the lower portion 

 nude and scutellate, the acrotarsium with two rows of rather large scutella, 

 the planta tarsi with small hexagonal scales ; middle toe decidedly shorter 

 than tarsus, the inner toe reaching to penultimate articulation of middle

toe, the outer toe slightly longer, hallux about as long as basal phalanx 

 of lateral toe or very slightly shorter; top of toes with a continuous row 

 of rather large transverse scutella, with a row of much smaller subquad- 

 rate scutella along each side, outside of which are horny pectinations or 

 fringelike processes (these less distinct in summer) ; claws moderate 

 in size and curvature, rather blunt, that of hallux smaller. 



Figure 10. — Bonasa umhellus. 



Plumage and coloration. — Plumage in general soft, the remiges, espe- 

 cially the primaries, firm, almost rigid ; feathers rather distinctly out- 

 lined, except on lower abdomen, anal region, and thighs, where soft, 

 downy, and blended, those of sides and flanks large and very broad ; a 

 naked space immediately above eye (most developed as brightly colored — 

 orange or red-^in males during summer) ; feathers of crown distinctly 

 elongated, forming, when erected, a rather conspicuous crest; on each 

 side of neck a conspicuous erectile tuft of large, very broad, soft, nearly 

 truncate, decumbent feathers. Upperparts variegated with black, buff 

 and different tones of brown and rusty or gray, the tail, scapulars, and 

 wing coverts streaked with buff or whitish, the rump with rather small 

 cordate or ovate spots of pale grayish or dull buffy; tail gray or rusty, 

 with numerous irregular or zigzag narrow bars of blackish and with a 

 broad subterminal band of blackish or dark brown ; neck tufts black, dark 

 brown, or chestnut, each feather with a glossy or semimetallic terminal 

 margin or bar ; throat buffy or ochraceous, sometimes with dusky mark- 

 ings; rest of underparts buff or whitish, more or less broken by broad 

 bars of brownish, these much broader and darker on flanks. 



Range. — Wooded portions of North America, except in Lower Austral 

 Life Zone. (Monotypic.)

BONASA UMBELLUS UMBELLUS (Linnaeus) 



Eastern Ruffed Grouse 



Adult male (brown phase). — Feathers of the forehead, crown, and 

 occiput sayal brown to cinnamon-brown, barred with blackish, and tipped 

 with smoke gray to pale smoke gray; the elongated crest feathers with 

 the blackish extended toward the base on the outer edges of both webs, 

 leaving the brown as a broad basal shaft stripe with lateral branches, the 

 blackish marks very narrowly edged on their distal margins with cinnamon- 

 brown; nape sayal brown to cinnamon-brown tipped with smoke gray; 

 interscapulars similarly brownish, but with the smoke gray confined to 

 the distal portion of the shaft and a large terminal shaft spot, the re- 

 maining part of the feathers irregularly crossed by blackish marks which 

 fail to connect toward the shaft ; the outermost of these marks often very 

 broad (8-10 mm.) ; neck ruffs either deep black with a slight bluish 

 purplish sheen, dark fuscous-black with blue-black tips to the feathers, 

 or bright auburn with narrow fuscous tips to the feathers; upper back, 

 lower back, and rump cinnamon-brown to dark Brussels brown, the 

 feathers of the upper back with cordate terminal shaft spots of tilleul 

 buff to vinaceous-buff narrowly edged with black and occasionally sparsely 

 flecked with blackish ; the feathers of the lower back and rump with these 

 spots broader, more oval and with a distally converging V of blackish 

 within the light area, and the spots separated from the tips of the feathers 

 by 3 to 8 mm. of dark smoke gray; the rump feathers have the brown 

 areas faintly and sparsely vermiculated with blackish on their concealed 

 basal portions ; upper tail coverts cinnamon-brown, very broadly tipped 

 with smoke gray (about 15 mm. wide) and crossed by five or six narrow, 

 equally spaced, wavy, fuscous-black bands, each of which (except for 

 the most distal one, which borders on the proximal edge of the gray 

 terminal area) is distally followed by a narrow band (but which is wider 

 than the black band) of cinnamon-buff to pale tawny-olive, which in 

 turn is followed by a broken line of fine blackish dots; the gray tips are 

 finely speckled or vermiculated with black and have a large blotch of dark 

 fuscous-black edged with auburn in their middle portion ; lesser and 

 median upper wing coverts sayal brown to cinnamon-brown, very nar- 

 rowly and incompletely edged with blackish and with mesial streaks of 

 pale buffy white narrowly edged with dusky; greater upper secondary 

 coverts similar but with the brown areas faintly vermiculated with black- 

 ish; greater upper primary coverts fuscous, externally narrowly edged 

 with cinnamon-brown, the edging widest basally; primaries fuscous on 

 the inner webs and terminally on the outer ones, most of the outer webs 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 157 



cartridge buffy to buffy white, with five to seven dusky fuscescent 

 triangular bars, each of which has its base against the shaft and its apex 

 at the outer edge of the vane, causing the whitish areas to appear Hke 

 reversed triangles, these dusky marks becoming small and faint or disap- 

 pearing entirely on the distal third of the feathers; secondaries fuscous 

 externally broadly edged with sayal brown coarsely vermiculated with 

 fuscous, and tipped with drab ; the innermost secondaries have their inner 

 webs also margined with vermiculated sayal brown with a wash of drab ; 

 the scapulars like the greater secondary coverts but with the light mesial 

 streaks much wider and the adjacent part of the inner web extensively 

 blackish; rectrices cinnamon to clay color tipped broadly with smoke 

 gray with fine black vermiculations subterminally broadly banded with 

 fuscous-black to bister, this band sometimes breaking down to a series 

 of vermiculations in the median pair of rectrices (possibly in younger 

 adult birds) ; the subterminal dark band edged basally with another smoke- 

 gray band similar to the terminal one, and the remainder of the feathers 

 crossed by seven to nine narrow, wavy, fuscous-black bands, each of 

 which is followed distally by a band of cinnamon-buff, which in turn is 

 edged distally by a broken series of blackish vermiculations, which ex- 

 tend, in reduced size, into the brown interspaces ; loreal stripe pale pinkish 

 buff narrowly edged with blackish spots; lower eyelid a line of pinkish- 

 buff and black spots; feather of cheeks and auriculars elongated, sayal 

 brown, with blackish edges and pale ashy-brown shaft streaks ; chin whitish 

 washed with buffy or pale ochraceous-buff and the feathers sometimes 

 tipped narrowly with black ; throat light ochraceous-buff, becoming whitish 

 laterally on the upper throat, the feathers forming the lateral and posterior 

 portions of the gular area tipped with fuscous-black, producing a some- 

 what scalloped pattern; upper breast cinnamon-brown to light auburn, 

 each feather broadly tipped with smoke gray, so that in fresh plumage 

 the brown is largely obscured; the brown areas of the feathers basally 

 largely light pinkish cinnamon, with the darker cinnamon-brown forming 

 incomplete bands, especially subterminally; lower breast and upper and 

 lateral parts of the abdomen grayish white to pale smoke gray sub- 

 terminally crossed by broad bands of wood brown to buffy brown 

 narrowly edged on both sides with darker, and the feathers washed 

 with buffy basally; the brownish subterminal bands usually largely 

 hidden by the grayish-white tips of the feathers, especially on the ab- 

 domen, these bands darker and more exposed on the lateral feathers 

 middle of abdomen with no brown, pure grayish white; feathers of 

 the sides sayal brown to Saccardo's umber slightly vermiculated with 

 blackish and with white shaft streaks that expand distally into broad 

 terminal spots, flanks similar but the brown areas ashier and more 

 vermiculated, the vermiculations forming narrow bands, the shaft streaks 

 washed with grayish and not expanding into terminal spots; thighs 




158 BULLETIN BO, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



drab to whitish washed with pale vinaceous-buff ; under tail coverts 

 clay color to cinnamon-buff, broadly tipped with white, the white some- 

 times extending back in a narrow streak along the shaft, the brown parts 

 frequently with a few blackish spots; under wing coverts sayal brown 

 to Saccardo's umber with whitish mesial streaks ; axillars white banded 

 broadly with sayal brown; iris hazel; bill dark brown; feet dark grayish 

 olive with a brownish wash. 



Adult male (gray phase). — Similar to the red phase except that the 

 interscapulars, back, lower back, rump feathers, and upper wing coverts 

 have the brown areas vermiculated and irregularly banded with smoke 

 gray, the feathers completely margined with the same; the upper tail 

 coverts and the rectrices have the rufescent replaced by smoke gray, which 

 is generally somewhat more abundantly flecked and vermiculated with 

 black than in the red phase; the subterminal band is usually fuscous to 

 fuscous-black, but occasionally it is dark argus brown (in which examples 

 the ruffs are usually auburn with blackish tips) ; the outer margin of 

 the greater upper primary coverts paler — wood brown ; the sides, flanks, 

 and thighs ashier, and the brown on the under tail coverts reduced largely 

 to narrow, incomplete cross bars.^* 



Adult female (both phases).— Similar to the corresponding males but 

 averaging smaller with shorter ruffs, the gray phase females less pure 

 gray on the tail, more mixed or washed with rufescent than in gray males, 

 and the pectoral area in both phases more extensively tawny or hazel; 

 the cordate spots on the feathers of the back and rump smaller than in 

 the males and also more washed with avellaneous to wood brown. 



Immature (both sexes). — Similar to the adults of the corresponding 

 sex and phase, but the ruffs slightly duller and slightly smaller; birds 

 in this stage may be told, however, chiefly by the fact that they have 

 the two outer primaries of the juvenal plumage, which differ from the 

 adult feathers in that their outer webs are not cartridge buff or whitish 

 marked with sayal brown but pale fuscous mottled and stippled with 

 pinkish buff to pale cinnamon-buff.''° 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Similar to the adult female but browner above, 

 more abundantly marked with sayal brown to Saccardo's umber on the 

 underparts, but these marks more irregularly disposed, not so clearly 

 forming bars, but something between bars and heavy transverse mottling ; 



"In winter, grouse (both sexes) differ from summer birds in the presence of 

 "snowshoes" caused by the growth of the lateral scales on the toes, and also in 

 more extensive grayish tips and margins to the feathers which wear off by spring. 



"° In literature one finds statements to the effect that the juvenal primaries, such 

 as are retained in the immature plumage, are "light vinaceous cinnamon unmarked 

 except for a very fine sprinkling of a slightly darker shade . .," but the only 

 difference between them and adult primaries is confined to their outer webs as 

 given above. 




BIHDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 159 



tail feathers lacking the heavy black subterminal band and having the 

 smoke-gray tips poorly developed; the narrow blackish rectricial bands 

 (about as in the adults in number) each followed distally by a band of pale 

 sayal brown or cinnamon, lighter than the rest of the feather, or by a 

 band of pale smoke gray (possibly birds that would become gray-phased 

 later on?) ; head quite different from adult — ^forehead, crown, and occiput 

 snuff brown to Saccardo's umber spotted with fuscous-black, a bufEy- 

 whitish line from the loreal antiae to the eye, both eyelids, and continuing 

 back of the eye to the sides of the occiput; cheeks and auriculars snuff 

 brown to Saccardo's umber, the former spotted with dusky sepia to 

 fuscous-black; chin and most of upper throat whitish unmarked; the 

 feathers of the back and rump and upper taU coverts different from the 

 adult — ashy sayal brown narrowly barred with sepia to fuscous; iris 

 hazel brown; bill "brown and slate," feet bluish white. 



Donmy young. — Forehead, crown, occiput, and nape pale ochraceous- 

 tawny, darkening medially and posteriorly to tawny and paling laterally 

 to light ochraceous-buff on the sides of the crown and occiput and on 

 the lores, cheeks, and auriculars, the middorsal area from the nape to 

 the tail bright russet, this area widening very considerably on the lower 

 back, the body down on each side of this ochraceous-buff becoming lighter 

 ventraUy, entire underparts ivory yellow to light cream buff, a fuscous- 

 black line extending from the hind end of the eye to the posterolateral 

 angle of the occiput; upper surface of wings pale russet, under surface 

 cream buff.

BONASA UMBELLUS MEDIANA Todd 



Midwestern Ruffed Grouse 



Adults. — Very similar to the corresponding sex and phase of B. u. 

 umhellus but very sHghtly paler, the top and sides of the head and neck

with a pale grayish suffusion, the breast averaging less extensively washed 

 with brownish, the abdomen averaging more albescent, and, in the brown 

 phase, the tail paler, nearly ochraceous-tawny (in the brown phase of 

 umhellus it is nearly hazel). On the whole this race is more often gray- 

 tailed than brown-tailed, while the reverse is true of the nominate form. 



Juvenal and downy young apparently unknown. 



Adult male.— Wing 174-185 (178.9); tail 140-163 (150.6); culmen 

 from base 25.2-30.6 (27.8) ; tarsus 41.8-45.8 (43.5) ; middle toe without 

 claw 345-39.5 (36.8) ; unfeathered part of tarsus 18.4-30.2 (23.8 mm.).«9 



Adult female.— Wing 174-183 (176.6) ; tail 127-159 (141.3) ; culmen 

 from base 26.0-28.2 (27.3) ; tarsus 40.8^4.8 (42.7) ; middle toe without 

 claw 345-37.4 (35.4) ; unfeathered part of tarsus 21.6-30.0 (25.4 mm.).^» 



Range. — Climax and subclimax deciduous woodland of the oak-hickory 

 association in the eastern deciduous forest biome (Upper Austral Life 

 Zone) ; from southwestern Michigan, southern Wisconsin, and east cen- 

 tral Minnesota (Elk River) ; south, east of the Great Plains grassland, 

 to central Arkansas (Hot Springs). To the east Bonasa umhellus 

 mediana intergrades with Bonasa umbellus monticola, over a broad area 

 in southern Michigan, eastern Indiana, and western Ohio, and probably 

 formerly in western Kentucky and Tennessee.

BONASA UMBELLUS MONTICOLA Todd 



Appalachian Ruffed Grouse 



Adult (brown phase). — Similar to that of Bonasa unihcllus umbellus, 

 but the general coloration darker, the underparts more regularly and 

 more heavily barred and more strongly suffused with buffy; the upper- 

 parts more brownish, less rufescent — Prout's brown (instead of cinnamon- 




164 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



brown as in umbellus) ; the ventral bars becoming dark (dark sepia to 

 clove brown) on the flanks. 



Adult (gray phase).— Similar to that of B. u. umbellus, but the upper 

 and lower back darker, more brownish, with little or no grayish mixture, 

 the tail apparently never so pure gray but always with a faint huffy tinge ; 

 ventral bars darker, as in the brown phase, but the underparts less washed. 



Juvenal. — There seem to be two phases in this plumage, both (as 

 far as available material goes) with brown tails, but one considerably 

 grayer than the other (which is difficult to interpret as the great majority 

 of the adults are brown-phased in this race) : in the browner of the 

 two phases juvenals are like those of B. u. umbellus but darker, browner, 

 less rufescent above, the blackish marks on the upperparts larger, and 

 the ventral barrings darker as in the adults; in the grayer of the two 

 phases, the areas of the nape, interscapulars, upper wing coverts, back, 

 rump, and upper tail coverts that are Dresden brown to Saccardo's umber 

 in the brown phase are wood brown ; the pale areas of the interscapulars 

 are pinkish buff (as opposed to cinnamon-buff to pale clay color in the 

 browner phase), and the ventral barrings are darker and less rufescent — 

 huffy brown to sepia. 



Downy young. — Indistinguishable from that of the nominate race. 



Adult male.— Wing 172-196 (186.8); tail 139-181 (160); culmen 

 from base 24.4-31 (27.4) ; tarsus 40^8.2 (44.5) ; middle toe without 

 claw 32.8-40 (36.5) ; unfeathered part of tarsus 21.4-34.5 (28.5 mm.).''i 



Adult female.— Wing 166-190 (178.6) ; tail 121-156 (134.8) ; culmen 

 from base 23.8-29.3 (26.6); tarsus 37.4-45 (41.1); middle toe with- 

 out claw 32.2-39.6 (35.1) ; unfeathered part of tarsus of 19.4-33.6 

 (27.2 mm.). ^2 



Range. — Climax and subclimax deciduous forest communities of the 

 mixed mesophitic association in the eastern deciduous forest biome (Upper 

 Austral Life Zone) in the eastern United States and the ecotone between 

 this biome and the Canadian Zone coniferous forest of the Appalachian 

 Mountains (pine-maple-beech-hemlock association) ; north to north- 

 eastern Pennsylvania, northeastern Ohio, and southeastern Michigan, east 

 to northeastern and south-central Pennsylvania, central Maryland, north- 

 eastern, central, and southwestern Virginia, southwestern North Caro- 

 lina, and northern Georgia; south to northern Georgia and northeastern 

 Alabama. The western limit of the range of this race is ill defined be- 

 cause of the fact that the species has been extirpated over much of the 

 Mississippi Valley region where it formerly occurred. Bonasa umbellus 

 monticola intergrades with mediana in central southern Michigan, eastern

BONASA UMBELLUS SABINI (Doaglas) • 



Pacific Ruffed Grouse 



Adult (brown phase) . — Similar to that of Bonasa umbellus umbellus but 

 much more darkly and richly colored (darker and richer than B. u. 

 monticola also) ; the black markings above more extensive and conspicu- 

 ous, the areas which are sayal brown to cinnamon-brown in umbellus be- 

 ing orange-cinnamon, cinnamon-rufous, or hazel, those that are cinnamon- 

 brown to dark Brussels brown in umbellus are bright dark amber brown 

 to rufescent argus brown ; rectrices bright amber brown ; ventral barrings 

 darker — dark Dresden brown narrowly edged with fuscous, the lateral 

 bars (on sides and flanks darker still) — mummy brown to clove brown; 

 thighs darker — wood brown to avellaneous tinged with cinnamon-buff. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 167 



There are two varieties of this phase agreeing in all respects except the 

 color of the breast ; in one variety this area is blackish, the feathers nar- 

 rowly tipped with whitish or tawny, while in the other there is no black 

 but the feathers are bright tawny, becoming mummy brown only basally. 



Adult (gray phase). — Similar to the brown phase but with the feathers 

 of the crown, occiput, and nape tipped with smoke gray; those of the 

 upper and lower back, rump, and upper tail coverts terminally edged 

 with pale neutral gray vermiculated with blackish; rectrices as in the 

 gray phase of B. u. umbellus but darker, more washed with wood brown. 



Juvenal. — None seen. 



Downy young. — Indistinguishable from that of B. u. umbellus.

 are double with a pale ochraceous band in between them) ; underparts 

 as in the brown phase but much less washed with buflEy. 



Juvenal.— Svcmlar to that of B. u. umbellus but darker brown (darker 

 than Juvenal monticola also) ; above, cinnamon-brown to Prout's brown

of the city of Vancouver north at least to Lund. There are no records 

 for the ruffed grouse on the coast of British Columbia between this

 doubtful if brunnescens ranges much farther north than the immediate 

 vicinity of Vancouver Island.

BONASA UMBELLUS AFFINIS Aldrich and Friedmann 



Columbian Ruffed Grouse 



Adult (gray phase). — Similar to the corresponding phase of Bonasa 

 umbellus umbellus but darker, more brownish above, more heavily barred 

 below (in its general appearance intermediate between the gray phase of 

 umbellus and that of sabini) ; feathers of top of head more solidly blackish 

 edged with smoke gray, and basally pale ochraceous-tawny on their hidden 

 portions; interscapulars and inner upper wing coverts cinnamon-brown 

 with large blotches and some vermiculations of fuscous to black, and with 

 pale shaft streaks of tilleul buff to pale smoke gray; feathers of upper 

 back similar but with less blackish and more mottled with smoke gray 

 on their terminal portions; feathers of lower back, rump, and upper tail 

 coverts Prout's brown, sparingly vermiculated with black, with broad, 

 tear-shaped, whitish shaft spots, which are longitudinally streaked and 

 edged narrowly with black, the feathers edged with smoke gray, the 

 extent of the terminal gray increasing on the upper tail coverts ; rectrices 

 darker gray than in umbellus — smoke gray to light grayish olive with 

 a faint ochraceous tinge especially along the shaft and on the proximal 

 edge of each of the black wavy bands ; and slightly more heavily vermicu- 

 lated with black; below more heavily barred, the bars dusky isabelline 

 to tawny-olive, darkening on the sides and flanks to sepia and mummy 

 brown; the lower throat and upper breast more strongly washed with 




176 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STj! 



ochraceous-tawny than in umbellus of the same phase. The gray phase 

 is commoner than the brown one. 



Adult (brown phase). — Similar to the gray phase but the tail sayal 

 brown with a cinnamon wash, instead of smoke gray, the upperparts of 

 the head and body and the upper wing coverts browner, less grayish, more 

 rufescent, but not so rufescent as the brown phase of sabini — the pale 

 shaft streaks of the interscapulars pale ochraceous-tawny, the upper back 

 and the lateral brown areas of the interscapulars Dresden brown to 

 mikado brown vermiculated with blackish, lower back and rump dark 

 mikado brown to rufescent Front's brown; ventral barrings darker than 

 in the gray phase — Dresden brown darkening on the sides and flanks 

 to mummy brown. This phase is like the brown phase of togata, but has 

 the black markings less extensive. 



Juvenal. — Similar to that of B. u. umbellus but very slightly more ru- 

 fescent (more than in monticola also) above and with the ventral bars 

 darker — sepia to mummy brown; the rectrices and the outer webs of 

 the secondaries bright ochraceous-tawny. 



Downy young. — None seen. 



Adult male.—Wmg 171-191 (181.7); tail 130-170 (1S2.4) ; culmen 

 from base 23.4-28.8 (26.3) ; tarsus 40.4-45.5 (42.9) ; middle toe without 

 claw 34.2-41.0 (37.6) ; unfeathered part of tarsus 14.5-29.2 (21.6 mm.)." 



Adult female.— Wmg 170-185 (176.2); tail 123-157 (132.4); culmen 

 from base 23.9-28.4 (26.2) ; tarsus 36.0-42.2 (40.6) ; middle toe without 

 claw 32.5-39.3 (35.2) ; unfeathered part of tarsus 14.0-25.0 (19.4 mm.).^^ 



This race is intermediate between sabini on the one hand and umbelloides 

 and phaia on the other. 



Range. — Subclimax deciduous woodlands (aspen, poplar, and willow 

 communities) of the montane and subalpine forests (Transition and 

 Canadian Life Zones) ; from Fort Klamath and Harney, Oreg., north- 

 ward, east of the Cascades, excluding the mountains of northeastern 

 Oregon, southeastern and northeastern Washington, through the interior 

 of British Columbia, to Hazelton, and to Canyon Island, Taku River, near 

 Juneau, southeastern Alaska. Specimens from Bear Lake in north-central 

 British Columbia and from Telegraph Creek farther to the northwest in 

 the same province are intermediate between affinis and umbelloides; birds 

 from southeastern Alaska are darker than typical affinis. 



The range of Bonasa umbellus affinis, as here delineated, includes 

 populations of much paler and more grayish birds from the more arid 

 interior regions of Washington and Oregon. The extreme examples of 

 this type are found among specimens from Tunk Mountain, Aeneas, 

 Twisp, Mazama, Molson, and Oroville, in Okanogan County, and Swan 



"Forty-two specimens from British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. 

 "Sixteen specimens from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. 




BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 177 



Lake and Curlew in Ferry County, Wash. Apparently there is here 

 represented a well-marked "ecological race" which shows a greater re- 

 semblance to incana than anything else and yet completely cut off from 

 that form by ajjhiis and phaia. This may be a case of morphological and 

 ecological parallelism, since in central northern Washington the prairie 

 grassland merges with the montane forest in muck the same way that it 

 does in Utah and Wyoming, where typical incana occurs. Since the 

 variation seems not to have a geographical range distinct from affinis, it 

 is not here given a subspecific name. A more thorough study of the 

 problem in the field, however, might show such recognition to be desirable 

 on the basis of ecological segregation of the type mentioned by Miller 

 (Amer. Midi. Nat., Ixxvi, 1942, 34) in certain species of the San Fran- 

 cisco Bay region.

 much paler, the palest of all the races of the species, the whitish areas 

 above more extensive and purer vifhite, less washed with huffy ; nearest 

 to the gray phase of incana but paler, with more white, and with the 

 most extensive tarsal feathering of all the subspecies; the gray areas 

 of the upperparts of head, body, wings, and tail pale neutral gray to 

 smoke gray, the brown, restricted to the top of the head, the inter- 

 scapulars, wings, and middle of the back, is pale tawny-olive to pale 

 Saccardo's umber; below as in umbellus but more abundantly barred 

 with buffy drab. 



Adult (brown phase). — Similar to the gray phase but with the tail 

 between sayal brown and Saccardo's umber distally vermiculated and 

 washed with smoke gray, with the feathers of the interscapulars, back, 

 and rump with very broad transverse subterminal bands of mummy ,brown 

 (these bands present but concealed in the gray phase), and with the 

 ventral barrings darker — Dresden brown to mummy brown. 



Juvenal (female only seen). — Above much grayer than any seen of 

 B. u. umbellus, nearest to that of B. u. phaia, the general coloration of 

 the upper side of the head, body, and wings being drab to hair brown, 

 the interscapulars, scapulars, crown, and upper back being broadly trans- 

 versely blotched with fuscous to black, and with pale tilleul-buff shaft 

 streaks and narrow cross bars of slightly darker tilleul buff; rectrices as 

 in phaios but slightly more washed with drab. 



Downy young. — None seen. 



Adult fimle.—Wmg 174-190 (182); tail 129-168 (148.5); culmen 

 from base 24.9-29.1 (26.8) ; tarsus 38.3-45.0 (42.4) ; middle toe without

 Pierre House, east at least to Great Slave Lake and Lake Atha.baska, 

 and southward along the Liard River, at least to Fort Liard, Mackenzie, 

 and along the Athabaska River to Fort McMurray, Alberta. There are 

 records of ruffed grouse from farther east in the Hudsonian Zone of 

 northern Manitoba (Brochet and York Factory) which may also belong 

 to this race, but specimens have not been seen to substantiate this. 

 Although primarily a Hudsonian Zone form, yukonensis apparently in- 

 cludes within its range a sizable area characterized by pure coniferous 

 forest climax (Canadian Zone) in southwestern Mackenzie and northern 

 Alberta.

BONASA UMBELLUS UMBELLOIDES (Donelas) 



Gray Ruffed Grouse 



Adult (gray phase). — Similar to the corresponding phase of Bonasa 

 iimbellus uvibellus but much less brownish, more grayish and darker, 

 being closest in appearance to the gray phase of phaia from which it 

 differs in being paler gray (and the brown areas paler also) above, less 

 heavily barred below, and with a longer part of the tarsus feathered. 

 The gray of the feathers of the nape, back, rump, upper tail coverts, 

 and the tail smoke gray lightly vermiculated with fuscous to blackish; 

 the brown areas of the interscapulars cinnamon-brown to russet heavily 

 blotched with black; the brown of the upper surface of the wings dull 

 Saccardo's umber speckled and washed with grayish ; below more heavily 

 banded than umbellus, less so than phaia, the brown bands averaging 

 slightly darker than in umbellus — pale tawny-olive darkening on the 

 sides and flanks to sepia; tarsus feathered for more than half its length. 



Adult (brown phase). — Similar to the gray phase but with the tail 

 tawny-olive instead of gray and interscapulars and upper surface of the 

 wings slightly more extensively brownish, and the breast and upper ab- 

 domen averaging more washed with tawny-buff. 



Juvenal (brown phase). — Similar to the corresponding plumage of 

 B. u. umbellus but less rufescent, more grayish, the general color of the 

 upperparts of the head, body, and wings being buffy brown to grayish 

 olive-brown, the rectrices between wood brown and drab ; ventral barring 

 darker — grayish buffy brown. 



Juvenal (gray phase). — Like the brown phase but gray — the ground 

 color of the upperparts of the body and wings and tail being grayish drab 

 to ashy hair brown ; ventral barrings darker — mummy brown, the under- 

 parts less washed with buffy. 



Downy young. — Not distinguishable from that of the nominate race. 



Adult male.— Wing 171-195 (182.6); tail 144-174 (157.7); culmen 

 from base 24.4-29.4 (26.3) ; tarsus 39-45.5 (42.5) ; middle toe without

"Although specimens from northern Ontario and middle Quebec average slightly 

 darker and have a greater proportion of the tarsus unfeathered than typical 

 umbelloides from the east slopes of the Canadian Rockies, the difference seems to 

 be too slight to recognize as a distinct subspecies. These characters merely indicate 

 the trend toward intergradation between umbelloides and togata. Therefore, 

 canescens Todd becomes a synonym of umbelloides. Ruffed grouse recorded farther 

 east in Quebec (Anticosti Island, Natashquan, and Wolf Bay) and in south- 

 eastern Labrador (Hamilton Inlet and Sandwich Bay) may belong to this race 

 also, but no specimens from these regions have been examined in the present study. 



Specimens from southern Manitoba (Shoal Lake and Carberry) are intermediate 

 between umbelloides, incana, and mediana, but on average characters, particularly 

 relatively short unfeathered tarsus, they seem a little closer to umbelloides.

KEY TO THE FORMS OF PEDIOECETES PHASIANELLUS (LINNAEUS) 



a. Darker above, the black or dark fuscous areas predominating, giving an appear- 

 ance of a dark bird barred with buffy brown and spotted with white. 

 b. Upperparts very dark, the brownish barrings and edges and tips of feathers 

 of mantle and upper back much reduced, marks in inner portions of vanes 

 very narrow or absent ; feathers of breast dark buffy brown with only narrow 

 white shaft stripes (central and northern Mackenzie). 



Pedioecetes phasianellus kennicottii (p. 193) 

 bb. Upperparts less dark, the brownish barrings and edges and tips of feathers well 

 developed. 

 c. White spots on upperparts much reduced ; feathers of breast pale buffy brown 

 with fairly broad white shaft stripes (Hudson's Bay region). 



Pedioecetes phasianellus phasianellus (p. 194)

 merely edged with dark olive-brown (Alaska, the Yukon district to ex- 

 treme northern British Colombia) . 



Pedioecetes phasianellus caurus (p. 190) 

 aa. Paler above, the brown areas larger, the blackish ones more hidden, giving the 

 appearance of a brownish bird mottled with blackish.

 branches reuniting on the nape; a few small black spots lateral to this 

 on the anterior part of the occiput and on the nape; rest of upperparts 

 straw yellow tinged strongly on the middorsal line with ochraceous-

PEDIOECETES PHASIANELLUS KENNICOTTII Snckley 



Mackenzie Sharp-tailed Grouse 



Adult innle. — Much darker and less barred and spotted than P- p. 

 caurus; forehead, crown, occiput, and nape mummy brown to dark sepia ; 

 a narrow whitish loreal-superciUary stripe on each side running posteriorly 

 in a somewhat broken line to the, sides of the nape, the feathers of the 

 forehead, sides of crown, the occiput, and nape narrowly edged and nar- 

 rowly barred with Saccardo's umber; interscapulars dark sepia with 

 hidden, small, incomplete and very sparse whitish shaft marks and with 

 a few tawny-buffy subterrainal spots, the feathers narrowly tipped with 

 tawny-olive; scapulars similar to the interscapulars but much more ex- 

 tensively banded and vermiculated with tawny-olive to buckthorn brown 

 and each feather Avith a conspicuous, large, median, terminal, white 

 elongated spot ; innermost secondaries like the scapulars ; primaries and 

 outer secondaries and upper wing coverts as in P- p. caurus; back, lower 

 back, rump, and upper tail coverts as in P. p. caurus but the dark mummy

Adult. — Similar to the corresponding sex (and season) of P- p. caurus 

 but paler above the brownish black areas reduced and more hidden, the 

 buffy-brown areas larger, paler — ^buckthorn brown, giving the bird the 

 appearance of a brown bird mottled with blackish, rather than a pre- 

 dominantly blackish bird mottled with brownish; the brown margins of 

 the breast feathers paler — tawny drab, the tarsal plumes relatively shorter, 

 and the chin and upper throat usually without dusky spots. Very worn 

 late spring and early summer birds are very m,uch more grayish above, 

 the buckthorn brown fading to smoke gray with an ochraceous wash. 



Juvenal. — Similar to that of P. p. caurus but with the brownish areas 

 above paler and more grayish — very pale Saccardo's umber, and the 

 top of the head less rufescent — deep ochraceous-tawny (instead of hazel). 



Downy young. — Similar to that of P. p. caurus but slightly more ex- 

 tensively tinged with ochraceous-buff above. 



Adult inale.— Wing 199^223 (210.3); tail 111-135 (119.7); culmen 

 from anterior end of nostril 10.9-13.1 (12.1); tarsus 41.1-46 (43.8);

 length of wing; third to fifth primaries longest, the first (outermost) 

 nearly equal to, sometimes longer than, seventh; outer primary moder- 

 ately bowed or incurved, the four or five outer ones distinctly emarginate

 truncate tips. Tarsus one-fifth to considerably more than one-fifth as 

 long as wing, completely clothed in winter with soft hairlike feathers ex- 

 cept on heel and part of planta tarsi, in summer with short feathers only 

 on acrotarsium, the planta tarsi covered with small and rather indistinct 

 roundish and hexagonal scales; middle toe slightly shorter to about as 

 long as tarsus; lateral toes about equal, reaching to about penultimate 

 articulation of middle toe ; hallux about as long as second phalanx of mid-

 grayish brown (darker distally) narrowly tipped with whitish or buffy 

 (narrowly barred with buffy in females) ; underparts pale buffy or whitish, 

 barred, more or less broadly, with grayish brown ; the under side of head 

 buffy with a cluster of grayish brown spots or bars on posterior portion 

 of malar region. 



Range. — Open districts of eastern North America, from western por- 

 tion of the Great Plains to the Atlantic coast (locally) and from Texas 

 and southwestern Louisiana (formerly also Virginia?) northward to 

 coast of Massachusetts, southwestern Ontario, southern Manitoba, and 

 southwestern Saskatchewan. (Two species.)

TYMPANUCHUS CUPIDO PINNATUS (Brewster) 



Greater Prairie Hen 



Adults. — Similar to that of the corresponding sex of the nominate 

 race but differing in having no conspicuous bufFy-whitish terminal spots 

 on the scapulars; the pinnae or neck tufts are composed of more than 

 10 feathers and the feathers are less pointed more abruptly truncate in 

 shape; the general tone of the upper parts averages less rufescent, the 

 broad tips of the feathers of the back, rump, and upper tail coverts 

 especially are less rufescent than in T. c. cupido, being pinkish buflE (in- 

 stead of pale tawny-olive) , and the dark bars on the underparts are gen- 

 erally narrower, and the thighs paler, the whole underparts seeming more 

 whitish^^ iris raw umber; "comb" deep cadmium; gular sacs dark Indian 

 yellow tinged brownish and slightly veined with red ; toes dark brownish 

 ocher, back of tarsi and lower surface of toes bright ocher-yellow ; claws 

 blackish tipped with whitish on the outer claw only. 



First-winter plumage. — Not certainly separable from the same stage 

 of the nominate race. 



Juvenal. — Forehead, sides of crown, and occiput between russet and 

 Sudan brown; center of crown fuscous-blackish (formed by blackish 

 tips of the otherwise russet feathers, occiput speckled with blackish ; 

 hindneck pinkish buff to pale pinkish buff, the feathers edged with fuscous, 

 giving a streaked appearance to the area, the more lateral feathers with 

 the buff more whitish; scapulars and interscapulars as in the adult but 

 the pale bars paler — pinkish buff to cinnamon-buff and the feathers with 

 prominent white shaft streaks; upper wing coverts and primaries as in 

 the adult, the latter feathers somewhat more pointed; secondaries with 

 the pale bars restricted to their outer webs except on the innermost 

 feathers, the brown areas broader than in the adults and somewhat 

 freckled and vermiculated with blackish; back, lower back, rump, and 

 upper tail coverts as in adult but more rufescent, the pale tips cinnamon- 

 buff ; rectrices unlike the adult, fuscous to fuscous-black, crossed by seven 

 or eight narrow buffy-whitish to pale pinkish-buff bars and narrowly 

 tipped with the same, these bars largely restricted to the outer webs of 

 the lateral rectrices, the dark interspaces mottled with clay color the size 

 of the patches increasing distally^® ; lores, supraorbital, and supraauricular 

 band pale pinkish buff to whitish; malar stripe extending below the eye 

 to, and including, the auriculars, like the top of the head, mixed with 

 fuscous-black posterior to the front end of the eye; lower cheeks, chin, 



'° Occasionally erythristic specimens occur, but these do not constitute a "normal" 

 plumage. 



'"The rectricial pattern is the easiest character by which yoimg Tympamuchus 

 may be told from young Pedioecetes. In the latter, the median rectrices have longi- 

 tudmal pale median stripes.

and throat less ochraceous than in adult — pale pinkish buff to whitish; 

 feathers of breast whitish tinged with pale ochraceous-buff and trans- 

 versely spotted (the bars broken into spots) with Prout's brown to clove 

 brown, the spots tending to coalesce into bars on the more posterior 

 breast feathers ; sides and flanks pale ochraceous-buff heavily barred with 

 dark buffy brown to sepia ; abdomen and thighs whitish barred with buffy 

 brown to pale buffy brown, the bars faint and small on the middle of the 

 abdomen; under tail coverts white with transverse spots of dark buffy 

 brown. 



Downy young. — Similar to that of the nominate race but richer yellow 

 below — straw yellow, the breast washed with yellow ocher; the top of 

 head ochraceous-tawny (Isabella color in T. c. cupido), and lower back 

 and rump ochraceous-buff to ochraceous-tawny; the dark markings as in 

 the nominate race.

 41-44.6 (43) ; height of bill at base 10-12 (11.3 mm.).i8 



Range. — Resident in the prairie districts of the Mississippi Valley from 

 central Alberta (Edmonton; casually as far north as Lac la Biche), south- 

 ern Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba south through the Dakotas, 

 Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan and southern Ontario (Wallace- 

 burg) to southeastern Michigan, western and southern Indiana, north- 

 western Ohio, and (probably, formerly) western Kentucky in the east,^° 

 and through Nebraska and central Kansas to eastern Colorado (Barton 

 and Barr), southeastern Wyoming (Chugwater), and to Oklahoma 

 (where now largely gone) and to extreme northern Texas (Gainesville, 

 Cooke County, and Tascosa). 



Occasional in Montana (1 record^near Huntley); in winter to 

 Arkansas. While this form does migrate to some extent, the limits of 

 its winter range are largely contained within the breeding range ; it occurs 

 casually in winter in northern Louisiana. 



Type locality. — Vermillion, S. Dak.

TYMPANUCHUS CUPIDO ATTWATERI Bendlre 



Louisiana Prairie Hen 



Adult. — Similar to that of the corresponding sex and wear of T. c. 

 pinnatus but smaller, darker in general coloration, tawnier above, usually 

 with more pronounced cinnamon-rufous on the neck; light-colored spots 




218 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



on the upper wing coverts smaller and tawnier; tarsi longer and much 

 more scantily feathered; the feathers much shorter and never extending 

 down to the base of the toes, even in front, the posterior side of the tarsus 

 always (even in winter) with a broad exposed naked strip (much the 

 greater part of the tarsus naked in summer). From the nominate form 

 this race differs in lacking the conspicuous pale terminal spots on the 

 scapulars, in having the pinnae composed of more than 10 feathers which 

 are abruptly truncated and not pointed, and in having the ventral bars 

 somewhat narrower (but nearer to T. c. cupido than to T. c. pinnaUis 

 in this respect) and considerably paler- — drab to pale bufiy brown, and 

 in having the upper breast washed with cinnamon to cinnamon-rufous. 



Juvenal. — None seen. 



Downy young. — Not certainly distinguishable from that of T. c. pin- 

 natus but apparently very slightly darker in its general tone above. 



Adult male.—Wing 202-213 (209) ; tail 84-90 (87.5) ; exposed culmen 

 18-21 (19.5) ; tarsus 50-52 (51) ; middle toe without claw 44-46 (44.7) ; 

 height of bill at base 11-12.5 (12.0 mm.).2o 



Adult female.— Wing 195-206 (202); tail 78-83 (80.8); exposed 

 culmen 17-20 (18.2) ; tarsus 47-50 (49) ; middle toe without claw 42-46 

 (43.4) ; height of bill at base 11-11.5 (11.2 mm.). 21 



Range. — Resident in the coastal prairies of southwestern Louisiana (a 

 small area in the western parts of Cameron and Calcasieu Parishes; 

 formerly east of Bayon Teche, Opelousas, and Abbeville) and in coastal 

 Texas (north to Austin, where now scarce; Refugio, Aransas, and Jeffer- 

 son Counties; to within 30 miles of the Rio Grande — Miradores Ranch).

 darker bars of the back and rump divided, containing a continuous brown 

 bar enclosed between two narrower blackish ones ; the feathers of the 

 breast with four to six alternate bars of brown and white ; the darker bars 

 of the sides and flanks bicolored — the broader light brown bar being 

 enclosed between two narrower dusky ones; forehead and anterior part 

 of crown pale cartridge buff, the feathers mummy brown on their con- 

 cealed basal portions ; rest of crown feathers dark mummy brown broadly 

 tipped with cartridge buff to light ochraceous-buff and subterminally 

 banded with light ochraceous-salmon and still more basally spotted with 

 the same ; occiput and nape similar but with the dark mummy brown areas 

 reduced to narrow bars, the tips more strongly ochraceous ; interscapulars, 

 back, lower back, rump, and upper tail coverts buffy brown to pale olive- 

 brown narrowly banded with pinkish buff to cinnamon-buff and with 

 dark clove brown to fuscous-black, the subterminal fuscous-black bars 

 divided lengthwise to include a continuous pale olive-brown to pale 

 cinnamon-buffy band bordered by narrower fuscous-black ones ; the tips 

 of these feathers becoming somewhat more grayish on the lower rump 

 and upper tail coverts; scapulars, lesser upper wing coverts, and sec- 

 ondaries tawny-olive to olive-brown barred with pinkish buff to whitish,

 ochraceous-tawny showing much more on the lower throat than on the 

 sides of the neck; pinnae composed mostly of black, abruptly truncated 

 feathers, a few of the lateral ones with various widths of buffy-white shaft 

 stripes, these pale areas edged with ochraceous-buffy and these feathers 

 with considerable ochraceous-tawny basally, their upper coverts, largely 

 ochraceous-tawny and buffy white; breast, upper abdomen, sides, and 

 flanks, whitish, each feather crossed by several fairly narrow bars of 

 buffy brown to olive-brown, these bars becoming broader and darker on 

 the sides and flanks, where they are bicolored, paler in the middle and 

 darker on the margins; middle and lower abdomen with the dark bars 

 greatly reduced in breadth and darkness or wanting; under tail coverts 

 clove brown very broadly tipped with ochraceous-tawny on their inner 

 webs ; under wing coverts whitish, the outer ones terminally spotted with 

 drab to pale buffy brown, bill dark brown ; iris brown, gular sacs, yellow 

 in the breeding season; toes yellowish, claws brownish black.^^

Alectoropode galline birds writh postacetabular region only moderately 

 broad; hypocleideum oval in contour; tarsometatarsus more than half 

 as long as tibia; tarsus never wholly feathered (rarely with upperpart 

 feathered), the planta tarsi frequently spurred (spurs 1-5) ; toes never 

 pectinated or feathered; nasal fossae wholly unfeathered (except, some- 

 times, a narrow strip along lower posterior margin) ; neck never with 

 inflatable air sacs and mandibular tomium not serrated or toothed (except 

 in subfamily Odontophorinae) . 



The Phasianidae comprise so many types of such diverse form that 

 it is difficult to frame a more detailed diagnosis of the group than that 

 given above. The group comprises over SO genera and between 250 

 and 300 species and subspecies, ranging in size from the peacocks, the 

 males of vi^hich are 6 to nearly 7 feet long (including the long "train"), 

 to the diminutive quails, some of which are less than 6 inches in total 

 length. Some, as the true pheasants, the monals or Impeyan pheasants, 

 and the peacocks, are among the most magnificent of birds, the brilliant 

 and varied coloration of the males rivaling even that of the humming- 

 birds and birds-of-paradise ; while many other groups are composed of 

 species as plainly colored as it is possible for birds to be. 



With so great a number of excessively diverse forms, it is exceedingly 

 difficult to classify the genera satisfactorily into trenchant subfamily and 




232 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



Other groups. No attempt will be made here, since so few of the genera 

 have any relation to the scope of the present work. It may, however, 

 be of interest to define, roughly, the major groups into which the family 

 may, for convenience, be divided, although some of these, at least, may be 

 purely artificial groups: 



(1) Phasianinae (the true pheasants). These exquisite game birds 

 are characterized by a vaulted^^ arid greatly elongated and graduated 

 tail, the adult males being brilliant, more or less metallic colors, softened 

 and relieved by other hues in elegant pattern. The typical genus is 

 Phasianus (whence the English name pheasant and French faisan), of 

 which the so-called English pheasant (P. colchicus) is a more or less 

 familiar example ; but the group includes besides several other genera, as 

 Chrysolophus, including the golden pheasant (C. pictits) and Lad} Am- 

 herst pheasant (C amherstiae) ; Gennaeus, represented by the silver 

 pheasant (G. nycthemerus) and more than half a dozen other species. 

 The subfamily Phasianinae may be divided into several subgroups : 



(a) Gallinae (the junglefowls). This group is composed of several 

 species of the genus Gallus, from one or more of which, but chiefly from 

 one (G. jerrnginexis) , have been derived, by artificial selection, all the 

 varieties or "breeds" of our domestic fowls. They differ from the pheas- 

 ants in having the tail more arched (or sickle-shaped) and in the 

 possession of a fleshy ''comb" and wattles. The common or Bankiva 

 junglefowl (G. ferruginous) is very similar to the ordinary red gamecock 

 and is undoubtedly the wild stock from which the latter and related 

 domestic breeds have been derived. It is a native of parts of India, Burma, 

 Assam, and the Malay countries, though to what extent its original range 

 has been extended by artificial means cannot now be ascertained. 



(b) LoPHOPHOREAE (the Impeyan pheasants, or monals, and the trago- 

 pans, or horned pheasants). This group comprises the genera Pucrasia 

 (Pucrus or Koklass pheasants), Ceriornis (tragopans), and Lophophorus 

 (Impeyan pheasants, or monals). They are heavy-bodied birds, with 

 comparatively short, rounded or slightly cuneate tails, all the feathers 

 of which lie in the same plane, like those of the various kinds of grouse 

 and most other birds, instead of being vaulted as in the true pheasaiits 

 and junglefowl. The tragopans have fleshy wattles, hornlike protuber- 

 ances, or other appendages about the head, and their plumage is character- 

 ized by variety and beauty of pattern, rather than brilliancy of colors. 

 There are about five species, found in the mountainous parts of India 

 and China. The monals, or Impeyan pheasants, are birds of about the 

 same size and general form as the tragopans (the males weighing about 

 A%. to 5 pounds). They have no wattles or other fleshy appendages about 



' A-shaped in transverse section. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 233 



the head, which, however, is ornamented -in males of at least two species 

 by a hawthorn crest, and the plumage is brilliant almost beyond comparison. 

 "It is difficult by means of a written description to give any idea of the 

 magnificent appearance of these brilliant birds to anyone who has not 

 seen them. Their metallic hues of fiery red, green, purple, and gold 

 vie in beauty and in their iridescent quality with the brightest of those 

 seen among the hummingbirds, and if one could imagine one of these 

 small flying gems increased to the size of a fowl, something of the ap- 

 pearance of these monauls might be conveyed to the mind." 



These birds inhabit the Himalayan Mountains, always near the snow- 

 line, and in summer ascend to elevations of 14,000 to 16,000 feet above 

 sea level. Being thus inured to great cold, it is probable that these 

 splendid birds would thrive and increase if liberated on our higher western 

 mountains. 



(c) PoLYPLECTRONEAE (the pcacock-pheasants) . This group includes 

 a single genus (Polyplectron) comprising- six or seven species, inhabit- 

 ing India, Burma, Cochin China, the Malay Peninsula, etc. They are 

 rather small size and are characterized by the presence of two or more 

 spurs on each leg and a broad, fan-Shaped tail ornamented by large eye- 

 like spots of metallic green, blue, or purple, the upper tail coverts and 

 wing coverts having similar markings. Some of the species are crested. 



(d) Pavoneae (the' peacocks). This group also includes a single 

 genus (Pwvo), but with only two, possibly three, species. The common 

 peacock (P. cristatus) , being domesticated; is too well known to require 

 description. It is a native of India and Ceylon. The Javan peacock 

 (P. muticus) is similar in size and form and, to a certain degree, in 

 coloration, but has the neck and underpartsi, green instead of .blue and 

 the crest quite different, the feathers composing it being fully webbed. 

 It inhabits Burma, Ceylon, and some of the Malay countries as well 

 as Java. 



(e) Argusianae (the argus pheasants). This group contains two 

 ; remarkable genera, one of only two or three species, the other monotypic. 



The well-known argus pheasant (Argusianus argus), the adult male 

 of which is 6 feet long (including the greatly elongated middle rectrices), 

 is distinguished by the enormous development, both in length and breadth, 

 of the secondary remiges, which are ornamented by exquisitely shaded 

 eyelike spots or ocelli, while the middle rectrices are also enormously 

 developed. The colors are not brilliant, consisting wholly of various hues 

 and tones of brown and gray, with minor markings of black, but the 

 exquisite shadings and pencilings, especially those on the secondaries, 

 produce an effect that is the envy of eveiy artist. This remarkable bird 

 is a native of the ' Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra, while the closely 

 related A. grayi inhabits Borneo. A third species, whose native country 

 is as yet a mystery, is known only from a single primary quill feather. 




234 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



A second genus of the group, Rheinardia, contains a single species 

 {R. ocellata). This, which inhabits the interior of Tonkin, is much 

 Hke Argusianus in form, having equally elongated middle rectrices (the 

 adult male measuring about seven feet in total length), but the secondaries 

 are much less developed, being but little if any longer than the primaries, 

 and the coloration quite different. 



(2) Perdicinae (the Old World quails). This group contains rela- 

 tively plain-colored birds of small to medium size, with the bill relatively 

 shorter and stouter, the maxilla deeper and narrower (transversely) and 

 its tip less produced, than in most true pheasants. 



(3) Odontophorinae (New World quails). Galliform birds of small 

 to medium size (wing 95-165 mm.) with the mandibular tomia ser- 

 rated or toothed subterminally. This group agrees in other characters 

 with the other members of the family, especially the Perdicinae, which 

 it represents in the Western Hemisphere. Besides the presence of the 

 serrations of the cutting edge of the mandible, possessed by all its members 

 and by none of the other groups of the family, the Odontophorinae have 

 the bill still stouter and shorter. None of them have spurs, though many 

 of the Perdicinae also do not. Additional characters are as follows : Tail 

 less than half as long as to slightly longer than wings, the rectrices ( 10- 

 14) never acuminate; tarsus less than one-fourth to more than one-third 

 as long as wing, the acrotarsium with a single row of broad, transverse 

 scutella, the planta tarsi with two or (usually) more definite rows of 

 moderately long scutella but partly covered with small scales. 



The remaining members of the Phasianidae, comprising about 26 genera 

 and more than 175 species and subspecies, are not so easily classified. 

 Some of them are more or less nearly allied to one or another of the 

 groups described above ; but much the greater number are very different, 

 including the various partridges, francolins, and spurfowl, for the most 

 part rather plainly colored birds of small to very small size. These may 

 well be dismissed, in this connection, without further mention, since the 

 present work has to do directly only with the few forms introduced into 

 North America with the view to their naturalization. 



The Phasiani are peculiar to Asia, including the outlying islands of 

 the Malay Archipelago, Japan, and Formosa. One species at present 

 occurs in Europe but is generally supposed, on the evidence of "what 

 passes for history, "^^ to have been introduced from western Asia into 

 continental Europe by the Argonauts, and into the British Islands by the 

 Romans. This, the so-called English pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), 

 has been introduced into the United States and is already naturalized 

 locally, while several other very beautiful species have been introduced 

 into Oregon, Washington, and other parts of the Far West, with more

or less success. Several of the smaller and less ornamental species have 

 also been introduced but, for the most part at least, with unsatisfactory 

 results. 



The following "key" to the genera includes only those that are native 

 to our region or that have been introduced into North America. One 

 of the genera is known only in a domesticated state as far as our region 

 is concerned and therefore will not be further noticed in this work.

DENDRORTYX MACROURA STRIATUS Nelson 



GuEwtERO Long-tailed Partkidge 



Adult. — Similar to that of the nominate race but with the crest feathers 

 more extensively black, only narrowly tipped with hazel, the back and 

 rump more olive brownish, less gray-brown, and with little or no trans- 

 verse whitish and blackish flecking; the hazel shaft stripes longer and 

 more pronounced on the feathers of the sides and extending posteriorly 

 to include the feathers of flanks. This is the most variable of all the 

 forms of the species (possibly it only seems so because of the far more 

 extensive material of it available) ; thus two males from the same place 

 and date present the two extremes. In one the sides and flanks and 

 lower abdomen are pale buffy brown, in the other dark olive-brown; 

 in the former the middle of the abdomen is very pale light drab, in the 

 latter hair brown to pale olive-brown; in the former the lateral portions 

 of the brea*t feathers are very pale light drab with a grayish tinge, in 

 the latter light mouse gray; "bill and feet bright yellowish scarlet" 

 (Goodknight).

 throat, and underpart of the body cream buff, brightest on the chin and 

 throat and becoming tinged with tawny-olive on the sides and flanks 

 which merge into the Brussels brown of the back ; thighs pale Brussels 

 brown ; bill and feet yellowish ( in dried skins ) .

DENDRORTYX LEUCOPHRYS NICARAGUAE Miller and Griscom 



Nicaraguan Long-tailed Partridge 



Adult. — Similar to that of the nominate race but with the abdomen, 

 sides, and flanks less huffy brown, more grayish ; the gray of the margins 

 of the feathers of the breast somewhat darker pale gray to dark gull 

 gray ; the russet to bay centers of the feathers of the lower throat, breast, 

 and the paler ochraceous-tawny ones of the abdomen, sides, and flanks, 

 reduced in size and duller in color, those of the lower throat and breast 

 occasionally tinged and edged with blackish; ground color of the back, 

 rump, and upper tail coverts darker, less greenish olive, more brownish; 

 and auriculars dark sooty gray, occasionally tinged with brownish ; "iris, 

 grayish olive or yellowish hazel; bill, black; bare skin of ocular area, 

 bright red, lower eyelid, flesh color; tarsi and feet, dull, brownish red 

 or dark orange-red ; feet slightly darker. These slight differences do not 

 seem to be correlated with sex or season."*^ 



First "winter" plumage. — ^Very similar to that of the adult but with 

 the upper throat streaked with sooty and the dark dull sepia of the crown 

 extending forward over the eyes and to the base of the culmen leaving 

 only a large loreal and supraloreal buffy whitish area on each side; the

 brown with narrow whitish shaft streaks which broaden out terminally 

 into triangular spots, the whitish shafts edged laterally with clove brown, 

 which extends out laterally as incomplete bars of the same; upper wing 

 coverts similar but with dusky clove brown shafts, the greater coverts 

 tipped with buffy white, edged with blackish proximally; scapulars and 

 secondaries bright tawny-olive to bright dark ochraceous-tawny heavily 

 mottled with clove brown and irregularly and incompletely barred with 

 pale cinnamon-buff; primaries as in adults but more pointed terminally;

 but abundantly barred with Saccardo's umber ; all the rectrices snuff brown 

 barred with cinnamon, each of the cinnamon bars broadly edged on both 

 sides with blackish ; chin and upper throat pale cream buff but the feathers 

 with dusky shaft streaks ; lower throat, breast, abdomen, sides, and flanks 

 dark hair brown to pale sepia, the feathers with distally spreading 

 triangular terminal spots of white or cinnamon-buff, terminally edged

" Twelve specimens from Honduras, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. 



■" Birds from the Pacific Cordillera of Guatemala and from El Salvador are 

 intermediate between this form and the nominate race. I have seen specimens from 

 the former area that are clearly nicaraguae and others from El Salvador that are 

 just as clearly leucophrys. Inasmuch as the bulk are nearer to nicaraguae I put 

 them all in this form.

Figure 17. — Philortyx fasciatus. 



Bill relatively rather small, the chord of culmen (from extreme base) 

 less than half as long as tarsus; depth of bill at base slightly exceeding 

 distance from anterior end of nasal fossa to tip of maxilla and decidedly 

 greater than width at rictus. Outermost primary nearly as long as sixth 

 (from outside), the third and fourth longest. Tail nearly two-thirds as 

 long as wing, strongly rounded, its graduation equal to about half the 

 length of tarsus, the rectrices (12) firm, rather broad, obliquely rounded 

 or subtruncate at tips. Tarsus less than one-third as long as wing, shorter 

 than middle toe with claw, the outer side of planta tarsi mostly covered 

 by a continuous series of obliquely transverse scutella, the inner side with

similar but less oblique scutella — both with smaller scutella of longitudinal 

 tendency next to margins of acrotarsium. 



Plumage and coloration. — A distinct elongated crest of several rather 

 narrow parallel-edged nearly straight flat plumes springing from center 

 of vertex. Scapulars and tertials spotted with black and tipped with buff ; 

 sides and flanks banded with white and brownish black, the breast and 

 chest more narrowly banded or barred. Sexes alike in color.

 arises a crest of fairly long, truncated, fuscous-black feathers tipped with 

 bright tawny-olive; feathers of hindneck and lower sides of neck, and 

 the anterior interscapulars, mouse gray, tipped with tawny-olive, the tips 

 broader on the neck than on the interscapulars, and, in the former area, 

 largely hiding the gray areas in the overlapping feathers ; posterior inter- 

 scapulars, back, and rump feathers dark mouse gray narrowly tipped 

 with pale tawny-white, many of them, especially in the upper back, sub- 

 terminally blotched with fuscous-black; scapulars, upper wing coverts, 

 and innermost secondaries grayish Saccardo's umber, tipped and crossed 

 by fine tawny-white to white bars and heavily blotched with fuscous-black 

 subterminally on both webs (in some feathers the blotches on the two 

 webs are coalesced; in others they are separate); secondaries between 

 grayish Saccardo's umber and olive-brown crossed by incomplete marginal 

 fine bars of tawny-white to white ; primaries dull olive-brown, some of the 

 outer webs with faint indications of marginal spots of paler; upper tail 

 coverts like the rump but finely speckled and vermiculated with dull tawny- 

 olive tinged with gray, the longer ones crossed sparingly by indistinct 

 fine whitish bars, and slightly blotched with fuscous-black subterminally ; 

 rectrices dusky grayish Saccardo's umber tipped and crossed by six or 

 more wavy whitish bands each of which is proximally bordered by a 

 slightly broader one of blackish, the umber interspaces finely speckled 

 with dusky; lores, cheeks, auriculars, and sides of throat dusky Sac- 

 cardo's umber ; chin and throat whitish ; upper breast feathers light mouse 

 gray broadly tipped with tawny-olive, the more posterior ones similar 

 but blotched with fuscous-blackish succeeded by a white subterminal band 

 separating the blackish from the brownish tips ; feathers of upper abdomen, 

 sides, and flanks white banded heavily with fuscous to fuscous-black, 

 the width of the blackish bands and tips increasing posteriorly; middle 

 of abdomen, and vent white, more or less tinged with bufify ; thighs sim- 

 ilar but tawnier ; under tail coverts buffy white, each with a large median,

 sides and back of neck, interscapulars, upper back, upper wing coverts, 

 and secondaries with narrow white or buffy-white shaft streaks and with 

 the rest of the feathers tawnier, the pale cross bars pale tawny-olive and 

 pale antique brown, the interspaces bright tawny-olive; rump, upper tail

 Callipepla Reichenow, Die Vogel, i, 1913, 317, part. 



Medium-sized Odontophorinae (wing about 108-120 mm.) with tail 

 more than three-fourths as long as wing, 12 rectrices, crest long, club- 

 shaped, consisting of several plumes with webs convolute, the uppermost 

 plume thus enclosing those beneath; chest plain grayish (not squamated), 

 and sexes conspicuously different in coloration. 



Bill relatively small, the chord of culmen (from extreme base) less 

 than half as long as tarsus, its depth at base not greater than distance 

 from anterior end of nasal fossa to tip of maxilla, and about equal to its 

 width at rictus. Outermost primary shorter than eighth (shorter than 

 ninth in L. douglasii), the fourth, fifth, and sixth or fourth (in L. doiig- 

 lasii) longest. Tail three-fourths as long as wing or more, graduated, the 

 graduation equal to two-thirds the length of tarsus or more; rectrices 

 (12) rather broad, slightly tapering terminally (except in L. douglasii), 

 with rounded tips. Tarsus decidedly less than one-third as long as wing 

 (about one-fourth as long in L. douglasii), shorter than middle toe with 

 claw, the planta tarsi covered mostly with rather small hexagonal scutella 

 but those near posterior edge of outer side larger, more transverse, and 

 tending to form a continuous linear series. 



Plumage and coloration. — Feathers of forehead narrow, erectile, some- 

 what bristlelilce ; springing from center of crown a conspicuous elongated 

 club-shaped crest comprised of several plumes with conduplicate webs 

 narrower basally, broader terminally (in L. californica and L. gambelii) 

 or in middle portion (in L. douglasii), the uppermost plume folding over 

 or enclosing anteriorly and laterally the other plumes. Scaptllars, tertials, 

 rump, etc., unspotted, but inner webs of tertials edged with buff or white ; 

 chest plain gray. Sexes conspicuously different in coloration.

California Quail 



Adult. — Similar to the corresponding sex of the nominate race but 

 darker, the upperparts much browner, the back and upper surface of 

 the wings olive-brown to almost Dresden brown in fresh plumage; the 

 breast in the male slightly deeper and more slate colored; in the female 

 the breast is more olive-brownish, less grayish than in the typical form. 



Juvenal. — Similar to that of the nominate race but with the upper- 

 parts more suffused with tawny-olive, the lower parts with an ochraceous 

 wash, and the dark markings averaging greater in size both above and 

 below. 



Natal down. — Similar to that of the typical form. 



Adult male.— Wing 108-119 (113.6) ; tail 85-94 (88.9) ; culmen from 

 base 14.8-16.5 (15.7) ; tarsus 30-34 (32.4) ; middle toe without claw 26.5- 

 30.5 (27.9 mm.). ^3 



Adidt female.— Wing 106-113 (110); tail 79.5-88 (83.5); culmen 

 from base 14.5-16 (15.2); tarsus 29-34.5 (31.4); middle toe without 

 claw 26-29.5 (27.4 mm.)." 



i?an^^.— Resident in the humid coastal area of California from the 

 northern border south to Santa Cruz County. Often recorded in literature 

 as extending north to southwestern Oregon, but no specimens of this 

 form have ever been taken there.''* 



Introduced into Hawaii, New Zealand, Chile, and locally in western 

 United States (Washington, Colorado, etc.) and Vancouver Island, 

 Canada.

 but one of the two forms available. In such cases, geography must be used as a 

 guide.

 thirds, this color often showing through as spots, and many of the 

 occipital feathers laterally, but not terminally, edged with pale buffy

 their median portion russet to chestnut, separated by a blackish line 

 on each web from the broad lateral white edgings, the more lateral nape 

 feathers tending to have broader white marks on their outer than on 

 their inner webs; interscapulars and upper back Mikado brown to Ver- 

 ona brown edged and clouded with light drab to smoke gray, and later- 

 ally incompletely barred with blackish, the more posterior feathers fre-

 across the lower throat, followed posteriorly by a broader one of cin- 

 namon to sayal brown; this bsind is fairly uniform in some birds while 

 in others it is broken to the extent of being little more than a series 

 of brownish lateral segments of white centered feathers; the posterior 

 feathers comprising this band are narrowly tipped with black and are 

 subterminally white; upper abdomen white washed with pale warm 

 buff, the feathers crossed by 4 or 5 narrow black bars; lower abdomen 

 without the buffy wash and with the blackish bars fewer or absent;

 coronal feathers with largely concealed black median areas, the occipital 

 ones with buffy edges; the postdcular area, including the auriculars, like 

 the crown ; the posterior border of the upper throat very narrowly fus-

 sepia to fuscous, the rest of the feather sometimes indistinctly banded 

 with pale ochraceous-tawny ; feathers of middle of lower back Saccardo's 

 umber with very large subterminal blotches of deep fuscous, the umber 

 often merely forming a narrow edge; rest of back, rump, and upper tail 

 coverts dull wood brown indistinctly mottled transversely with dusky, 

 the upper tail coverts being more distinctly barred ; wings practically 

 as in adults but all the primaries more pointed; rectrices as in adult but 

 the median ones with the freckling more definitely arranged into bars; 

 lores, cheeks, and auriculars like the crown; chin and upper throat 

 dirty white, the breast dull light vinaceous-cinnamon with a grayish wash ;

COLINUS VIRGINIANUS TEXANUS (Lawrence) 



Texas Bobwhite 



Adult male.- — Similar to that of the nominate form but without any 

 black loreal band from the bill to the eye and without large, conspicuous 

 black blotches on the scapulars, innermost secondaries, and back; gen- 

 erally much more grayish, less rufescent above, and less tinged with ochra- 

 ceous or buffy below ; the feathers of upperparts of head and body paler 

 in their brownish parts than in the typical form and each feather termi- 

 nally edged with pale smoke grayish, the interscapulars and feathers of 

 the .back and upper wing coverts barred with whitish each of these bars 

 bordered by blackish ; the black border posterior to the white throat nar- 

 rower; size generally smaller. 



Adult female. — Similar to that of the nominate race but slightly paler 

 and much grayer, as in the male, and without large black blotches on the 

 scapulars, inner secondaries, and back. 



Immature. — Similar to the adult of corresponding sex, but with the 

 two outer primaries more pointed terminally. 



Juvenal. — Like that of the nominate race of corresponding sex but 

 somewhat paler, and, for this reason, appearing somewhat more brownish, 

 less dusky. 



Natal down. — Not distinguishable from that of the typical race.

' According to persons who have been in Key West, there is reason to question 

 whether there ever was any country there suitable for bobwhites. This would make 

 the present form seem more likely to have been based on a stray, small example 

 of the south Floridian race. For this reason, and alsp since, being extinct and known 

 from only a single example, material of it is not apt to be forthcoming for identi- 

 fication, it might well be looked upon as not distinct from C. v. floridanus. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 329 



COLINUS VIRGINIANUS CUBANENSIS (Gray) 



Cuban Boewhite 



Adult male. — Similar to that of the nominate race but much darker 

 and more reddish, the black gular collar very much broader, the entire 

 Upper and lateral parts of the abdomen between hazel and ochraceous- 

 tawny, the feathers margined with black (the black broken with white 

 patches on the feathers of the sides) and not transversely barred with 

 black as in the typical subspecies (except in examples with mixed blood 

 due to the introduction of birds from the North American mainland) ; 

 anterior upperparts with less grayish and more deep tawny russet than 

 in the nominate race ; posterior upperparts with no rufescent, all grayish ; 

 the grayish edgings of the interscapulars and upper back darker — deep 

 mouse gray, the black blotches on the wings and lower back much larger ; 

 the black feather edgings on the interscapulars nape much broader, forming 

 almost a black collar across that area. 



Adult jemale. — Very similar to that of the Texas race Colinus virgin- 

 ianus texanus but darker, the blackish blotches, edges, and bars broader 

 and thereby appearing darker, the ground color of the upperparts more 

 grayish, less rufescent ; the broad superciHaries, the chin and upper throat 

 averaging darker — ochraceous-buff with a slightly dusky tinge, and the 

 edges of the feathers of the crown more grayish than brownish.

COLINUS VIRGINIANUS SALVINI Nelson 



Salvin's Bobwhite 



Adult male. — The darkest of all the races of the species ; above very 

 similar to the male of Colinus virginianus insignis but darker, the head 

 with less rufescent, more solidly fuscous to fuscous-black, the rufescent 

 median areas of the interscapulars between dark hazel and Sanford's 

 brown; the blackish markings on the wings, back, rump, and upper tail' 

 coverts larger and less mixed with rufescent, the ground color of these 

 areas duskier ; entire head, chin, and throat dark fuscous to fuscous-black 

 with an interrupted, narrow, white postocular line on each side; the 

 feathers of the occiput and nape with narrow whitish edges ; the blackish ■ 

 brown of the throat extends over the entire breast, where the feathers 

 have narrow cinnamon to hazel shaft streaks ; abdomen, sides, and flanks 

 uniform hazel, vent and under tail coverts barred with black and white. 



Adult female. — Similar to that of C. v. insignis but generally darker, 

 more grayish, less brownish above, the interscapulars, back, lower back, 

 and rump deep hair brown edged with dusky smoke gray and subterminally 

 blotched very extensively with chaetura drab to chaetura black, the more 

 posterior parts with a considerable mixture of dark olive-brown ; the dark 

 markings on the underside heavier, darker, and more numerous. 



Other plumages apparently unknown.

COLINUS VIRGINIANUS NELSONI Brodkorb 



Nelson's Bobwhite 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Colinus virginianus salvini but with 

 the dark markings even darker, purer black, instead of brownish black, 

 although less extensive; the white markings also purer, less grayish, and 

 smaller in extent; rufescent markings brighter and more extensive; the 

 black of the chin and throat not extending over the breast, except as a few 

 of the pectoral feathers have blackish margins; some of the abdominal 

 feathers, especially the midventral ones, may also have narrow blackish 

 margins; thighs, vent, and under tail coverts almost pure bright hazel 

 with no or few blackish markings. From C. v. coyolcos it differs in hav- 

 ing more extensive and deeper black markings, deeper hazel markings, 

 and purer (less huffy) white markings, all of which are more in contrast 

 with each other; no white superciliaries ; the crown is entirely black in 

 two males, but has a brown patch on the occiput and nape in one example. 



Adult female. — Like that of C. v. salvini but with the black markings 

 smaller and the brown and buff markings more extensive. All the colors 

 are brighter, clearer, more sharply contrasted. From C. v. coyolcos it 

 differs in being darker and in having all the markings more sharply 

 contrasted. 



Other plumages apparently unknown.

COLINUS VIRGINIANUS THAYEKI Banes and Peters 



Thayer's Bodwhite 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Colinus virginianus coyolcos but with 

 the chin and throat, upper lores, forehead, and superciliaries white, the 

 throat sometimes streaked with black; above slightly paler and grayer, 

 less blotched and spotted. Similar also to the male of C. v. pectoralis but 

 with a broader black pectoral band, with less or no white at the base of 

 the feathers of this area.^' 



Adult female. — Very similar to, not certainly distinguishable from, that 

 of C. V. coyolcos. In very fresh plumage thayeri seems to have more 

 grayish on the upper back and interscapulars, but after even slight wear 

 this distinction disappears. 



Other plumages apparently unknown. 



Adult male.— Wing 97-101 (99.9) ; tail 48-55.5 (52.6) ; culmen from 

 base 14.8-16.2 (15.3) ; tarsus 27.6-30 (28.7) ; middle toe without claw

Adtilt female.— Wing 98-102.5 (100.1) ; tail 50-54 (52) ; culmen from 

 base 14.5-16.2 (15.2) ; tarsus 26.9-29.6 (28.2) ; middle toe without claw 

 23.8-25.3 (24.7 mm.). 29 



Range. — Resident in the dry country of inland eastern Oaxaca from 

 Chivela to Guichicovi and Tutla. 



Type locality. — Chivela, Oaxaca.

^'The status of thayeri and coyolcos is puzzling and cannot be settled with present 

 information. While the two groups are easily distinguished in the male plumage, 

 as noted in the description of coyolcos, two adult males from Huilotepec are more like 

 thayeri than like coyolcos, even though they come from the farthest side of the 

 range of the latter !

COLINUS VntGINIANUS ATEICEPS (OsilTie-Grant) 



Black-headed Bobwhite 



Adult male. — Similar to Colinus virginianus salvini but larger and paler, 

 the lower breast and abdomen with no blackish markings; the rufescent 

 color above more extensive. "Differs chiefly from the male of . . . coyolcos 

 in having the top of the head, superciliary stripe, chin, and throat all 

 uniform black without a trace of white, and the general color of both upper 

 and underparts darker" (e;r Ogilvie-Grant). 



Adult female. — ^"Differs from the female of . . . coyolcos in being 

 altogether darker, especially on the upper parts ; the gray markings of the 

 mantle in the latter . . . being replaced by brownish black" {ex Ogilvie-

 the sides of the head, at least the auriculars and sides of neck, rufescent ; 

 above, especially on the head, back, rump, and wings, paler, the blackish 

 markings much reduced and replaced largely by brown ; the interscapulars 

 paler hazel ; breast and abdomen also slightly paler. "Hind part of crown,

BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 345 



uniform black, with an indistinct series of small white streaks immediately 

 above the ear-coverts, suggestive of a postocular stripe. Upper back and 

 entire underparts light tawny-cinnamon, the latter absolutely uniform, 

 except on hinder flanks, and longer under tail-coverts, which are varied 

 with black and whitish, in the form of edgings and terminal spots of the 

 latter, the former as sub-edgings and V-shaped markings ; feathers of the 

 upper back varied by a blackish speckling along the edges. Lower back, 

 scapulars, wing-coverts, tertials, rump, and upper tail-coverts confusedly 

 mottled and vermiculated with brownish gray and blackish, the scapulars 

 and tertials suffused or stained with rusty brown; wing-coverts rather 

 broadly but irregularly barred with whitish, the inner webs of the latter 

 deeply indented with the same, forming an irregular or interrupted border ; 

 feathers of lower rump and upper tail-coverts with irregular 'herring-bone' 

 markings of blackish. Tail bluish gray, minutely mottled with whitish and

 grayish, more in contrast to the rest of the coloration of the feathers 

 involved ; top of head with the dusky median stripes to the feathers darker,, 

 the edges paler and huffier. "Upper parts essentially as in the adult male, 

 lores and sides of forehead pale bufif, this extending back to the nape in a 

 continuous, broad superciliary stripe ; chin, malar region, and entire throat 

 uniform pale buff, bordered behind by a narrow transverse chain or series 

 of black and rusty triangular spots. Chest pale cinnamon, slightly varied 

 with black and whitish ; rest of lower parts white, the sides and flanks 

 broadly striped with pale cinnamon, enclosed between U- or V-shaped 

 black markings, the breast and belly having sparse V-shaped bars of black ; 

 under tail-coverts pale cinnamon, broadly tipped with bufify whitish and 

 each ornamented by a subterminal V-shaped mark of black." (R. R.) 



Juvenal male. — Forehead, crown, and occiput mottled fuscous-black and 

 light ochraceous-bufT, the feathers having shafts, edges, and narrow tips 

 of the latter color ; interscapulars and upper wing coverts as in the adult 

 female, but with white shaft streaks terminally widening into small tri- 

 angular spots, and the feathers blotched with clove brown to dark chestnut- 

 brown; remiges as in the adult male; lower back, rump, and upper tail 

 coverts as in the adult female ; rectrices dusky sepia crossed by numerous 

 narrow wavy white bars each of which is proximally bordered with mummy

" It may be that the specimen on which this description is based, collected late in 

 October in Sonora (Conover coll. 92944), had already begun its postjuvenal molt, as 

 Allen (Auk, 1889, 189) described a young male in postjuvenal molt as having the 

 "throat . . . pure white, with new black feathers appearing irregularly along the sides 

 of the chin and upper throat . . ." It may be that in males in full juvenal plumage the 

 throat is not blackish as in the above account. If so, the sexes are alike in this stage.

 edged with pale ochraceous-buff and incompletely banded with the same 

 on their outer webs; primaries as in the male but their outer webs very 

 faintly flecked with pale ochraceous-buffy ; back, lower back, rump, and 

 tail coverts as in the male but browner, less grayish, and with the median 

 dark blotches smaller and less noticeable ; rectrices as in the male but all, 

 the lateral as well as the median ones, externally flecked transversely with 

 grayish white ; auriculars dark dull auburn ; feathers of sides of neck and 

 of the entire breast white with blackish-brown shaft stripes and cross bars 

 dividing the feathers into at least two rows of white spots terminally, the 

 feathers, especially those of the sides of the neck, pale dull hazel to ochra- 

 ceous-tawny basally ; feathers of abdomen white crossed by widely spaced 

 fuscous bars, the most distal of which is medially extended as a shaft

colinus CEISTATUS SONNINI (Temminck) 



SONNINI'S BoBWHITE 



Adult male. — Forehead, lores, and anterior part of crown varying from 

 buffy whitish to pale huffy brown or grayish brown ; the posterior coronal 

 area with the dusky basal parts of the feathers showing through occa- 

 sionally, giving a transversely marked appearance, crest darker — dull 

 sepia to fairly pale bister — the feathers edged with bufify brown to al- 

 most buckthorn brown; sides of crown and occiput edged with feathers 

 that are black on their inner webs, edged with bufify white, and light 

 ochraceous-tawny on their outer webs; broad superciliaries bright 

 ochraceous-tawny to ochraceous-orange ; feathers of nape streaked with 

 black; a nuchal collar of snuff -brown feathers with large subterminal 

 white spots edged with black; interscapulars and upper back cinnamon 

 coarsely vermiculated with black, each feather edged with mouse gray; 



" Three specimens, including the type. 

 "Four specimens. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 361 



scapulars and inner, greater, and median upper wing coverts between 

 Dresden brown and cinnamon-brown crossed by narrow, widely spaced 

 wavy bars of pale buflfy edged with dusky ; the scapulars internally mar- 

 gined with ochraceous-buff, the coverts completely edged with pale smoke 

 gray; innermost secondaries like the scapulars; rest of secondaries dull 

 sepia, edged and incompletely barred on their outer webs with light pink- 

 ish cinnamon and more or less suffused with Dresden brown on their 

 outer webs; primaries dull sepia faintly flecked on their outer margins 

 with ashy light pinkish cinnamon; rest of upper wing coverts Dresden 

 brown to cinnamon-brown externally edged narrowly with pale pinkish 

 buff; these edgings enlarged terminally into broader tips, the brown 

 areas faintly stippled and vermiculated with dusky; back, lower back, 

 rump, and upper tail coverts bright cinnamon-brown with a tawny tinge, 

 narrowly tipped and crossed by narrow, but widely spaced bars of pale 

 buffy, these bars proximally edged with blackish, which sometimes ex- 

 tends basally along the shaft for a short distance; rectrices similar but 

 less tawny ; chin and throat bright light ochraceous-tawny to ochraceous- 

 orange; auriculars dull, dark Dresden brown; a pectoral band of white 

 feathers with wedge-shaped black terminal spots; breast between tawny- 

 olive and clay color, the feathers tipped with a slightly paler and ashler 

 tone, and basally transversely marked with blackish (usually hidden by 

 the overlapping feathers), this color becoming more ochraceous on the 

 upper abdomen, where, however, the feathers have several large white 

 or buffy spots on each web with blackish transverse interspaces, the 

 brown restricted to the median part of the feathers, this median area 

 increasing in extent and brightness on the sides ; feathers of lower lateral 

 parts of the abdomen, the flanks, thighs, and under tail coverts with the 

 pale spots larger, huffier, the brownish or ochraceous areas much re- 

 duced, the black bars wider ; middle of lower abdomen pale bufly barred 

 with blackish ; under wing coverts pale sepia to wood brown flecked with 

 buffy white. 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male on the upper parts but generally 

 less ruf escent, more grayish sepia ; the superciliaries pale ashy buff, dark- 

 ening posteriorly ; the crown and crest darker — sepia with less ochraceous 

 edgings; the interscapulars and upper back duskier and without grayish 

 edges; below much less ruf escent than the male; chin and throat buffy 

 grayish white, suffused to a varying extent posterolateral^ with ochra- 

 ceous-tawny; breast and upper abdomen drab to pale sepia instead of 

 tawny-olive; abdomen largely white, the blackish markings averaging 

 somewhat smaller than in the male, the brownish areas reduced and largely 

 restricted to the more lateral feathers. ^^ 



'^ There seems to be considerable variation in the whiteness of the abdominal plu- 

 mage that may be correlated with age, the immature or subadult birds possibly 

 averaging more buffy than the older ones. More material is needed to determine this. 




362 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



Juvenal (?). — None seen, but one described by Ogilvie-Grant as "quite 

 young" is said to have "the upperparts very similar to those of the female 

 adult, but all the feathers of the mantle, wing-coverts, scapulars, and 

 chest have pale buff shaft-stripes ; chin and throat white, rest of the under- 

 parts white irregularly barred with black."

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 



365 



Large and stoutly built very short-tailed Odontophorinae (wing about 

 127-158 mm.) with short tail (less than half as long as wing), large 

 and stout feet (tarsus nearly one-third as long as wing, sometimes 

 slightly longer), heavy bill, more or less extensively naked orbital region, 

 and feather of posterior portion of pileum more or less (but not con- 

 spicuously) elongated, forming, when erected, a bushy crest of broad, 

 round-tipped, decurved or decumbent feathers ; sexes alike in coloration. 



Bill relatively large and heavy, the chord of exposed culmen (from 

 extreme base) equal to two-fifths to nearly half the length of tarsus, the 

 depth of bill at base greater than distance from anterior end of nasal 

 fossa to tip of maxilla and equal to or greater than its width at rictus; 

 culmen strongly convex, rounded, narrower and more ridge-like basally. 



Figure 20. — Odontophorus gujanensis. 



Outermost primary equal to or slightly shorter (sometimes much shorter) 

 than ninth (from outside), the third, fourth, and fifth, fourth, fifth and 

 sixth, or fifth to eighth longest. Tail two-fifths to nearly half as long 

 as wing, mostly concealed by coverts, the rectrices (12), however, firm, 

 broad, with rounded tips. Tarsus nearly one-third as long as wing, 

 sometimes more than one-third as long, nearly to quite as long as middle 

 toe with claw, very stout, the planta tarsi, on both sides, with a continuous 

 row of transverse scutella (larger and more continuous on outer side). 

 Plumage and coloration. — Feathers of pileum elongated, broad, soft, 

 and flattened (webs not conduplicate), forming, when erected, a bushy 

 crest; orbital (sometimes also loral) region more or less extensively 

 naked. Coloration dull, various tones of brown or brown and rufous

predominating, usually vermiculated with dusky, often more or less 

 speckled or barred with buffy, the scapulars sometimes spotted with black, 

 the outer webs of primaries often spotted with cinnamon- rufous or buffy. 

 Sexes alike in coloration or at least not conspicuously different.

"^ The Juvenal plumages of the two phases are still to be elucidated. The material 

 examined presents too many differences to be "normal" for color varieties. What 

 is needed is juvenal material collected with the parents to be certain of the 

 identification.

original designation, Ortyx thoracicus Gambel.) 

 Odontophorus Reichenow, Die Vogel, i, 1913, 316, part. 



Medium-sized, very short-tailed Odontophorinae (wing about 130-135 

 mm.) with outstretched tarsi extending beyond tip of tail, claws very 

 long, relatively slender, slightly curved, and blunt, those of lateral toes 

 extending much beyond middle of middle claw, tarsus more than one- 

 fourth as long as wing, rectrices firm, broad, rounded at tips, feather of 

 decumbent crest distinctly outlined, and sexes not conspicuously different 

 in coloration. 



Bill relatively rather small and slender, the chord of culmen (from 

 extreme base) equal to nearly half the length of tarsus ; the depth of bill 

 at base not exceeding distance from anterior end of nasal fossa to tip 

 of maxilla and a little less than width of bill of rictus; culmen rather 

 strongly convex, narrowly and rather distinctly ridged; gonys relatively 

 narrow but rounded transversely, straight or very nearly so, slightly 

 ascending terminally, its basal angle not prominent. Outermost primary 

 intermediate between seventh and eighth (from outside), the fourth and 

 fifth longest. Tail two-fifths as long as wing, moderately rounded, the 

 rectrices (12) rather firm, broad, and rounded at tips; very distinct from 

 coverts. Tarsus a little more than one-fourth as long as wing, shorter 

 than middle toe with claw, its lower end, when feet are outstretched, ex- 

 tending much beyond tip of tail ; planta tarsi with numerous rather large

 open country with coverage of grass, bushes, mescal, and small trees, at 

 elevations of from 4,000 to 9,000 feet, from westcentral Texas (Mason,

 (Zuni, San Mateo, White, and Guadalupe Mountains, etc.) ; and Arizona 

 (Fort Whipple, Camp Verde, Mogollon Ridge, Wilcox, Marsh Lake, 

 Huachuca and Whetstone Mountains, Catalina, and Chiricahua Moun- 

 tains) south to northern Nuevo Leon and northern Coahuila (Carmen 

 Mountains), northern Chihuahua (Jesus Maria and Caiiada) ; Sonora 

 (Los Pinitos, JLos Vengos, Guirocoba, Nacori, Huerachi, and Yacoera), 

 and northwestern Durango (Pasaje de las Mujeres).

" Bent, U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull. 162, 1932, 87, states that in this "plumage the sexes 

 are much alike, except that in the young male the crissum, lower belly, and flanks are 

 black, and the center of the breast is suffused with brown, whereas in the young 

 female these parts are white; these characters. are conspicuous in flight. . . ." The 

 material studied in the present connection does not bear this out ; I cannot help but 

 conclude that Bent was misled by birds in an advanced stage of the postjuvenal molt. 

 The true juvenal plumage is worn for a short time only before feathers of the first 

 winter (adult) plumage begin to appear, first on the breast, then on the abdomen. 



"^ Thirty-one specimens from Texas, New Mexico, Coahuila, Chihuahua, Sonora,

CYRTONYX MONTEZUMAE MEKRIAMI Nelson 



Merriam's Harlequin Quail 



Adult male. — Similar to that of the nominate form but with the crown 

 darker, the light shaft streaks of the back of the head bufly white, and 

 the black of the throat continuing posteriorly to the chestnut of the breast, 

 thereby eliminating any white pectoral band such as is found in the 

 other races of the species; sides of breast much lighter gray, more slaty, 

 with the white spots about half as large, the spots becoming golden buff 

 on the lower flanks and almost chestnut on the tips of the feathers ; chest- 

 nut of breast slightly paler; upper parts with the gray portions of the 

 feathers more slaty, the light shaft streaks buflfy on mantle, gradually 

 darkening until they are chestnut on the longer scapulars, innermost 

 secondaries, and upper tail coverts; the spots on the upper wing coverts 

 light golden. 



Inasmuch as this form is still known only from the type, we quote 

 here the original description in its entirety (Nelson, Auk, xiv, 1897, 48) : 

 "The general pattern of head markings of merriami is much as in monte- 

 zumae, except that the black chin and throat area extends down to the 

 chestnut on the lower neck and breast with no intervening white collar; 

 the white superciliary band which extends under the black throat patch 

 as a white collar in montezumae, ends on each side of the neck in mer- 

 riami. Bluish-black auricular patches extend forward on the sides of 

 neck and form a broad junction with the black of the throat. The crown 

 and crest are darker than in montezumae, the light shaft-streaks on the 

 back of the neck and shoulders are buffy whitish, becomitig more and 

 more intensely colored posteriorly, until on the longer scapulars and ter- 

 tiaries they are almost or quite chestnut; the webs of the tertiaries are 

 gray, becoming browner near the tips, and are crossed by several trans- 

 verse, oblong black spots which are much narrower and more like bars 

 than are the corresponding markings in montezumae ; the back and rump 

 are blackish with golden buffy shaft-lines, brown mottling and narrow 

 ashy edgings to the feathers ; the upper tail coverts are ashy with heavy 

 rusty shaft-lines and several transverse black bars on each web of the 

 feathers ; the chestnut area of the breast and belly is as in montezumae, 

 but is of a lighter shade; the sides of the breast and flanks are slaty 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 399 



gray, lighter than in the latter species and marked with numerous round 

 white spots about half the size of those in that bird. On the posterior 

 portion of the flanks the white spotting is replaced by spots of buffy and 

 chestnut. The rest of the lower parts are black as in mcmtezumae." 



Known only from the type locality, the eastern slopes of Mount Orizaba, 

 and probably (sight records only) from Antigua, nearer the coast, in 

 the State of Veracruz.

CYRTONYX MONTEZUMAE SALLEI Vcrreanx 



Salle's Harlequin Quail 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Cyrtonyx montezumae montezumae 

 above but more brownish, less blackish, upper wing coverts and scapulars 

 clear light grayish olive with heavy but widely spaced transverse black 

 spots; the shaft stripes of the interscapulars and upper back warm buflf, 

 those of the scapulars, upper wing coverts, rump, upper tail coverts, and 

 rectrices ochraceous-orange to ochraceous-tawny ; below differs from the 

 nominate race in having the brown median area of the breast and abdomen 

 paler — ^bright chestnut with a slight orange-tawny tinge; the feathers of 

 the sides of the breast and of the upper abdomen much paler — slate-gray 

 with smaller round white spots, the spots becoming chestnut on the 

 feathers of the sides of the lower abdomen, the most posterior of which 

 have chestnut stripes as well ; the dark area from the lores to the auriculars 

 and sides of throat paler, slate instead of blackish slate. 



Adult female. — Very similar to that of the nominate race but with the 

 upperparts averaging darker, the brown areas of the feathers Saccardo's 

 umber (as compared to tawny-olive in C. m. montezumae) and the black 

 cross marks more densely and abundantly developed, giving a general 

 impression of a blacker dorsum ; the breast and abdomen averaging slightly 

 darker vinaceous-fawn. 



Immature male. — This is not a true plumage, but in a bird of which 

 so little is known it is deemed advisable to include here the following

Long-legged Colin 



Adult male. — Similar to that of Rhynchortyx cinctus pudibundus, but 

 with less white on the lower abdomen, the tawny tones below averaging 

 darker — clay color to pale tawny-olive ; and the gray of the breast darker

 of this race, the color affecting the back, rump, and upper tail coverts. 

 One specimen from Tacarcuna has this area dark mouse gray finely pep- 

 pered with blackish and white, no rufescent being present except on the 

 tips of the upper tail coverts ; another from the same place is of the vina- 

 ceous fawn phase; while still another, from Mount Sapo, in the Pacific 

 slope of Darien, is of the buffy-brown phase. 



Adult female. — Similar to that of Rhynchortyx cinctus pudibundus but 

 with less white on the lower abdomen and averaging slightly darker and 

 more rufescent above (in the vinaceous-fawn-backed phase, the back is

 basal area more extended onto the chestnut, which is restricted to the 

 median part of the feathers, not reaching the edges of the webs, some- 

 what grayish terminally; other secondaries tawny-cinnamon crossed by 

 widely spaced triple bars, each bar consisting of two clove-brown to 

 fuscous ones with a pale pinkish buff in between these bars breaking 

 up on the inner webs of the inner secondaries into irregular mottlings ;

 tawny of the head more ferruginous and extending over the breast which 

 is heavily vermiculated with deep bay; the sides and flanks bay, the 

 dark brown abdominal spot much larger and deeper in color — dark bay. 



Adult female (winter plumage). — Like the corresponding male but 

 the tawny of the forehead, lores, cheeks, chin, and throat slightly paler 

 and pinker, less olive or tawny ; feathers of crown and occiput with darker 

 bases and with their subterminal pale shaft streaks terminally edged with 

 blackish, producing a more spotted appearance ; nape, interscapulars more 

 brownish, less grayish than in the male ; rest of upperparts more brownish, 

 less grayish than in the male and with more dark fuscous to fuscous- 

 black blotches showing (these basal areas of the feathers more extensive) 

 and with the subterminal dark sagittate band darker, deep chestnut to 

 bay; breast averaging somewhat huffier than in male; the middle of the 

 upper abdomen usually white with only a few broad chestnut tips on the 

 feathers, but also, in other specimens, a large chestnut patch almost as 

 extensive as in the male; wings as in male except that the median and 

 lesser upper coverts have buffy bars like the greater ones ; inner secondaries 

 and scapulars with less chestnut, the bases dark bister to fuscous with 

 widely spaced pale buffy bars. 



Adult female (summer plumage). — ^Like the winter plumage but with 

 the new feathers on the back and sides of the neck and the lower throat 

 with pale shaft streaks with tear-shaped spots margined with fuscous, 

 those on rest of upperparts brownish black narrowly tipped with buffy

 States (northwestern Kansas, Iowa, southeastern Wisconsin, Montana, 

 eastern Washington, and eastern Oregon). Introduced unsuccessfully 

 in the Eastern States from Maine and New York south to Florida and

distinctly crested ; orbital region partly feathered and malar region com- 

 pletely feathered; without an erectile nuchal "cape"; adult females with 

 middle pair of rectrices not conspicuously longer than next pair. 



Bill moderate in size, as deep as or deeper than wide at base of culmen, 

 the latter gradually but rather strongly decurved, the tip of maxilla pro- 

 duced distinctly beyond tip of mandible; maxillary tonium distinctly and

more or less regularly concave ; cere densely feathered beneath and behind 

 the nostril, the upper portion nude, the upper outline (mesorhinium) more 

 or less ascending basally and arched, the nostrils overhung by a large, 

 tumid operculum. Wing moderate, rounded, with primaries slightly to 

 much longer than longest secondaries ; fourth or fourth and fifth primaries 

 longest, the first (outermost) about equal to eighth. Tail decidedly longer 

 than wing (adult male), flat or very nearly so, excessively graduated, the 

 rectrices (18) tapering toward their acuminate or subacuminate tips. 

 Tarsus decidedly less than one-third as long as wing, rather stout, the 

 acrotarsium with two rows of broad transverse scutella (in contact with 

 each other along median line, the planta tarsi also with two rows, but that 

 on inner side composed of smaller scutella; planta tarsi with a conical 

 spur a little below middle, this rudimentary or obsolete in females ; middle 

 toe a little more than two-thirds as long as tarsus, the outer toe reaching 

 to middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe to sub- 

 terminal articulation of middle toe; hallux elevated, about as long as 

 basal phalanx of outer toe ; a distinct web between basal portion of anterior 

 toes; claws rather short, slightly curved, more or less blunt. 



Plumage and coloration. — Orbital region more or less nude; pileum 

 without a distinct crest, but sometimes feathers on sides of occiput, im- 

 mediately above auricular region, elongated and forming a hornlike or 

 earlike tuft on each side; no erectile "cape" on hindneck; contour feathers 

 distinctly outlined, broad and rounded or narrower and more triangular 

 (but barely so and with rounded tip). Adult males brilliantly colored 

 or with beautiful and complicated pattern of subdued colors, metallic hues 

 being usually present; tail always with transverse markings. Adult fe- 

 males brownish and buffy, variegated with blackish, etc. 



Range. — Southeastern Europe to eastern Siberia, Japan, and Formosa. 

 (One species with over 40 subspecies, 2 of which are mixed in the stock 

 introduced into North America.) 



PHASIANUS COLCHICUS TORQUATUS Gmelin 



Ring-necked Pheasant 



Adult male. — Forehead black with bright dark green sheen ; broad super- 

 ciliaries white; crown fairly glossy Roman green tinged with ecru-olive, 

 the latter tone becoming more noticeable on the hindcrown and occiput; 

 lores, sides of head, except for a small auricular patch of dark bluish- 

 green feathers that extends forward under the eye, bare; superciliaries 

 narrowly edged below with dark glossy greenish-black feathers like those 

 of the forehead and extending from the forehead to the base of an erectile 

 tuft of truncate iridescent blue-green blackish feathers on the postero- 

 dorsal corner of the occiput on each side; nape very glossy bottle green 

 to dark zinc green, laterally tinged with glossy dark violet-blue, which 

 predominates on the sides of the neck, although even there it is posteriorly 




420 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



replaced by glossy bottle green; chin, throat, and malar region like the 

 forehead but with a little more blue in the sheen and the lower throat 

 becoming bottle green ; a complete (usually) white collar around the base 

 of the neck separates the head and neck coloration from that of the body 

 although in some cases the bottle green continues on the middorsal area 

 for a very little distance posterior to the collar ; interscapulars with their 

 exposed portions bright buff yellow with a terminally widening median 

 wedge of bright blue-green black and with edgings of the same, but slightly 

 duller and narrower; from the base of the median wedge-shaped marks 

 a fuscous to fuscous-black band goes off toward the sides of the feathers 

 in a posteriorly pointed diagonal, leaving a large, white, terminally pointed, 

 triangular space in the center of the feather ; the basal half of the feather 

 dull sepia; in the lower (posterior) interscapulars, the so-called hackle 

 feathers, the white triangles are transformed into bands of white with 

 median fuscous shaft marks and extend into the visible pattern of the 

 overlapping feathers, largely replacing the buff-yellow; these posterior 

 interscapulars also have the bright green terminal median wedges re- 

 placed by dark fuscous (the whole interscapular area varies greatly 

 according to the amount of P. c. colchicus blood in the strain, the buff- 

 yellow becoming more tawny or orange-tawny, the bottle green more blue- 

 black in birds with a larger amount of pure colchicus blood in them) ; 

 scapulars and inner greater and median upper coverts Kaiser brown to 

 Hay's russet with a terminal light magenta gloss and with large white 

 to light buff centers edged with black and sometimes mottled sparingly 

 with the same; lesser inner upper wing coverts with the russet borders 

 narrow or missing, leaving the feathers white bordered and centered with 

 fuscous to fuscous-black ; rest of upper wing coverts light gull gray to Ught 

 neutral gray, paling to white at the bend of the wing; long innennost 

 greater coverts and the long scapulars neutral gray much tinged with 

 pale olive-buff and broadly edged, but not tipped, with Hay's russet (in 

 birds with more colchicus than torquatus blood all the gray feathers are 

 olive-buff, sometimes almost huffy brown, and the russet edges are heavily 

 washed with purplish) ; secondaries pale buffy brown, incompletely barred 

 along the basal half or more of the shaft with backward-pointing, diagonal, 

 white, wavy bars, which are narrowly edged with dusky buffy brown, 

 these marks not showing in the folded wing and sometimes almost be- 

 coming longitudinal wavy marks running toward the base of the feathers ; 

 the innermost secondaries with narrow lateral edgings of Hay's russet; 

 primaries darker and more grayish, less buffy, brown and crossed on both 

 webs with wavy whitish bars except on their terminal portions; upper 

 back like the scapulars, but with the white centers medially marked with 

 deep bottle green ; back, lower back, and rump greenish glaucous to deep 

 lichen green, laterally and posteriorly extensively tinged with glaucous- 

 gray; the feathers of the median part of the back and lower back with

large dusky centers, which are completely edged and sometimes barred 

 and mottled with pale buff^ the dark areas with a greenish gloss terminally, 

 dull fuscous basally ; upper tail coverts like the rump but with some pale 

 tawny-russet edgings ; the dusky median parts with their pale edges com- 

 pletely hidden, by. the elongated tips of the feathers; in birds with more 

 colchicus than torquatus blood, the whole lower back, rump, and upper 

 tail coverts have the glaucous-green and gray replaced by Hay's russet 

 to Kaiser brown, and the green of the back more brownish and darker; 

 tail feathers olive-buff to dark olive-buff crossed by many blackish bars 

 (the longest central pair of rectrices with 20-25 such bars), the bars 

 narrower than the paler interspaces; the lateral edges of the rectrices, 

 except the terminal third or so, brownish vinaceous, the dark bars becom- 

 ing sorghum brown to vinaceous-brown, the edges of the vanes much 

 frayed (in birds with more colchicus than torquatus blood the rectrices 

 are tawny-olive instead of olive-buff, and the lateral parts Verona brown 

 to Prout's brown) ; breast dark coppery hazel, the feathers broadly glossed 

 terminally with magenta purple with narrow W-shaped; black tips the 

 broadest part of the W being the median portion along the shaft, the 

 black with a bluish gloss (in birds with more colchicus blood these dark 

 terminal edges are better developed and sometimes produce a scalloped 

 pattern) ; sides and flanks light, bright buff-yellow, the feathers with 

 large wedge-shaped terminal shaft spots of shining blue-black, narrowly 

 edged with zinc orange in some specimens ; center of upper abdomen 

 black, each feather broadly tipped and less broadly edged with shining 

 dark green or blue-green; lateral to this are a number of feathers like 

 those of the breast but more squarely truncate and with large wedge- 

 shaped terminal spots like the laterally adjacent feathers of the sides and 

 flanks (in birds with more colchicus blood the feathers of the sides and 

 flanks are bright orange-tawny instead of buff-yellow) ; rest of abdomen 

 and thighs dull Prout's brown to mummy brown with a slight mixture 

 of paler buffy brown feathers ; under tail coverts hazel to russet with con- 

 cealed dusky mummy-brown basal-median areas ; the more lateral and 

 anterior of these feathers with a slight amount of pinkish-purplish sheen; 

 undersurface of tail feathers very dark clove brown, the paler interspaces 

 between the dark bars much suffused and mottled with dusky; under 

 wing coverts white to pale buffy white, the axillars with dusky brownish 

 bars ; bare skin of sides of head bright red ; iris hazel ; bill pale greenish 

 yellow; tarsi and toes brownish gray. 



Adult female. — Feathers of center of forehead and crown fuscous-black, 

 edged with whraceous-tawny to hazel, those of the hindcrown and occiput 

 similar but banded and edged with, buffy and only sparingly tinged with 

 hazel ; lores and anterior part of superciliaries (from anterior end of eye 

 to the nape), nape, and sides of neck light vinaceous-fawn to pale grayish 

 vinaceous, each feather narrowly tipped with blackish; the feathers pale

hazel to tawny basally with a broad transverse blotch of dull sepia before 

 the vinaceous-fawn area (this blotch and the tawny area hidden by the 

 overlapping of the feathers) ; interscapulars bright hazel to tawny-rUSset 

 completely edged with pale vinaceous-fawn, the riisset central area termi- 

 nating in a broad fuscous to fuscous-black, distally pointed V ; scapulars 

 and lai-ger inner greater and median upper wing coverts Sayal brown 

 to tawny-olive, edged and tipped with pale buffy; the tawny-olive color 

 giving place to a heavy fuscous-black mass either as an attenuated median 

 pattern extending distally along the shaft or as abruptly transverse area; 

 in the latter case the dark part is more extensive than the tawny portion; 

 rest of upper wing coverts pinkish buff to pale ochraceous-buff, edged 

 with somewhat paler, and with their centers very heavily blotched with 

 dull, dusky sepia; long scapulars and innermost secondaries tawny to 

 tawny-olive, their median areas with heavy elongated blotches and 

 marbling of blackish, edged and tipped with pale buffy ; rest of secondaries 

 dull olive-brown crossed by five to seven bands of pale buffy to pale 

 pinkish buff, these bands much narrower than the dark interspaces but 

 tending to coalesce on the outer margin of the outer secondaries ; primaries 

 rather light clove brown barred with wavy whitish or pale pinkish buff 

 bars, those on the outer webs whitish, those on the inner webs consider- 

 ably suffused with pinkish to pale tawny-buff ; upper back like the scapu- 

 lars ; feathers of the back, lower back, rump, and upper tail coverts deep 

 fuscous-black to chaetura black, broadly edged and tipped with pale 

 pinkish buff to pale tawny-buff, the more posterior ones with the dark 

 centers media:lly divided into V's by buffy shaft stripes which fail to ex- 

 tend to the ends of the feathers; the pale edges wider and tawnier on 

 the upper tail coverts than elsewhere ; rectrices light pinkish avellaneous, 

 the median pairs suffused with hazel medially, all transversely blotched 

 or banded with fuscous-black; on the inner pairs a paler avellaneous

 flecked with dusky brown ; the lateral rectrices considerably suffused with 

 light vinaceous-fawn ; chin and upper throat whitish ; malar stripe and 

 auriculars buffy brown with a slightly golden hue ; lower throat like sides 

 of neck but slightly less vinaceous ; upper breast like lower throat but 

 somewhat more buffy; feathers of breast pinkish buff with a faint oHve- 

 buffy tinge, obscurely and faintly marked with transverse lines of duskier 

 and with concealed large dark brownish V-shaped bars and tawny bases ; 

 feathers of the sides and flanks with these dark brownish markings ex- 

 posed and increased in size and number; upper and lateral parts of ab- 

 domen like the lower breast but without any concealed basal bars or tawny 

 color, and slightly warmer buffy in tone ; middle of lower abdomen similar 

 but slightly paler; thighs like the lateral parts of the abdomen but ob- 

 scurely barred with hair brown; under tail coverts light russet broadly 

 tipped and subtei-minally transversely mottled with pinkish buff; under

 cinnamon-buff and with narrow buffy shafts ; upper wing coverts similar 

 but with lateral extensions of buff from the shafts forming incomplete bars 

 of the same ; secondaries dark fuscous to clove brown barred with pale 

 ashy buff, the pale bars flecked with dusky ; primaries dusky clove brown 

 with fairly broad bars of whitish or very pale buff on the outer webs 

 and also on the basal part of the inner webs; back, lower back, rump, 

 and upper tail coverts dull fuscous to dusky sepia, the feathers completely 

 edged with pale ashy cinnamon-buff and with paler buffy shafts and 

 median wedge-shaped markings of the same, these marks largely absent 

 on the upper tail coverts * ; rectrices dusky avellaneous crossed by many 

 broad bars of clove brown each of which is proximally bordered with 

 tawny Sayal brown, the feathers externally edged with pale ashy cinnamon- 

 buff ; sides of face largely bare ; chin and throat pale buffy to almost 

 white; auricUlars, sides of neck and malar area and lower throat pale 

 warm buff streaked with dull grayish sepia; breast dark pinkish buff 

 spotted with dull sepia; feathers of sides and flanks clove brown to dull

Juvenal female. — Like the corresponding stage of the male but with 

 no 'bare area on the sides of the head; the sides of the neck somewhat 

 more vinaceous, the auriculars less grayish, slightly more brownish; inter- 

 scapulars more vinaceous in tone. 



Natal down. — Forehead arid sides of crown pale cinnamon-buff to 

 ochraceous-buff ; center of crown and occiput dark fuscous to fuscous- 

 black, becoming washed with rufescent on the posterior occiput and nape 

 which is almost chestnut-brown; upperparts of body pale tawny-buff 

 tinged with tawny-russet and with three broad fuscous-black stripes; 

 wings with blotches of fuscous^black and rufescent ; sides of head pale 

 ochraceous-buff; a blackish spot on the auriculars ;, a light sepia malar 

 streak ; underparts pale buffy yellow tinged with tawny or pale ochraceous. 



■According to Leffingwell (Occ. Pap. Conner Mus., i, 1928, 21) the upper tail 

 coverts in juvenal males are barred "with olive buff, often running to chestnut 

 on the margins." I have seen but one young male and do not find this to hold for it.

Range.— NaXive to "eastern and south-eastern China from Canton to 

 ' Hunan, north to the Lower and Middle Yangtse, up the river at least to 

 Ichang; north to Pekin, Kalgan, and the Ordos country" (Beebe). The 

 nominate form, P. c. c'olchicus, the blood of which also enters into our 

 hybrid ring-necked pheasants, is native to "Transcaucasia, including the 

 basins of the Rion and the Chorokh Rivers and the southeastern coast of 

 the Black Sea, north to Sukhum-Kale, just south of the main east and 

 west chain of the Caucasus Mountains; the bases of the Kura and lower 

 Araxes and their tributaries up to nearly three thousand feet above sea 

 level. It touches the Caspian Sea at the Kizil-Agalch Gulf" (Beebe). 

 ' Introduced now and fairly well established in approximately the north- 

 ern half of the United States and in southern Canada; large parts of 

 Europe (where the colchicus stirain is more in evidence than is the 

 torquatus) — Belgium, France, England, Germany, Greece, Holland, 

 Sweden, and Italy; 4lso in Hawaii (Oahu, Molokai, and Kauai), Samoa 

 (subsp. ?), St. Helena, and New Zealand. In North America it was 

 first introduced about 1790 in New Hampshire, then about 1800 in New 

 Jersey; 1857 in California; 1881 in Oregon; besides other smaller in- 

 troductions. Its present North American taiige is from Vancouver 

 Island and southern British Columbia, southern Alberta, southern Mani- 

 toba, southern Ontario, and southwestern Maine, south to Maryland, 

 Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and Cal- 

 ifornia. South of this area its introduction has not been particularly 

 successful, but it may be noted that about 1928 the bird was listed as a 

 game species in all but three States of the United States. 



Unsuccessfully introduced into Chile.

Galliform birds with postacetabulum longer than preacetabulum, and 

 longer than broad; furcula weak and (viewed laterally) straight, with 

 rodlike acetabulum ; acromial process of scapula peculiar in shape. 



Bill rather narrow and elongate, the cere nearly as long as rhampho- 

 theca, the line of junction of the latter with the former slightly but dis- 

 tinctly depressed; nostril longitudinally narrowly oval^ elliptical, or 

 fusiform, about parallel with axis of bill ; head and upper neck nude, with 

 fleshy caruncles and corrugations and an elongated fleshy erectile caruncu- 

 lar appendage on anterior part of forehead in adult males (these caruncles 

 and corrugations absent or indistinct in females, in which the nude parts 

 are more or less covered or sprinkled with short downy feathers) . Wing 

 moderate, moderately concave beneath, the longest primaries longer than 

 longest secondaries, the outer primaries moderately, bowed or incurved; 

 fifth, or fifth and sixth, primaries longest, the first (outermost) about 

 equal to or a little shorter than tenth. Tail decidedly shorter than wing, 

 flat (not vaulted), rather strongly rounded (the difference in length 

 between middle and lateral rectrices equal to less than , one-fourth the 

 length of tail), the ' rectrices (18) very broad with slightly rounded or 

 subtruncate tips. Tarsus stout, relatively long (about one-third as long 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 437 



as wing), the acrotarsium with two rows of interdigitating broad trans- 

 verse scutella (as in most of Phasianidae) , the planta tarsi also with two 

 rows, but on inner side the row of large scutella separated from the frontal 

 scutella and replaced on lower portion by small hexagonal or lozenge- 

 shaped scales; adult males with a more or less prominent (sometimes 

 long and acute) strong spur on lower portion of planta tarsi, about three- 

 fourths the distance from upper end to base of hallux ; middle toe about 

 half as long as tarsus or a little more, the outer toe reaching to beyond 

 penultimate articulation of middle toe (nearly if not quite to middle of 

 subterminal phalanx), the irmer toe slightly shorter; hallux a little more 

 than half as long as basal phalanx of middle toe; a well-developed web 

 between basal phalanges of anterior toes; claws relatively small, very 

 slightly curved, blunt. 



Plumage mid coloration. — Head and upper neck nude, or in females 

 more or less covered with short downy feathers; feathers of lower neck 

 and body very broad, with truncate or subtruncate tips ; remiges strong, 

 the proximal secondaries very broad, with rounded tips, the primaries very 

 rigid ; plumage of lower abdomen and anal region soft and almost downy, 

 that of thighs short and soft. General color dark with metallic reflec- 

 tions, less brilliant in females, most x)i the feathers margined terminally 

 with black, the remiges grayish dusky more or less barred with white ; bare 

 skin of head and neck brightly colored in life (white, blue, and red in one 

 genus; blue and orange in another). 



Range.- — Eastern temperate and tropical North America, south to 

 British Honduras and eastern Guatemala. (Two monotypic genera.) 



The Meleagrididae are very closely related to the Phasianidae but difier 

 in a sufficient number of characters to warrant their recognition as a 

 distinct family. They are exclusively American, while the typical Phasi- 

 anidae (Phasianinae) are found only in Eurasia and Africa. 



KEY TO THE GENERA OF MELEAGRIDIDAE 



a. Crown without a vertical process or protuberance; adult male with a beardlike 

 tuft of long, coarse, stiff bristles on center of chest; tail less strongly rounded, 

 the difference in length between middle and outer rectrices equal to but little, 

 if any, more than half the length of tarsus, the rectrices broader and less 

 rounded (nearly subtruncate) at tips; rectrices without metallic tips or 



subterminal ocelli Meleagris (p. 437) 



aa. Crown, in male, with a conspicuous subcylindrical erect protuberance ; no beard- 

 like tuft on chest ; tail more strongly rounded, the difference in length between 

 middle and lateral rectrices equal to about distance from heel joint to base 

 of hallux, the rectrices narrower and distinctly rounded at tips; rectrices with 

 a terminal band of bright metallic coppery bronze and a subterminal spot or 

 ocellus of metallic blue Agriocharis (p. 458)

 frontal appendage much smaller or rudimentary; "beard" smaller and 

 tarsal spurs absent or rudimentary ; the neck more extensively feathered, 

 the feathers extending to the nape; the head, especially above, more or 

 less sparsely covered with short dusky downy feathers and small bristles ; 

 the feathers of the neck, back, and underparts with more or less distinct 

 pale terminal edges ; the tips of the feathers of the breast, flanks, and sides

 the beard shorter"^* and in the male the tarsal spurs and the frontal append- 

 age smaller. 



Immature male. — Similar to the adult male in size and to the adult 

 female in coloration but retains the two outer juvenal primaries. 



Immature female. — Similar to the adult female but lacks the beard and 

 retains the two outer juvenal primaries. 



Juvenal (sexes alike). — Forehead and anterior part of crown light 

 pinkish cinnamon darkening to pinkish cinnamon on the posterior part of 

 crown ; occiput and nape pinkish cinnamon splotched with Brussels brown 

 to clove brown, this darker color largely on the basal parts of the feathers, 

 which do not completely overlap ; hindneck and uppermost interscapulars 

 dusky hair brown to chaetura drab, the feathers with whitish shafts and 



"The elongated frontal appendage is largest (longest) during the breeding season 

 and may then attain a length of 3 inches or more ; in the winter it may shrink to less 

 than 1 inch. 



"According to some workers who deal with live wild turkeys, a male with a 

 beard less than 4 inches long is probably a first-year bird, while females seldom 

 develop beards until they are three years old.

"Birds from the Wichita National Forest are only doubtfully identifiable as 

 silvestris, but this seems to be due to mixing of strains there by local introduction. 



"It may fairly be questioned whether Linnaeus based his Meleagris gallopavo 

 more on the wild turkey of the Eastern United States or the domesticated bird, and 

 possibly those who insist upon the latter are right ; but this does not affect the right 

 of a subsequent author when dealing with a composite species to restrict the original 

 name according to his best judgment. In 1856, John Gould thus restricted the 

 specific name gallopavo to the wild bird of the Eastern United States and named 

 the wild turkey of eastern Mexico (which is unquestionably the parent stock of the 

 domesticated turkey) M. mexicana. The principle involved is a very simple and 

 just one, and there are few of those already incorporated with the rules of zoological 

 nomenclature which are more potent to prevent the unnecessary shifting of names 

 than this. It is true that the wild turkey of the Eastern United States had received 

 several different specific names prior to Gould's discrimination of two species, in 

 1856 ; but the authors of these several names did not recognize two species and there- 

 fore merely renamed the composite one, thus merely adding synonyms to the eastern 

 form as clearly separated by Gould. (R.R.)

Adult male. — Similar to that of M. g. silvestris but smaller and with 

 the upper tail coverts and the rectrices with paler tips, those of the coverts 

 being cinnamon-buff with a slight tawny tinge, those of the rectrices being 

 Venus brown paling distally to pinkish cinnamon; the rectrices in many 

 specimens tend to be more barred with blackish over the area basal to the 

 black subterminal band, the brown interspaces somewhat freckled with 

 blackish in others, they are vermiculated on the more median ones; the 

 tips of the flank feathers paler and more cinnamomeous ; the lower back 

 and rump almost solid glossy blackish with rather faint subterminal bluish- 

 green reflections (not pinkish or' coppery as in silvestris) ; the metallic 

 reflections of the rest of the body more brilliant, less bronzy, agreeing in 

 this respect with M. g. osceola, inner webs of innermost secondaries more 

 heavily mottled with dusky and their outer webs more strongly glossed 

 with greenish purplish ; other secondaries darker, the brown areas fuscous ; 

 tarsal spur short and stubby as in silvestris; tips of under tail coverts a;nd 

 flanks paler — cinnamon-buffy. Birds from Wichita Mountains, Okla., 

 are intermediate between silvestris and intermedia, more like silvestris 

 in the color of the inner webs of the inner secondaries and the barring of 

 the rectrices. 



Adult female. — Similar to that of M. g. silvestris but smaller and with 

 the feathers of lower back and rump and the upper tail coverts and the 

 rectrices with paler tips — cinnamon-buif to fairly pale pinkish buff; the 

 rectrices averaging more definitely barred proximal to the subterminal 

 black band; secondaries paler, more whitish on their outer margins, the 

 innermost ones sandy grayish cinnamon-buff ; feathers of the breast, upper 

 abdomen, sides, arid flanks tipped with pale pinkish buff.

Adult male. — Similar to that of M. g. gallopavo but with the upper 

 back and wing coverts duller, more purplish bronzy, and with the lower 



™ The use of the name mexicana is unfortunately still unsettled and must remain 

 so until it is possible to examine the type specimen critically. Furtherrnore, the 

 type locality is also uncertain and has been arrived at by faunal inference rather 

 than by definite data. If it were to be accepted as originally given — Real del Monte, 

 Hidalgo, it would seem (from geographic reasoning) that mexicana would probably 

 have to be treated as a synonym of gallopavo, but if Nelson's interpretation of the 

 case be followed and the type locality be considered as Bolafios, northern Jalisco, 

 the course here adopted would be the correct one. At any rate, there are two 

 distinct forms of the turkey involved in the currently used comprehensive "gallopavo" 

 concept, and the names mexicana and gallopavo are used here in an attempt to 

 render more distinct the two forms and their literature.

 white ; the iridescence of the body feathers, both above and below, darker, 

 less brilHantly green and copper ; the head less heavily clothed with black 

 hairlike feathers ; the feathers of the back of the neck lighter and more 

 grayish brown, less cinnamomeous ; the basal two-thirds of the tail more 

 barred, less vermiculated than in M. g. gallopavo, agreeing in this respect

Genus AGRIOCHARIS Chapman 



Agriocharis Chapman, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., viii, 1896, 288. (Type, by 



original description, Meleagris ocellata Cuvier.) 

 Eumeleagris CouES, Key North Amer. Birds, ed. 5, ii, 1903, 727. (Type, by raonotypy, 



Meleagris ocellata Cuvier.) 



Large gallinaceous birds (length about 83.5-102 cm.) closely resembling 

 Meleagris ^* but differing in the absence of a jugular beard and presence, 

 in adult rriale, of an erect protuberance or subcylindrical knob on crown, 

 decidedly more strongly rounded tail, and more brilliantly metallic colora- 

 tion. Bill rather elongated and narrow (the culmen about equal to distance 

 from its base to rictus), its depth at base of culmen slightly less than its 

 width at same point; nostril longitudinal, elliptical, in anterior portion 

 of the rather long nasal fossa ; head and upper neck nude, with scattered 

 wartlike excrescences, the adult male with a flexible elongated appendage 

 on anterior portion of forehead (as in Meleagris) and a vertical, sub- 

 cylindrical knob or protuberance on posterior portion of crown, this 

 permanently erect and much thicker than the frontal appendage; wing 

 moderate, moderately concave beneath, the longest primaries slightly but 



^ Four specimens including this type. 



* Agriocharis is, in fact, so closely related to Meleagris that I am somewhat 

 doubtful as to the expediency of recognizing it as a genus. One of the alleged char- 

 acters certainly does not hold good, namely, the long and very sharp tarsal spur, 

 a precisely similar spur often occurring in Meleagris gallopavo osceola; in fact, in 

 an adult male Agriocharis ocellata now before me, the spur on one leg is only 

 moderately long and very blunt, while that on the other leg is a very small obtuse 

 cone — in fact is rudimentary! (R.R.) 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA

decidedly longer than longest secondaries ; secondaries broad, with rounded 

 tips; primaries rigid, the fifth or sixth longest, the first (outermost) 

 heel joint to base of hallux, the rectrices (18) moderately broad, with 

 slightly shorter than tenth; tail shorter than wing, stronger rounded, the

460 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM 



middle rectrices exceeding lateral pair by about length of tarsus from 

 distinctly rounded tips ; tarsus about one-third as long as wing, stout, the 

 spur on lower part of planta tarsi (in adult males) usually long and 

 very acute ; middle toe nearly half as long as tarsus, the outer toe reach- 

 ing decidedly beyond penultimate articulation of middle toe, the inner 

 toe slightly shorter ; hallux much shorter than basal phalanx of middle toe. 



Plumage and coloration. — Feathers of lower neck, back, rump, chest, 

 breast, sides and flanks, together with scapulars and smaller wing coverts 

 very broad, with truncate or subtruncate tips, those of lower abdomen 

 and anal region soft and somewhat downy, those of thighs short, soft, 

 and rounded; secondaries moderately broad, with rounded tips, the 

 primaries rigid. General color brilliant green with golden and bluish 

 reflections, the greater wing coverts brilliant coppery bronze, the upper 

 tail coverts and tail broadly tipped with brilliant coppery bronze preceded 

 by a broad band or ocellus of brilliant coppery bronze, the secondaries 

 extensively white on outer webs ; bare skin of head and upper neck bright 

 blue in life, the wartlike excrescences orange or orange-red. 



Range. — Yucatan and adjacent parts of Guatemala and British Hon- 

 duras. (Monotypic.) 



AGRIOCHARIS OCELLATA (Cnvier) 

 OCELLATED TURKEY 



Adult male. — Basal half or more of the neck greenish bronze or bronze- 

 green, each feather tipped with bright metallic green or bronze-green and 

 with a subterminal bar, more or less complete, of velvety black; upper 

 breast similar, but the terminal bars more bronzy, the lower breast, sides, 

 and flanks with the terminal bars becoming gradually broader and more 

 coppery posteriorly, with remainder of each feather more blackish; ab- 

 domen, anal region, and thighs plain sooty or dusky, the longer under 

 tail coverts metallic bluish green or greenish blue subterminally and 

 broadly tipped with brilliant metallic copper-bronze; feathers of back 

 metallic bronze-green, blackish on concealed portion, broadly tipped with 

 bright greenish bronze (becoming bright coppery isabelline in certain 

 lights), and with a narrow subterminal bar of black, the scapulars similar 

 but with terminal bars broader and more brassy bronze; smaller wing 

 coverts bright metallic green, more bluish toward bend of wing, more 

 bronzy posteriorly, each with a narrow subterminal bar of black ; greater 

 wing coverts brilliant metallic coppery bronze ; inner secondaries grayish 

 brown with irregular, broken oblique bars of white, the distal secondaries 

 with outer webs white with concealed spots of grayish brown next to 

 shaft, corresponding with larger spots or imperfect bands on middle 

 secondaries; primaries, primary coverts, and alula grayish dusky with 

 irregular oblique bars of white on both webs; feathers of rump bright 

 metallic blue, broadly tipped with bronze and crossed by a broad bar of 




BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA 461 



velvety black, the upper tail coverts similar but with bronzy tips becoming 

 gradually broader and more reddish bronze or coppery; tail light gray, 

 transversely vermiculated or very narrowly and irregularly barred with 

 dusky, broadly tipped with bright metallic red-bronze or coppery bronze 

 and with subterminal band of velvety black enclosing, or partly enclosing, 

 a large spot or ocellus of bright metallic blue ; bare skin of head and upper 

 neck blue (in life), the wartHke excrescences and tip of vertical knob and 

 frontal tubercle orange or orange-red '^ ; bill dull red ; iris dark brown ; 

 legs and feet lake red, the larger scutella edged with brownish. 



Adult jenude. — Similar to the adult male but smaller and averaging 

 less brilliant in coloration; the ocelli at the tips of the tail feathers much 

 reduced, the tarsal spurs lacking or reduced to small knobs, and the 

 frontal process smaller. 



Gray phase (?)^^. — Similar to the adult female but the feathers of the 

 hindneck, interscapulars, scapulars, and lesser upper wing coverts much 

 less greenish, most of them with the terminal bar paler — dull opaline 

 green to variscite green, as contrasted with cobalt green in the adult 

 (although in some of the feathers these tips are like those of the adult) ; 

 feathers of the upper and lower back with the broad terminal bars pale 

 purplish gray mixed with a light yellowish-olive sheen, which in some 

 lights looks slightly coppery; feathers of rump with much broader and 

 brighter coppery tips, subterminally edged with velvety black, next to 

 which is a broad band of bluish green which is basally edged with velvety 

 black, the remainder (usually concealed) of the feathers being fuscous- 

 black vermiculated with grayish white; rectrices as in adult but the tips 

 paler, less coppery; breast and sides as in the adult but with narrower 

 and somewhat duller tips to the feathers; abdomen, flanks, and thighs 

 slightly paler, more fuscous, less blackish than in adults. 



Juvenal jenudeP — Upper back, scapulars, and lesser upper wing 

 coverts chaetura black basally and medially, broadly edged and tipped 

 with cinnamon-buff to light ochraceous-salmon ; greater upper wing 

 coverts light pinkish cinnamon broadly tipped with white and subtermi- 

 nally splotched and basally suffused with chaetura black; primaries hair 

 brown, externally edged with pale pinkish cinnamon, internally and 

 terminally edged with whitish, the outer webs crossed by a few irregular 



" According to Gaumer (Trans. Kansas Acad. Sci., viii, 1883, 60) freshly killed 

 specimens have "twenty-four fleshy processes arranged in two rows on the front 

 part of the neck, and about twenty more of the same kind form two rows over the 

 head ; many smaller ones are scattered over the head. At the point of union of the 

 bill with the head, there is a long fleshy process capable of much erection and disten- 

 sion. Behind this the fleshy scalp is permanently elevated so as to form a flat- 

 topped pyramid, with its greatest length from bill to occiput." 



""One unsexed specimen apparently adult, without spurs, from Guatemala.

bars of pale pinkish cinnamon ; secondaries with the outer webs light 

 pinkish cinnamon tipped with white and crossed by five or six broad 

 blotches of chaetura black giving a heavily banded appearance, their 

 inner webs hair brown vermiculated finely with dusky, tipped with white 

 like the outer webs and subterminally somewhat suffused with pale pinkish 

 cinnamon; rectrices with both webs similar to the outer webs of the 

 secondaries.^* ■ '

'■"Very inadequate material suggests that there may be an irattiature plumage be- 

 tween the Juvenal and the adult stages. An unsexed adult bird from Guatemala 

 (U.S.N.M. No. 132188) has a few scapulars similar to the juvenal described above 

 but grayer and crossed by more but narrower blackish bands. It also has an outermost 

 rectrix which is gray as in the adult tail feather but has the unvermiculated bars 

 much wider than the white and brownish-gray vermiculated transverse areas (just 

 the opposite of the adult condition) and lacks the subterminal ocellus, the terminal 

 bronzy bars being dull dusky toward the tip which is very pointed (flatly rotjnded 

 in adults). These few feathers — scapiilars and a rectrix — are the only indication I 

 have seen of an immature plumage, but I cannot explain them in any other way. 

 Two females from Campeche, described by Shufeldt (Auk, xxx, 1913, 432) and 

 examined by me in the present connection, have the remiges devoid of white cross 

 bars, but are not immature as far as other characters are concerned. They seem to 

 me to be adult, but I cannot account for their peculiar wing feathers.
