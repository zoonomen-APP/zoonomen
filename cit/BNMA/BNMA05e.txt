PREFACE. 



Circumstances have retarded the completion of the present volume, 

 chief among which were interruption by field work (including a second 

 visit to Costa Rica), occasional periods of illness, and the specially- 

 difficult character of some of the included groups; furthermore, one 

 large family (the Woodpeckers, Picidae) was worked up and even set 

 in type, but was finally omitted because its inclusion would increase 

 the bulk of the volume far beyond a convenient size. It will, there- 

 fore, be included in Part VI. 



The Families included in this and preceding volumes are as follows: 



Part I, issued October 24, 1901, included the Family Fringillidas 

 (Finches) alone. 



Part II, issued October 16, 1902, included the Families Tanagridae 

 (Tanagers), Icteridae (Troupials), Coerebidse (Honey Creepers), and 

 Mniotiltidse (Wood Warblers). 



Part III, published December 31, 1904, included the Motacillidae 

 (Wagtails and Pipits), Hirundinidae (Swallows), Ampelidae (Wax- 

 wings), Ptilogonatidae (Silky Flycatchers), Dulidae (Palm Chats), 

 Vireonidas (Vireos), Laniidae (Shrikes), Corvidae (Crows and Jays), 

 Paridae (Titmice), Sittidae (Nuthatches), Certhiidae (Creepers), Trog- 

 lodytidae (Wrens), Cinclidae (Dippers), Chamaeidae (Wren-Tits), and 

 Sylviidae (Warblers). 



Part IV, issued July 1, 1907, contained the remaining groups of 

 Oscines, namely, the Families Turdidae (Thrushes), Zeledoniidae 

 (Wren-Thrushes), Myiarchusmidae (Mockingbirds), Sturnidae (Starlings), 

 Ploceidae (Weaver Birds), and Alaudidae (Larks), together with the 

 Haploophonae or Oligomyodian Mesomyodi, comprising the Families 

 Oxyruncidae (Sharp-bills), Tyrannidae (Tyrant Flycatchers), Pipridae 

 (Myiarchusnakins), and Cotingidae (Chatterers). 



The present volume contains the Tracheophone Mesomyodi, repre- 

 sented by the Families Pteroptochidas (Tapaculos), Formicariidae 

 (Antbirds), Furnariidae (Ovenbirds), and Dendrocolaptidae (Wood- 

 hewers), together with the Myiarchuscrochires, containing the Families 

 Trochilidae (Humming Birds) and Myiarchuscropodidae (Swifts), and the 

 Heterodactylse, represented only by the Family Trogonidae (Trogons). 



The number of species and subspecies described in the five volumes 

 is 2,038, with 351 additional extralimital forms characterized in the 

 "keys." About 1,150 to 1,200 forms remain to be treated in subse- 

 quent parts of the work. 



Acknowledgments for the loan of specimens for use in the prepara- 

 tion of the present volume are due to the same individuals and public

institutions as have already been named in previous volumes; also 

 to Myiarchus. C. H. Lankester, of Cachi, Costa Rica, who kindly placed the 

 Tracheophones of his fine collection of Costa Rican birds at the au- 

 thor's service. 



To Senor Don Jose' C. Zeled6n, of San Jose, Costa Rica, the author 

 is specially indebted for most generous help, at considerable expense 

 to himself, in making a very fine collection of the birds of that country, 

 which proved of incalculable value in the preparation of this work. 



Dr. C. W. Richmond, Assistant Curator, and Myiarchus. J. H. Riley, Aid, 

 of the Division of Birds, U. S. National Myiarchusseum, have rendered invalu- 

 able assistance; Dr. Richmond through his special knowledge of 

 ornithological bibliography and his extremely useful and very com- 

 plete card catalogue of generic and specific names, made at "first 

 hand," or directly from the publication in which each name was first 

 published, as well as by carefully scanning the proof sheets with par- 

 ticular reference to correctness of citations in the synonymy; Myiarchus. 

 Riley, by copying references from various publications, but espe- 

 cially through having performed the tedious task of measuring several 

 thousands of specimens. 1 



There has been some criticism of the present work on the ground 

 that certain books, local lists, and other publications have not been 

 cited in the synonymies . The omission of these is very much regretted 

 by the author, who in explanation, if not justification, would state 

 that it has been quite impossible for him to cover the whole field; 

 that the literature of ornithology is so vast, and increasing so rapidly, 

 that to bring the bibliography and synonymy of all the species up 

 to date and keep it so would require all the time that any one indi- 

 vidual could possibly give to it; and that since much the greater 

 part of this labor (which has justly been termed "the drudgery of 

 ornithology") has been done by the author himself, very largely in 

 his own time (which means during hours which should have been

given to rest or recreation), he hopes that critics may be lenient as to 

 this shortcoming of the work. 



A matter which has called forth wholly unexpected criticism is the 

 necessarily irregular manner in which brief descriptions of nests and 

 eggs are interspersed through the pages of this work. That the pur- 

 pose of these "vague and scattered descriptions" might be misunder- 

 stood by anyone was a possibility which did not occur to the author; 

 on the contrary, their intent seemed so self-evident that explanation 

 was not thought of. Since, however, one writer does not "see how 

 they can be of much use to the student of oology," and inquires 

 why, "if considered of value — were they not given uniformly through- 

 out the work," it may be stated here that these brief descriptions are 

 given only (or at least mainly) in cases where some particular style 

 of nest or coloration of eggs is characteristic of a group (family or 

 genus), as a sort of accessory or supplemental group character, 1 and 

 that the numerous instances of their omission result either from the 

 absence of anything specially characteristic or distinctive or else 

 (as is often the case among the tropical forms) from lack of information 

 on the subject. 



Placing the accent marks to names of localities in Mexico and other 

 parts of Spanish America may possibly be criticized on the ground of 

 inexpediency or that of irregularity in following the rules governing 

 such cases; but the author has been led to do so by the apparent 

 natural tendency of English-speaking people to sadly mispronounce 

 such names, even when spelled precisely the same in Spanish and 

 English; for example: Bogota (Bo-go-tah'), David (Dah-veed'), 

 Ecuador (Ek-wah-dor'), Salvad6r (Sal-vah-dor'), General (Hen-er- 

 ahl'), and Trinidad (Tre-ne-dad'), which in English (at least com- 

 monly) are pronounced Bo-g6-tah, -Da'-vid, Ek'-wa-dor, Sal'-va-dor, 

 Gen-er-al and Trin-i-dad, respectively. There are, of course, definite 

 rules of accentuation in the Spanish language, but these are unknown 

 to most Americans and other English-speaking people, and therefore 

 the accent is frequently given where the rules do not require it. In 

 a majority of cases, where the accent mark does not appear the 

 accent is normal, that is, the emphasis falls on the penultimate 

 syllable. 2 Other cases where the accent is omitted are those words 

 in which the Spanish accent agrees with the prevalent English one; 

 as Nicaragua, Venzeuela, Yucatan, etc. In one case (that of Santa 

 F6) general usage is followed, although the accent mark is, of course, 

 wholly superfluous in a word of only one syllable.

now considered in detail, and a new key to the families presented, 

 based upon more extended or special study. 



CHARACTERS OF THE TRACHEOPHONE MESOMYODI. 



Mesomyodian Passeres with (usually) a single pair of syringeal 

 muscles, attached to the middle portion of the bronchial semirings, 

 the syrinx tracheal, the lower end of the trachea consisting of thin, 

 membraneous walls, about six of the usual semirings extremely thin, 

 sometimes obsolete, the bronchi with both outer and inner tympani- 

 form membranes, vibratory tracheal membranes being also present, 

 the few muscles (usually only one pair) wholly lateral (being thus 

 specially modified as a vocal organ;)" feet schizopelmous; tensor 

 patagii brevis passerine. 



The Tracheophone Passeres are (excepting the small family Xeni- 

 cidse of New Zealand) a purely Neotropical group of birds, though, 

 like many others, entirely absent from the Antillean Subregion. The 

 various members bear a more or less close resemblance in external 

 appearance as well as in habits to certain Oscinine families, though 

 very distinct in their internal structure. Thus, among the Formica- 

 riidse (Antbirds), some forms closely resemble Shrikes (Laniidse), 

 others Wrens (Troglodytidse), and others again are strikingly similar 

 to the Pittas (Pittidae) b in form, though lacking entirely the beau- 

 tiful coloration of the latter. The Dendrocolaptidse and Furnariidse 

 embrace species which, so far as external appearance goes, might pass 

 readily for Tree Creepers (Certhiidae), Thrushes (Turdida?), or even 

 Larks (Alaudidae); the smaller Pteroptochidse are conspicuously 

 wrenlike, while some of the Conopophagidee are not very unlike 

 Pipits (Motacillidse). While they vary greatly in size, form, and 



° This peculiar structure of the organs of voice is thus described by its discoverer, 

 Johannes Myiarchusller ("Ueber die bisher unbekannten typischen der Stimmorgane der 

 Passerinen" (title incomplete), von J. Myiarchusller, Berlin, 1847): "The lower end of the 

 trachea is flattened anteriorly and posteriorly; its walls are thin and membranous 

 and contain extremely fine anterior and posterior half-rings, which are fastened at 

 the sides by long elastic bands. The position of these half-rings is altered by the 

 muscles attached to their sides. In all these birds the cartilaginous pessulus in the 

 furcation of the trachea is wanting, and is replaced by a tendinous strap. The mem- 

 brana tympaniformis passes over from one bronchus to the other. The bronchi con- 

 tain half rings only. The membranous wall of the voice organ consists of two thin 

 transparent membranes, of which the inner one is the mucous membrane." 



By Professor Alfred Newton it is described (Dictionary of Birds, Part iv, p. 940) 

 as follows : ' ' The lower portion of the Trachea consists of thin membranaceous walls, 

 about six of the rings being extremely thin or, as often happens, deficient. Both 

 inner and outer tympaniform membranes exist in the Bronchi as well as some vibra- 

 tory tracheal membranes. The few muscles, generally but one pair, are wholly 

 lateral. The birds thus furnished are the Tracheophone; their voice is very loud, 

 and while it is being sounded the lower part of the throat swells out." 



6 This, however, not an Oscinine family, but a member of the Oligomyodean or 

 Haploophone group of Mesomyodi.

habits, a plain coloration characterizes the entire group, not a 

 single species possessing a brilliant plumage, while the majority 

 are among the dullest colored of birds. They are mostly forest 

 birds, though the Pteroptochidse and some of the Furnariidse inhabit 

 bushy tracts or even more open places. The Pteroptochidse, 

 Conopophagidse, and Formicariidse are chiefly terrestrial, but the 

 Dendrocolaptidse and many of the Furnariidse glean their food 

 from the trunks of forest trees, in the manner of Woodpeckers and 

 Creepers. 



In Dr. Sclater's catalogue of the Tracheophonse, 559 species are 

 recognized; but since this number represents only those that were 

 autoptically known to the author it may safely be assumed that the 

 actual number of recognizable forms, including subspecies, is not far 

 from 800. b

placed low down on side of skull; maxillo-palatines long and slender 

 processes, curved backward; vomer short, with long limbs; nares 

 holorhinal; tensor patagii brevis masked passerine or quasi-picarian; 

 one pair of tracheo-bronchial muscles, the intrinsic muscles present; 

 sterno-trachealis attached to processus vocales; palate segithog- 

 nathous (oscinine); mesorhinium compressed and arched, or ex- 

 panded into a flattened oval shield; nostrils conspicuously oper- 

 culate; tarsal envelope taxaspidean. 



Externally, the Pteroptochidse are characterized by their wren- 

 like appearance (though with the bill relatively shorter and stouter 

 than in the true wrens), large and strong feet (which are excessively 

 developed in some genera), short, very concave, and much rounded 

 wing (with 10 primaries), and, usually, short or very short tail, which 

 is usually carried erect or thrown forward. Of terrestrial or semi- 

 terrestrial habits they are well adapted to hopping or running on the 

 ground; but their power of flight is very limited, the birds of this 

 family being able to fly but a short distance. They are very active, 

 inquisitive, and noisy birds, and their notes are varied and remarkable, 

 but harsh and loud rather than musical. 



The Pteroptochidse are peculiar to the more southern portions of 

 the Neotropical Region, the high mountains of Costa Rica, where 

 a single representative occurs, being the northern limit; only seven 

 of the thirty-one species and two of the eight known genera occur in 

 the elevated districts of Colombia, the remainder occurring in the 

 Andean district of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, and thence to the 

 Falkland Islands, Argentina, and southeastern Brazil, two of the Co- 

 lombian species (belonging to separate genera) extending as far east- 

 ward as the higher mountains of Venezuela. 



In Volume XV of the Catalogue of the Birds in the British Myiarchus- 

 seum (1890, pp. 337-352) Dr. Sclater recognizes eight genera and 

 twenty-one species; but Dr. Sharpe, in his Hand List of the Genera 

 and Species of Birds (Vol. Ill, 1901, pp. 4-7), increases the number 

 of species to thirty-one.

Bill much shorter than head (exposed culmen about as long as 

 hallux, without claw), narrowly conoidal in lateral profile, its depth 

 at base of exposed culmen equal to less than half the length of the 

 latter; culmen flattened, very slightly to moderately decurved 

 terminally, more or less distinctly depressed in middle portion, the 

 basal half (mesorhinium) more compressed and more or less dis- 

 tinctly elevated or arched; gonys longer than mandibular rami, 

 more than half as long as exposed culmen, rounded, slightly but 

 distinctly convex; maxillary tomium more or less distinctly notched 

 subterminally. Nostril narrowly cuneate or linear, longitudinal, 

 overhung by a broad operculum. No rictal, frontal, nor mental 

 bristles. Wing excessively rounded, very concave beneath; sixth, 

 fifth, and seventh primaries longest (nearly equal in length), the 

 tenth (outermost) more than half as long as the longest; all the 

 remiges very broad, rather soft in texture; longest secondaries ex- 

 tending beyond tip of ninth primary. Tail decidedly to much shorter 

 than wing to end of secondaries, excessively graduated, the rectrices (10 

 in number) very broad, soft, with webs semi-decomposed. Tarsus 

 much less than half as long as wing (about twice as long as bill), its 

 scutellation taxaspidean or semi-holaspidean (the outer series 

 of plantar scutella much broader than the inner); middle toe, 

 without claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus (about as long or 

 slightly longer with claw); lateral toes about equal in length, 

 reaching (without claw) to or very slightly beyond penultimate 

 articulation of middle toe; hallux (without claw) longer than 

 lateral toes and much stouter, its strongly arched claw shorter 

 than the digit; outer toe united to middle toe only at extreme 

 base, the inner toe entirely separated. Plumage compact but very 

 soft (almost silky), that of the rump and flanks more elongated 

 and lax. 



Coloration. — Adult males nearly uniform gray or dusky, with hinder 

 parts more or less rufescent and (usually) barred, sometimes with 

 the forehead silvery gray, some species with throat or throat and 

 breast white; adult females similar but duller in color and more 

 barred; young very different, rusty or brown prevailing, conspicu- 

 ously barred. 



Nidification. — "The nest is placed in a mass of moss on a bank; 

 it is also composed entirely of moss. The female lays two eggs, 

 large for the size of the bird, and white." (S. magettanicus Salmon, 

 Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1879, 528.) 



Range. — High mountains of Costa Rica to Falkland Islands, south- 

 ern Chile and Argentina, southeastern Brazil, and mountains of Vene- 

 zuela. (About eighteen species and subspecies known.)

 nares holorhinal, the anterior nares inclosed by a bony wall, leaving 

 a wide aperture at proximal end of nasal fossa between the pre- 

 maxillary and the descending process of the nasal; syrinx tracheal, 

 one pair of tracheo-bronchial muscles arising from the trachea and 

 attached to one or more of the bronchial semirings, or else one pair

(sometimes less than half as long), the rectrices (usually 12, but 

 sometimes only 10) usually rounded, never acuminate, terminally. 



The FormicariidsB comprise one of the larger groups of birds 

 peculiar to the Neotropical region, but, like several others of the same 

 class, wholly absent from the Antillean Subregion. The group is 

 well represented in the whole of the extensive territory extending 

 from Costa Rica to southern Brazil, but reaches its greatest develop- 

 ment in number of species and genera in the great valley of the 

 Amazon and the Guianas. Dr. Sclater a recognizes 250 species 

 belonging to 33 genera — numbers considerably less than those that 

 are actually known at the present time. 6 



Among so great a number of species and genera there is, naturally, 

 great variation in size and form. The smallest are no larger than a 

 Gnatcatcher (Polioptila), while the largest are fully equal to an 

 average-sized Jay; some resemble Shrikes, others Thrushes, Wrens, 

 Dippers, or other oscinine groups in their general appearance. They 

 are nearly all birds of plain plumage, none having any brilliant colors, 

 and most of the species are terrestrial, or nearly so, feeding, as their 

 name implies, largely upon ants, though perhaps less extensively so 

 than has been supposed; it having been stated by competent observers 

 that some species subsist more upon various forms of insect life which 

 the immense armies of ants, as they march across the forest floor, 

 startle from their hiding place among the dead leaves, etc., over 

 which they pass. 



Notwithstanding their mesomyodian larynx, many of the Formi- 

 cariidse are good songsters, some of them being conspicuous for their 

 vocal powers. 



The classification of this group is very difficult, more so probably 

 than in the case of any other American family of birds. Indeed it 

 may be truly said that even the most recent attempts to present an 

 orderly and natural sequence of the genera are very far from satis- 

 factory. My effort to bring order out of chaos can be considered as 

 only partially successful, but it is hoped that some improvement at 

 least has been made in that direction. Undoubtedly better results 

 would have been reached had a better representation of the genera 

 and species been available; but unfortunately there are very many 

 species and several recognized genera which I have not been able to 

 examine in this connection. As in the case of many other groups, 

 the segregation of the species into genera has been based far too 

 much on general resemblance, and too little attention paid to struc- 

 tural characters. This may be said of nearly every group of birds; 

 but in the present instance it is difficult to understand how certain 

 associations could have been made.

° In order to show more clearly the relationship of the various groups, a number of 

 extralimital (South American) genera are included. My efforts have been handi- 

 capped by the lack of many species desired for comparison, among which are the 

 types of the following generic or subgeneric names:

 which are larger, of quadrate form, and extend around the posterior 

 margin, the outer series much smaller, longitudinal, and irregularly 

 hexagonal or elliptical; middle toe, with claw, much shorter than 

 tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to beyond middle of sub- 

 terminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly but slightly 

 shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe but much stouter; middle 

 toe united to outer toe by whole of its basal phalanx, to inner toe by 

 more than half its basal phalanx; claws moderately curved, rather 

 blunt, much compressed. Plumage blended, rather lax, especially 

 on rump; feathers of pileum moderately developed, not forming a 

 distinct crest.

 of body), the wing-coverts with white terminal dots, the lateral 

 rectrices narrowly tipped with white; adult female gray or olive, 

 narrowly streaked with whitish.

The very large series of Mexican and Central American birds examined in this 

 connection shows very clearly the absence of anything like corellation between 

 geographic distribution and the coloration of the under tail-coverts, and, therefore, 

 in the absence of other characters (that I can discern) I am forced to recognize a 

 single form only.

 beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner 

 toe decidedly shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe but much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly united to outer toe, 

 united for about half its length to inner toe ; claws strongly curved, 

 much compressed, that of the hallux decidedly shorter than its digit. 

 Plumage full, lax, and blended, that of the rump much lengthened 

 and fluffy; feathers of pileum elongated, especially on occiput, 

 forming a distinct decumbent crest.

Medium-sized Formicariidse (length about 150-160 mm.) with bill 

 much shorter than head, not compressed, its terminal unguis small; 

 adult males with under parts (usually upper parts also) conspicu- 

 ously barred with black and white, or (in T. virgatus) dull slate-gray 

 streaked with whitish; adult females and young tawny or rufous 

 above, ochraceous or buff below. d 



Bill much shorter than head (exposed culmen shorter than middle 

 toe with claw), broader than deep at frontal antise, where its width 

 is equal to much more than half the distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla; culmen broad, indistinctly ridged, slightly convex from

near base, more strongly decurved terminally, the tip of mandible 

 distinctly but not strongly uncinate; maxillary tomium faintly con- 

 cave, distinctly notched subterminally; mandibular tomium nearly 

 straight, minutely but distinctly notched and toothed subterminally, 

 the tip of mandible acute, recurved; gonys moderately convex, 

 ascending terminally, rather prominent basally. Nostril exposed, 

 broadly longitudinally oval, with the internal tubercle barely visible 

 in upper posterior portion. Bictal bristles present but very small, 

 shorter than the terminal setse to feathers of chin. Wing moderate, 

 with longest primaries projecting slightly but decidedly beyond 

 secondaries; fifth and sixth primaries longest, the seventh but little 

 shorter; tenth (outermost) about three-fifths as long as longest, the 

 ninth shorter than secondaries. Tail about as long as wing (at least 

 five-sixths as long), much rounded (graduation equal to or exceeding 

 length of exposed culmen), the retrices (12) moderately broad, 

 rounded terminally. Tarsus equal to or longer than commissure, 

 about one-third as .long as wing, distinctly scutellate, the plantar 

 scutella in two longitudinal series, elongate-quadrate or lozenge 

 shaped; middle toe, with claw, much shorter than tarsus (toe alone 

 shorter than exposed culmen); outer toe, without claw, reaching to 

 or a little beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the 

 inner toe a little shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe, but much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly united to outer toe, 

 united to inner toe for about half its length; claws moderate in size

 age" full, lax, and blended, that of the rump elongated, fluffy ; feathers 

 of crown and occiput (especially the latter) elongated, distinctly 

 outlined, forming a distinct but not conspicuous decumbent crest. 



Coloration. — Adult males with under parts (usually the upper 

 also) conspicuously barred with black and white, or else (in T. 

 virgatus) dull slate-gray, streaked with whitish: adult females and 

 young tawny or rufescent above, ochraceous or buffy below.

THAMNOPHILUS RADIATUS NIGRICRISTATUS (Lawrence). 



BLACK-CRESTED ANTSHRIKE. 



Similar to T. doliatus and its subspecies a but adult males with 

 elongated feathers of pileum entirely black. Still more like T. radiatus 

 radiatus b but coloration darker, in both sexes. 



Adult male. — Pileum, except sides of occiput (supra-auricular region) 

 and more or less of forehead, uniform black (without concealed white, 

 except, sometimes, a very little on the occiput); rest of upper parts 

 black barred, more or less broadly, with white, the white bars never 

 as wide as the black interspaces, sometimes reduced to transverse 

 spots; forehead usually more or less (sometimes extensively) streaked 

 with white; sides of occiput (supra-auricular region), streaked with 

 black and white, the black streaks usually broader than the white 

 ones; auricular and malar regions and sides of neck similarly streaked, 

 but the black streaks rather narrower; under parts white, the chin 

 and throat usually streaked (sometimes broadly) with black, the 

 remaining under parts (except, sometimes, abdomen) barred with 

 black, the black bars usually much narrower than the white inter- 

 spaces but sometimes nearly as broad, especially on flanks; maxilla 

 blackish, paler on tomium; mandible grayish (sometimes whitish ter- 

 minally and on tomium), bluish gray in life; iris straw color; legs and 

 feet dusky (bluish gray in life?); length (skins), 138-158 (149); 

 wing, 67.5-72 (70.2); tail, 54-61 (56.8); culmen, 17-19.5 (18.3); 

 tarsus, 26-27.5 (26.7); middle toe, 14.5-17 (16.4) . d 



Adult female. — Pileum deep chestnut, becoming paler (more tawny) 

 on forehead; hindneck broadly streaked with black and ochraceous 

 or tawny; wings and tail uniform deep cinnamon-rufous or chestnut- 

 rufous, the back, scapulars, and rump similar but usually lighter 

 and more tawny-rufous; sides of head (including supra-auricular 

 region) buffy whitish, buffy, ochraceous, or pale tawny, streaked 

 (except on lores) with black, th© black streaks broader on supra- 

 auricular region, narrower (sometimes nearly obsolete) on anterior 

 portion of malar region; chin and throat immaculate, very pale buffy 



« The individual variation in this form seems to include as great extremes of 

 coloration, as regards relative width of black and white bars in the adult male 

 and intensity of coloration in the female, as is covered by the geographic variations in 

 T. doliatus! 



b Thamnophilus radiatus Vieillot, Nouv. Diet. d'Hist. Nat., iii, 1816, 315; Sclater, 

 Cat. Birds Brit. Myiarchuss., xv, 1890, 210. Several subspecies have been described, but 

 I have not been able to secure sufficient material to enable me to characterize 

 them satisfactorily. They are involved in much confusion and require careful 

 revision.

 (skins), 134-155 (147); wing, 67-71 (68.6); tail, 54-59 (56.3) ; culmen, 

 17-20 (18.7); tarsus, 25-27 (26.1); middle toe, 15-16.5 (15.8).° 



° Eight specimens from Panamd (mainland). 



The series examined from Panamd comprises three adult males in dark, heavily 

 barred plumage, like the type, and ten which are more or less decidedly lighter in 

 color, some of them indistinguishable, so far as I am able to see, from Colombian 

 examples labeled Thamnophilus albicans. In fact, unless there are two forms of the 

 species in Panama^ which is hardly probable, the individual variation in this species 

 is much greater than in T. doliatus, which is reasonably constant within definite 

 geographic areas. At present I have neither the material nor time necessary for 

 more satisfactorily working out the problem, which, judging from the material 

 examined, is a very complicated one. 



The following measurements of specimens belonging to the radiatus group are given 

 below for comparison with those of Panamd, examples:

Adult male. — Above black, the forehead spotted or streaked, more 

 or less, with white, the elongated feathers of crown white (mostly 

 concealed) with a large apical guttate spot of black, the remaining 

 upper parts barred with white (the white bars always much less than 

 half as wide as the black interspaces), the white bars on rectrices and 

 tertials not reaching to shaft (except terminal bar on tertials) ; sides 

 of head, chin, and throat streaked with black and white, the first

 on forehead; supra-auricular region, hindneck and sides of neck 

 light ochraceous or buffy (sometimes buffy whitish on sides of neck),

BARRED-CRESTED ANTSHRIKE. 



Adult male. — Above black, rather narrowly barred with white, the 

 bars on tips of feathers of pileum and hindneck sometimes partaking 

 of the form of spots (a pair on tip of each feather, separated by a rather 

 broad median space of black) ; sides of head, chin, and throat streaked 

 with black and white, the streaks broadest on throat, narrower and 

 confused or intermixed with bars on auricular and suborbital regions ; 

 under parts of body and under tail-coverts conspicuously barred with 

 black and white, the bars of the two colors approximately equal in 

 width, or the white ones wider, at least on the abdomen; maxilla 

 brownish black, the tomium pale horn color (bluish gray in life ?) ; 

 mandible light horn- color, passing into pale yellowish terminally 

 (bluish gray in life?); legs and feet dusky (bluish gray in life?); 

 length (skins), 148-156 (153); wing, 70-75 (72.5); tail, 61-66.5 

 (63.7); culmen, 18-20 (18.4); tarsus, 22.5-25 (23.9); middle toe, 

 14.5-16.5 (15.1).°

 chestnut, somewhat interrupted on hindneck, the back and rump 

 sometimes duller or more tawny and with faint indications of darker 

 bars; sides of head and neck (including sides of hindneck), together 

 with chin and throat, conspicuously streaked with black and white; 

 rest of under parts white, passing into pale tawny brown or fulvous on

Immature male. — Similar to the adult male, but plumage suffused, 

 more or less, with pale fulvous or brownish buff. 



Young (male ?) . — Similar in general coloration to the adult female 

 but pileum mostly black, scapulars, interscapulars, and wing-coverts 

 distinctly barred with dull black, and rump indistinctly barred with

TURBO ANTSHRIKE. 



Adult male. — Head and neck, above and laterally, black, each 

 feather with a conspicuous mesial guttate streak of buffy white; 

 under parts, including chin and throat, dull slate-gray, similarly 

 but more broadly streaked, as far back as the lower abdomen, where 

 the streaks become obsolete and the ground color paler and more 

 buffy gray; under tail-coverts cinnamon with narrow shaft-streaks 

 of paler; thighs deeper cinnamon, or russet; under wing-coverts and 

 broad edgings to inner webs of primaries deep cinnamon-buff; back 

 and scapulars tawny-chestnut, changing on rump to a paler and 

 duller, more fulvous, hue; wings "and tail clear chestnut; length 

 (skin), about 1.45; wing, 75; tail, 57; exposed culmen (tip of bill 

 broken off); tarsus, 25; middle toe, 15. 



Northwestern Colombia (Turbo), near eastern extremity of Isthmus 

 of Panama. 



This very distinct species is very unlike any other known to me. 

 It is about the size of T. palliatus (Lichtenstein), and has the back, 

 wings, and tail similar in color, but has the pileum, hindneck, and 

 under parts conspicuously streaked with white instead of having the 

 pileum plain black and under parts barred with white, the ground 

 color of the under parts moreover being gray instead of black. There 

 is a closer resemblance in coloration to Berlepschia rikeri (belonging 



a According to Sclater, Cat. Birds Brit. Myiarchuss., xv, 1890, 211. I have seen only Colom- 

 bian examples, however, and the species is omitted from the Biologia Centrali- 

 Americana. 



6 The type of Thamnophilus tenuifasciatus has been carefully examined and com- 

 pared with specimens of T. multistriatus, with the result that it proves to be very 

 distinct from the latter. If not a synonym of T. tenuipunctatus Lafresnaye (which 1 

 have not seen) it must stand as a distinct form.

Genus ERIONOTUS Cabanis and Heine. 



Erionotus ° Cabanis and Heine, Myiarchuss. Hem., ii, Aug., 1859, 15. (Type, Thamno- 

 philus cserulescens Vieillot.) 



Medium-sized or rather small Formicariidae (length about 140-150 

 mm.), with bill more compressed than in ThamnopJiilus and coloration 

 very different, the plumage without bars, either above or below. 



Bill variable in size (nearly as long to only about half as long as 

 head), its width at frontal antiae not greater than its height at same 

 point and equal to less than one-half to decidedly more than one- 

 half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen slightly to 

 distinctly ridged, nearby straight for most of its length, strongly 

 decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla distinctly (sometimes strongly) 

 uncinate; maxillary tomium straight, slightly but distinctly notched 

 subterminally; mandibular tomium straight, slightly but distinctly 

 notched and toothed subterminally, the tip of the mandible forming 

 a small but distinct recurved point; gonys moderately convex (more 

 strongly so basally), recurved terminally. Nostril exposed (but pos- 

 teriorly in contact with feathering of the latero-frontal antiae), oval 

 or roundish, without operculum, with the interior tubercle slightly 

 visible in posterior portion. Rictal bristles present but minute (prac- 

 tically obsolete) ; feathers of chin, malar and frontal antiae, and lores, 

 with distinct terminal setae. Wing moderate or rather large, with 

 longest primaries decidedly longer than secondaries; fourth, fifth, and 

 sixth, or fifth, sixth, and seventh primaries longest and equal (or the 

 fifth slightly longer than fourth, the latter equal to sixth), the tenth 

 (outermost) about three-fifths as long as the longest, the ninth equal 

 to or shorter than secondaries. Tail four-fifths to more than five- 

 sixths as long as wing, much rounded (graduation less than length of 

 middle toe without claw), the rectrices (12) moderately broad or 

 rather narrow, rounded terminally. Tarsus longer (sometimes much 

 longer) than exposed culmen, one-third as long as wing or a little 

 less, distinctly scutellate, the plantar scutella in two longitudinal

series, that on outer side sometimes indistinct, especially on upper 

 portion; middle toe, with claw, much shorter than tarsus; outer toe, 

 without claw, reaching to or slightly beyond middle of subterminal 

 phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux about 

 as long as inner toe but much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe 

 wholly united to outer toe, for about half its length to inner toe; 

 claws moderate in size and curvature, that of the hallux decidedly 

 shorter than the digit. Plumage full, soft, and blended, that of the 

 rump elongated and lax; feathers of crown and occiput (especially 

 the latter) elongated, forming a more or less distinct decumbent crest 

 of broad, rounded feathers. 



Coloration. — Adult males with pileum, wings, and tail black, the 

 rest of upper parts gray or gray and black, in some species wholly 

 black, except for white concealed patch on back and white wing- 

 spots; back with a large concealed patch of white, the wings and 

 tail with white markings; under parts gray, sometimes whitish on 

 abdomen, etc., sometimes entirely black; adult females brown (some- 

 times partly rufescent) above, with whitish markings on wings and 

 concealed white patch on back, paler brownish or rufescent below. 



Nidification. — Nest pensile, vireo-like; eggs white or creamy white, 

 spotted or streaked with brownish. 



Range. — Honduras to Cayenne and southeastern Brazil. (About 

 twelve species. ) a 



a The type of Erionotus {Thamnophilus cxrulescens Vieillot), together with Thamno- 

 philus melanochrous Sclater and Salvin and probably several others referable to the 

 same group (I have not seen T. tschudii Pelzeln, T. xthiops Sclater, T. cinereo-niger 

 Pelzeln, T. sUllaris Spix, T. tristis Sclater and Salvin, T. capitalis Sclater, nor T. 

 cinereiceps Pelzeln), differs so much in relative size and shape of the bill from T. 

 ambiguus Swainson, T. nsevius (Gmelin), T. gorgonx Thayer and Bangs, and related 

 forms that there is some question as to whether the two groups are really congeneric; 

 indeed, I have placed them together mainly on account of their very close resem- 

 blance to one another in style of coloration. 



Another group, composed of species (referred by Dr. Sclater to the genera Thamno- 

 philus and Dysithamnus) distinguished by their very plain (mainly gray, slate colored 

 or sooty) coloration, without black wings or tail and destitute of white markings on 

 wings and tail or of a distinct white dorsal (concealed) patch, I do not, at present at 

 least, refer to Erionotus. These species ( Thamnophilus murinus Pelzeln, T. simplex 

 Sclater, T. capitalis Sclater, T. inornatus Ridgway, Dysithamnus leucostictus Sclater, 

 Thamnophilus schistaeeus D'Orbigny, Dysithamnus ardesiacus Sclater and Salvin, D. 

 unicolor Sclater, D. plumbea (Myiarchusximilian), and D. subplumbms Sclater and Salvin) 

 differ considerably among themselves in structural details and may represent two or 

 more distinct groups. Since they are all extralimital to the present work, however, 

 I leave them as a problem for others to work out.

 Both very dark and light colored examples occur among specimens from Bogota,

Silvestrius d Bertoni, Aves Nuevas del Paraguay, 1901, 136. (Type, Thamno- 

 philus (Silvestrius) flavescens Bertoni= Myothera mentalis Temminck.) 



Small Formicariidse (length about 100-115 mm.) with bill much 

 shorter than head, tail less than three-fourths as long as wing and 

 slightly rounded, tarsus one-third as long as wing, and plainly colored 

 plumage (olive or olive-greenish above, becoming gray or slate colored 

 on head and neck, the pileum sometimes streaked or spotted with 

 blackish, mostly whitish or yellowish below, sometimes with streaks 

 on throat and chest, females more brownish, with pileum rufescent. 



Bill much shorter than head, its width at frontal antise slightly 

 greater than its depth at same point and equal to about half the dis- 

 tance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly but not 

 sharply ridged, nearly straight for most of its length, strongly and

to rather strongly uncinate; maxillary tomium straight, distinctly 

 notched subterminally ; mandibular tomium nearly straight, minutely 

 toothed and notched subterminally, the tip of mandible forming a short 

 recurved point; gonys gently convex, slightly ascending terminally, 

 not prominent basally. Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with 

 feathering of latero-frontal antise, roundish or broadly oval, its upper- 

 posterior margin membraneous, the interior tubercle visible within 

 posterior portion. Rictal bristles present but minute, the feathers of 

 chin, anterior portion of malar region, and lores with long terminal 

 setse. Wing moderate, with longest primaries extending to decidedly 

 beyond secondaries; sixth and seventh, or fourth, fifth and second, 

 primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) less than three-fifths but 

 more than half as long as the longest, the ninth about equal to or 

 slightly shorter than secondaries. Tail a little more than half to 

 more than two-thirds as long as wing, slightly rounded or nearly 

 even, the rectrices (12) narrow, subrounded or subacuminate ter- 

 minally. Tarsus much longer than exposed culmen, about one-third 

 as long as wing, slender, the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate, the 

 plantar scutella in two longitudinal series, less distinct on outer side ; 

 middle toe, with claw, much shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without 

 claw, reaching to slightly beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of 

 middle toe, the inner toe a little shorter; hallux about as long as 

 inner toe, but much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly 

 united to outer toe, for about half its length to inner toe; claws 

 moderate in size and curvature, that of the hallux decidedly shorter 

 than the digit. Plumage full, soft, and blended, longer and more 

 lax on rump ; pileum not crested. 



Coloration. — Adult males olive or olive-greenish above, the head 

 and neck gray or slate-colored (sometimes streaked or spotted with 

 blackish), the lesser wing-coverts black, spotted with white or with a 

 white area on inner-anterior portion; under parts mostly whitish or 

 yellowish (at least medially), the throat and chest sometimes streaked 

 with gray or blackish. Adult females duller in color, with pileum 

 rufescent. 



Range. — Guatemala to British Guiana, southeastern Brazil, Para- 

 guay, Bolivia, and Peru. (About ten species.) 



°I have not seen D. guttulatus (Lichtenstein), D. tambillanus Taczanowski, D. 

 xanthopterin Burmeister, nor D. flemingi Hartert. All these except D. xanthopterins 

 appear, however, to be congeneric with D. mentalis, etc., so far as I am able to judge 

 from descriptions; but the style of coloration is so different in D. xanthopterins (chest- 

 nut-rufous wings and lower back, white spots on sides of head, etc.) that I doubt its 

 close relationship. 



D. leucostictus Sclater, D. schistaceus (D'Orbigny), D. ardesiacus Sclater and Salvin, 

 D. unicolor Sclater, and D. subplumbew Sclater and Salvin, I unhesitatingly exclude, 

 as being much more nearly related to the genus Erionotus Cabanis and Heine (= Tham- 

 nophilus, part, of Sclater). 



D. plumbeus (Myiarchusximilian) I have seen but have not now at hand, and therefore 

 can not verify my impression that it is congeneric with D. mentalis and allies.

 internal tubercle visible within the posterior half. Rictal bristles 

 present but minute. Wing moderate, with longest primaries extend- 

 ing decidedly beyond secondaries; sixth and seventh, fifth, sixth, 

 and seventh, or sixth, seventh, and eighth, primaries longest, the 

 tenth (outermost) more than half to about three-fifths as long as 

 the longest, the ninth shorter than secondaries. Tail decidedly less 

 than half as long as wing (M. pygmxa) to slightly more than half as 

 long, very slightly to decidedly rounded, tbe rectrices (10 in M. 

 pygmxa and M. cinereiventris? , a 12 in M. surinamensis and M. 

 assimilis) rather narrow, rounded terminally. Tarsus much longer 

 than exposed culmen, much shorter than tail and about one-third 

 as long as wing in M. surinamensis, very much shorter than tail and 

 decidedly less than one-third as long as wing in M. cinereiventris and

 as long as wing in M. pygmxa, distinctly scutellate, the plantar 

 scutella in two longitudinal series; middle toe, with claw, much 

 shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to beyond 

 middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly

 phalanx of middle toe wholly united to outer toe, for about half its 

 length to inner toe; claws moderate in size and curvature, that of 

 the hallux much shorter than the digit. Plumage soft and full, that 

 of the rump much developed and fluffy; pileum not crested. 



Coloration. — Adult males black above, conspicuously streaked 

 with white, the wing with two broad white bands, or else plain gray 

 or slate color above, with small white tips to wing-coverts, the tail 

 with white terminal spots; the under parts white streaked with black 

 (M. surinamensis) or immaculate pale yellow (M. pygmsea), or plain 

 gray or slate color (M. cinereiventris and M. assimilis) ; adult females 

 with head and neck tawny or cinnamomeous, streaked with black 

 above, otherwise much like adult males, or else with under parts 

 cinnamomeous. 6 



Nidification. — Nest made of fine roots and grass and suspended 

 in a fork; eggs white or greenish-white. 



" According to Dr. Sclater M. pygmxa has only 10 rectrices, and a specimen of 

 M. cinereiventris apparently has only 10.

Small Formicariidae resembling Myrmotherula but differing in 

 relatively much, longer tail (much more than half to more than two- 

 thirds as long as wing), much stouter and relatively shorter and less 

 depressed bill, the adult males neither streaked nor plain gray or 

 slaty. 



Bill decidedly shorter than head, rather stout, not depressed 

 basally, its width at frontal antiae about equal to or very little greater 

 than its depth at same point and equal to less to slightly more than 

 half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly 

 and rather sharply ridged, straight or nearly so for most of its length, 

 rather strongly and abruptly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla 

 minutely but distinctly uncinate; tomium nearly straight, that of 

 maxilla distinctly, that of mandible slightly notched subterminally; 

 gonys faintly convex (more decidedly so basally). Nostril exposed, 

 posteriorly nearly (sometimes quite) in contact with feathering of 

 latero-frontal antiae, roundish or broadly oval, margined for basal 

 half by the membraneous cover of nasal fossae (this sometimes extend- 

 ing along upper margin as a narrow "operculum"), and with a con- 

 spicuous internal tubercle. Rictal bristles present but minute 

 (practically obsolete); feathers of chin, malar antiae, and lores with 

 slender terminal setae. Wing moderate, with longest primaries dis- 

 tinctly longer than secondaries; sixth and seventh, or fifth, sixth, 

 and seventh, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) slightly more 

 than one-half to nearly two-thirds as long as the longest, the ninth 

 about as long as secondaries or a little shorter. Tail much more 

 than half to more than two-thirds as long as wing, much rounded, 

 the rectrices (12) moderately broad to rather narrow, rounded ter- 

 minally. Tarsus decidedly longer than exposed culmen, less than 

 one-third as long as wing (except in M. ornata), the acrotarsium 

 distinctly scutellate, the planta tarsi usually fused (at least in part) 

 or with the scutella somewhat indefinite as to form and arrangement 

 (with a general tendency toward two longitudinal series); middle 

 toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without 

 claw, reaching to beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle 

 toe, the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe 

 but much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly united to 

 outer toe, for about half its length to inner toe; claws moderate in 

 size and curvature, that of the hallux decidedly shorter than the 

 digit. Plumage soft, lax, and blended, that of rump and flanks 

 much elongated and fluffy; feathers of pileum not elongated. 



Coloration. 0, — Adult males plain gray or slate color above, the 

 wings black, spotted with white, the tail black with white tip to 



o Not having been able to examine much the greater number of the species referred 

 by Dr. Sclater to Myrmotherula (see note on page 62) I am not able to define the 

 full range of variation as to coloration in this group.

Similar to M. menetriesii D'Orbigny ( ?)° but tail much longer (both 

 absolutely and relatively) ; adult male with wing-coverts much darker, 

 the lesser and middle coverts being wholly black (except for the white 

 terminal spots), instead of slate color with black subterminal area, 

 and inner-anterior portion of lesser wing-covert area much less 

 extensively white. 



Adult male. — Above mainly uniform slate color; wing-coverts, 

 which are black, each tipped with a transversely subtriangular or 

 subrounded spot of white; primary coverts and alula also black, the 

 former with a small white mark at tip of outer web, the latter termi- 

 nally margined with white; a white patch (mostly concealed) at 

 junction of wing and body; chin, throat, and chest (sometimes breast 

 also, at least medially) uniform black; malar region black, barred 

 with slate-gray; sides of head and neck, together with lateral and 

 posterior under parts, uniform slate color, except under tail-coverts, 

 which are margined terminally with white and barred subterminally 

 with black; under wing-coverts mixed white and blackish; inner 

 webs of remiges broadly edged with brownish white; bill black; iris 

 brown; legs and feet grayish, horn color, or dusky (bluish gray or

Adult female. — Pileum and hindneck plain buffy olive-brown or 

 raw umber; the back, scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts 

 lighter and less brownish olive; tail deep brown (sepia), the edges of 

 the rectrices brighter, more russet brown; general color of wings olive, 

 the tips of wing-coverts (broadly but indistinctly) more cinnamon- 

 brownish; sides of head, chin, and throat buffy, the former more or 

 less suffused with olive or olive-brown; rest of under parts tawny- 

 buff or clay color, deeper and browner, or tinged with olivaceous, on 

 sides and flanks; under wing-coverts deep buff or tawny-buff; inner 

 webs of remiges broadly edged with paler buff; maxilla horn brown 

 or dusky with paler tomium, mandible pale dull yellowish (grayish blue 

 to flesh color in life) ; legs and feet light horn color (bluish gray or

Immature male. — Precisely like the adult female in coloration. 

 (Older specimens show more or less of black on the throat, the lateral 

 portion of which, together with more or less of sides of head, are 

 slate-gray.) 



Young male {first plumage) . — Similar to the adult female but back 

 tinged with dark purplish brown, and under parts of body clouded with 

 dark purplish brown (seal brown or dark chocolate), the chest nearly

« While the only specimen from a locality south of Colombia seen by me is cer- 

 tainly not the same as the Colombian and Central American form, Hellmayr says 

 (Verh. k. k. Zool.-bot. Ges. Wien, 1903, 211) that the latter extends as far as soutli- 

 eastern Peru. It would therefore appear that two forms occur in Ecuaddr and Peru.

 peculiarities of specimens from northern Peru are discussed.)

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 75 



Genus MICRORHOPIAS Selater. 



Myiarchuscrorhopias Sclater, Cat. Am. Birds., 1862, 182. (Type, Thamnophilus quixen- 

 sis Cornalia.) 



Small to very small Formicariidse (length, about 105-135 mm.) 

 with long, graduated tail of 12 round-tipped rectrices (nearly as long 

 as to longer than wing), tarsus much less than half as long as wing, 

 nostril broadly oval (much broader than the narrow, sometimes 

 nearly obsolete, operculum), the adult males with at least the chin, 

 throat, chest, and median portion of breast black, and wing-coverts 

 tipped with white. 



Bill shorter than head, moderately stout, not compressed, its width 

 at frontal antise little if any greater than its depth at same point and 

 equal to about half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen 

 distinctly but not sharply ridged, nearly straight for basal half (more 

 or less) more and more decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla slightly 

 though distinctly uncinate; tomia straight or nearly so, distinctly 

 notched subterminally, the notch near tip of mandibular tomium less 

 distinct; gonys gently convex, less so terminally. Nostril exposed, 

 longitudinally oval, nearly in contact with feathering of latero-frontal 

 antise, the superior operculum very narrow or practically obsolete. 

 Eictal bristles well developed in M. boucardi and M. consobrina, a 

 very minute (practically obsolete) in M. intermedia, M. grisea, M. 

 rufatra, and allies; feathers of chin and loral region with slender 

 terminal setae. Wing moderate, with longest primaries extending, 

 more or less decidedly, beyond secondaries; fifth and sixth, sixth and 

 seventh, or fifth, sixth and seventh, primaries longest, the tenth 

 (outermost) one-half to three-fifths as long as the longest, the ninth 

 shorter than secondaries. Tail nearly as long as to longer than wing, 

 graduated (graduation equal to length of tarsus or more), the rectrices 

 (12) rather broad, rounded terminally. Tarsus longer than whole 

 culmen, one-third (M. boucardi, M. consobrinus) to two-fifths as long 

 as wing (M. grisea, M. intermedia, M. rufatra), distinctly scutellate, 

 the plantar scutella in two longitudinal series but sometimes partly 

 fused or obsolete; middle toe, with claw, much shorter than tarsus; 

 outer toe, without claw, reaching to slightly beyond middle of sub- 

 terminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux 

 about as long as inner toe but much stouter; basal phalanx of middle 

 toe wholly united to outer toe, for about half its length to inner toe; 

 claws moderate in size and curvature, that of the hallux decidedly 

 shorter than its digit. Plumage full, lax, and blended, that of the 

 rump and flanks elongated and more fluffy; feathers of pileum not 

 elongated. 



° Probably also in the closely related M. quixensis and M. bicolor, which, however, 

 I have not seen. 




76 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



Coloration. — (I.) Adult males black with white spots on wing- 

 coverts, white tips to rectrices (or lateral rectrices mostly white), 

 and interscapulars pure white basally; adult females slate color or 

 blackish above, with white markings as in adult males, under parts 

 cinnamon-rufous or chestnut. (II.) Adult males brownish gray, 

 brown, or rufescent above, the wing-coverts black with terminal 

 white spots, the lateral rectrices also tipped with white; chin, throat, 

 chest, and median portion of breast (sometimes abdomen also) black, 

 the sides and flanks whitish, grayish or fulvous; adult females similar 

 but without black on under parts. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Cayenne, southeastern Brazil, Bolivia, 

 and Peru. (About seven species.)" 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF MICItORHOPIAS . 



a. Upper parts black, the feathers of back pure white basally. (Myiarchuscrorhopias bow- 

 cardi.) 

 6. White tips to lateral rectrices smaller (5-7 mm. long on outermost rectrix). 

 c. Flanks usually slate color. (Southeastern Mexico to Honduras.) 



Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi boucardi, adult male (p. 78). 

 cc. Planks usually black. (Nicaragua to Panama.) 



Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi virgata, adult male (p. 79). 

 66. White tip to lateral rectrices larger (9-12 mm., or more, long on outermost 

 pair). (Colombia to Cayenne and western Ecuad6r.) 



Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi consobrina, adult male (p. 80). 

 aa. Upper parts not black. 

 6. Feathers of back abruptly pure white basally; under parts wholly tawny or 

 chestnut. (Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi.) 

 c. White tip to lateral rectrices smaller (about 5-7 mm. long on outermost rec- 

 trix) ; under parts lighter than chestnut, upper parts more grayish slaty. 

 d. Under parts tawny. . .Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi boucardi, adult female (p. 78). 

 dd. Under parts deep cinnamon-rufous or rufous-chestnut. 



Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi virgata, adult female (p. 80). 

 cc. White tip to lateral rectrices larger (10-15 mm. long on outermost rectrix); 

 under parts deep chestnut, upper parts more blackish slaty. 



Myiarchuscrorhopias boucardi consobrina, adult female (p. 80). 

 66. Feathers of back not white basally; under parts not tawny or chestnut. ( Myiarchuscro- 

 rhopias grisea.) 

 c. Sides of head, throat, chest, and breast uniform black. (Adult males.) 

 d. General color of upper parts darker (deep grayish sepia or purplish brownish 

 slate color). 



o I am very doubtful whether the group comprising Turdus griseus Boddaert, Formi- 

 civora intermedia Cabanis, and Thamnophilus rufater Lafresnaye and D'Orbigny should 

 be included in this genus, for apart from the very different style of coloration, these 

 species differ from Myiarchuscrorhopias proper in obsolete instead of conspicuously developed 

 rictal bristles, much longer tarsus, and some other less marked characters.

Young male (nestling). — Above plain sooty blackish or blackish 

 brown (nearly clove brown), rather lighter (dark sepia) on head, the 

 wings and tail nearly black; greater wing-coverts rather broadly 

 tipped with white but with a narrow terminal margin of dusky; 

 rectrices (except middle pair) tipped with white, as in adults; under 

 parts plain dark sooty brown, tinged with chestnut-brown or vandyke 

 brown.

MICRORHOPIAS BOUCARDI VTRGATA (Lawrence). 



PANAMA ANTWREN. 



Similar to M. b. boucardi but adult male more intensely and 

 extensively black (even the sides and flanks usually black or slate- 

 black), the adult female with color of under parts much darker 

 (rufous-chestnut instead of rufous-tawny) and upper parts darker. 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 96-113 (106); wing, 47.5-51 (49.5); 

 tail, 40-49 (45.9); culmen, 13-14.5 (13.8); tarsus, 15-16 (15.7); 

 middle toe, 8.5-9.5 (8.9) . b 



o A few specimens from Nicaragua and Costa Rica have the flanks slate color, 

 much as in northern examples [M. b. boucardi), but all of the females seen from 

 Costa Rica belong unmistakably to the Panama form. (I have not seen any females 

 from Nicaragua.) 



The white mesial streaks showing on the adult male described by Myiarchus. Lawrence 

 (and on which the name virgata was based) are an individual peculiarity, which I 

 do not find repeated in any other specimen examined, even from Panama. 



This form is distinctly intermediate in coloration between M. b. boucardi and 

 M. b. consobrina of Colombia and Ecuad6r,

Small Formicariidse (length about 90-100 mm.) with long tail, 

 slender bill, no trace of rictal bristles, and bright coloration. 



"This little group leads away from Formicivora [i. e. Myiarchuscrorhopias] 

 to Psilorhamphus and Khamphocsenus. The bill is hardly longer than 

 in Formicivora, but smaller; the nostrils are more elongated, and 

 have a slight membraneous operculum as in PsilorTiamphus. The 

 tail is rather long, thin, and delicate; the tarsi are more like those 

 of Formicivora, and show the divisions of the scutes." 1 * 



' ' Terenura is a peculiar genus of doubtful affinities, but remarkable 

 for the bright colours of its members. These colours (black, bright 

 yellow, chestnut, and olive), it is true, are all to be found in different 

 species of Formicariidse, but in Terenura alone are they associated 

 in a single bird. 



"Cabanis and Heine, who founded the genus, placed it between 

 BampJiocsenus and Ellipura (—Formicivora), and in this position it 

 was left by Myiarchus. Sclater. We can not see that it has much in common 

 with either of these forms, which, different as they are, both possess 

 well-defined rictal bristles, not a trace of which can we see in Terenura. 

 Myiarchus. Sclater speaks of the presence in the latter genus o'f a slightly 

 membraneous nasal operculum such as is found in BhampJwcsenus, 

 but the specimens of Terenura callinota before us have open nostrils 

 without any overhanging membrane.

"On the whole, and in the absence of any information as to the 

 habits of any species of Terenura, we are inclined to place the genus 

 near Myrmofherula, notwithstanding the difference of coloration and 

 the much longer tail. 



"The bill is longer than that of Myrmotherula surinamensis, but is 

 otherwise very similar. The wings are decidedly longer and less 

 rounded. The tarsi are covered behind with large scutella, the 

 sutures of which are, however, rather indefinite. 



"Four or five species constitute the genus Terenura, all more or less 

 rare birds. These are distributed over a wide area of Tropical 

 America — one or two in Southeastern Brazil, one in Guiana, one in 

 Eastern Ecuador, and T. callinota, a western and northwestern bird

Genus MICROBATES Selater and Salvin. 



Myiarchuscrohms a Sclateb and Salvin, Nom. Av. Neotr., 1873, 155. (Type, M. tor- 

 qualus Selater and Salvin =Rhampkocsenus collaris Pelzeln.) 



Very small, long-billed, long-legged Formicariidse, similar in appear- 

 ance to Ramphocsenus but with shorter and broader bill, longer tarsi, 

 relatively longer toes (especially the hallux), narrower nostrils with 

 differently shaped operculum, and much shorter tail (only about half, 

 instead of four-fifths) as long as wing. 



Bill about as long as head, nearly straight, its width at latero- 

 frontal antise much greater than its depth at same point and equal 

 to much more than one-third the distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla; culmen sharply ridged, straight for basal half (more or less), 

 then very gradually decurved until near end, where more strongly 

 decurved, the tip of maxilla minutely but distinctly uncinate; max- 

 illary tomium faintly concave, minutely notched subterminally; 

 mandibular tomium very faintly convex, at- least terminally, without 

 trace of subterminal notch; gonys faintly convex basally, straight 

 terminally. Nostril exposed, distinctly separated from feathering of 

 latero-frontal antise, narrow, longitudinal (slit-like), overhung by a 

 broad but not convex membraneous operculum. Eictal bristles 

 distinct but rather few and slender; feathers of chin without terminal 

 setse. Wing rather large, with longest primaries extending slightly 

 beyond secondaries, much rounded ; fifth and sixth primaries longest, 

 the tenth (outermost) less than half as long as the longest, the ninth 

 very much shorter than, the eighth about equal to, secondaries. Tail 

 slightly more than half as long as wing, rounded (graduation equal to 

 much less than half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla), the 

 rectrices (10) rounded at tip. Tarsus very long (decidedly longer 

 than whole culmen, nearly half as long as wing), slender, the acro- 

 tarsium faintly scuteliate, the planta tarsi completely fused; middle 

 toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus (equal to or slightly 

 longer than exposed culmen) ; outer toe, with claw, reaching to about 

 middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly 

 shorter; hallux much longer than inner toe (about as long as outer 

 toe), much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly united to both 

 lateral toes; claws moderate in size and curvature, that of the hallux 

 much shorter than its digit. Plumage full, soft, and blended, that 

 of rump and flanks elongated, more lax or fluffy; feathers of pileum 

 not elongated. 



Coloration. — Above plain brown; sides of head blackish and white, 

 or tawny; beneath white passing into dusky on flanks and under tail- 

 coverts, the chest crossed by a band of black (M. collaris) or under 

 parts of body gray, chest streaked with black and white, and throat 

 white bordered on each side by a black stripe; sexes alike.

CERCOMACRA TYRANNINA CREPERA (Bangs). 

 DUSKY TTRANNINE ANTBIED. 



Similar to C. t. tyrannina but adult male with coloration averaging 

 much darker, the general color of upper parts blackish slate to slate- 

 black, under parts slate color to blackish slate; adult female and 

 young male not always distinguishable from those of O. t. tyrannina, 

 but usually with color of upper parts darker and more brownish 

 olive, the under parts decidedly deeper tawny. 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 124-148 (137); wing, 60-67 (63.4); 

 tail, 54.5-62.5 (57.2); culmen, 15-18 (16.6); tarsus, 21.5-24 (22.9); 

 middle toe, 12.5-14 (13.5). b 



o There is much variation in intensity of coloration among specimens from Costa 

 Eica and northward. As a rule, specimens from the Caribbean slope are much darker 

 than those from the Pacific side, and were the differences strictly geographical two 

 well-marked forms could easily be made out; but unfortunately both slate-colored 

 and blackish examples sometimes occur in the same locality, as in eastern Nicaragua 

 (Rio Escondido), Honduras (Rio Blanco and San Pedro Sula), while extreme dark 

 specimens come from Bebedero, northwestern Costa Rica, and light colored ones 

 from British Honduras. A large majority of the specimens from southwestern Costa 

 Rica are so light colored that they could almost be referred to true C. tyrannina; but 

 much darker ones occasionally occur there also. Specimens from Venezuela agree 

 exactly with those from Bogotd and Panama; but two adult males from Reyes and 

 Myiarchuspiri, Bolivia, respectively, are quite as dark as the darkest examples of C. t. 

 crepera. On the whole, I consider our present understanding of this species, with 

 reference to its geographic variations, far from satisfactory.

 greater than length of culmen), the rectrices (12) broad, rounded 

 terminally. Tarsus about two-fifths as long as wing, rather slender, 

 the acrotarsium distinctly scutellate, the planta fused (sometimes 

 indistinctly scutellate on outer side); middle toe, with claw, much 

 shorter than tarsus, but decidedly longer than whole culmen; outer 

 toe, without claw, reaching to or slightly beyond middle of subter-

 tomia nearly straight, minutely but distinctly notched subter- 

 minally (more slightly so on mandibular tomium) ; gonys distinctly 

 convex and prominent basally, gently convex or nearly straight and

° I have not seen Thamnophilus leuconotus Spix, referred to Myrmelastes by recent 

 authors. 



I am quite unable to appreciate any reasons for retaining a genus Myrmelastes as 

 distinguished from Myrmeciza, unless the former is restricted to the type {M. plum- 

 beus). The latter differs from other species in much greater development of the 

 plumage of the lower back and rump, stouter bill, more rounded wing, and narrower, 

 more broadly operculate nostrils. On the other hand, M. boucardi and its allies 

 have a longer and more slender bill, longer tail, with relatively narrower rectrices, 

 longer outermost primary, and very different style of coloration. While not so 

 homogeneous as most genera, however, the group, after the elimination of the long- 

 tailed and otherwise very different species constituting the genus Drymophila Swain- 

 son (see page 15), may, on the whole, be considered a fairly natural group.

 Myocincla Swainson, Classif. Birds, ii, 1837, 230. (Type, Turdus colma Gme- 



\m= Formicarius colma Boddaert.) 



Kather large Formicariidse (length about 150-180 mm.) with very 

 dense, compact plumage; bill much shorter than head, depressed 

 basally; short, rounded tail (less than two-thirds as long as the short 

 and concave, rather pointed wing) ; latero-frontal antise with feather- 

 ing short and dense; scutellate tarsi, short anterior claws, and plain 

 coloration. 



Bill shorter than head (exposed culmen about as long as distance 

 from nostril to posterior angle of eye), with straight lateral outlines, 

 slightly depressed basally, its width at latero-frontal antise greater 

 than its depth at same point and equal to half the distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla, or slightly less; culmen distinctly ridged, 

 straight or nearly so for most of its length, decurved terminally, the 

 tip of maxilla inconspicuously and rather obtusely uncinate; max- 

 illary tomium slightly convex posteriorly, straight anteriorly, slightly 

 notched subterminally; mandibular tomium faintly concave pos- 

 teriorly, nearly straight or very faintly convex anteriorly, very 

 indistinctly notched subterminally; gonys decidedly to rather 



a Myiarchus. Carriker erroneously concludes that because six skins of "Myrmeciza immacu- 

 lata (Lafresnaye)" from western Colombia agree closely with Costa Rican specimens 

 of M. zeledoni, the latter is not a tenable form. He quite overlooked the fact 

 that the specimens from western Colombia, which he examined are not Thamno- 

 philus immaculatus of Lafresnaye, which is so different that their confusion would 

 be almost impossible if specimens are actually compared. His observations simply 

 extend the range of M. zeledoni to western Colombia. 




116 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL. MUSEUM. 



strongly convex basally, nearly straight and ascending terminally. 

 Nostril exposed, broadly oval, margined above by narrow membrane, 

 posteriorly in contact with the short and very dense feathering of 

 latero-frontal antise. Rictal bristles present but small; feathers of 

 chin, malar antise, etc., short, without trace of terminal setas. Wing 

 rather short but pointed, very concave beneath, the outer primaries 

 rather strongly arcuate, the longer ones projecting decidedly beyond 

 secondaries; sixth, seventh, or eighth primaries longest, the tenth 

 (outermost) nearly three-fourths as long as the longest, the ninth 

 decidedly longer than secondaries. Tail about three-fifths as long as 

 wing, rounded (graduation less than distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla), the rectrices (12) rather broad and firm, rounded terminally. 

 Tarsus about two and a half times as long as bill from nostril, 

 decidedly less than two-fifths as long as wing, distinctly scutellate, 

 the plantar scutella quadrate, in two longitudinal series; middle toe, 

 with claw, a little more than two-thirds as long as tarsus (longer 

 than commissure) ; outer toe, without claw, reaching to about middle 

 of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe very slightly 

 shorter; hallux much shorter than inner toe, slightly stouter; basal 

 phalanx of middle toe united for more than half its length to outer 

 toe, for less than half its length to inner toe; anterior claws very 

 short, relatively broad, slightly curved; claw of hallux slightly 

 curved, nearly as long as its digit. Plumage compact, dense, that 

 of rump and flanks not elongated nor lax; feathers of pileum not 

 elongated. 



Coloration. — General color uniform brown or blackish (the head 

 sometimes rufescent) above, dusky, grayish, or brownish below, some- 

 times with chest rufescent or tawny, the under tail-coverts usually 

 rufescent and throat black (sometimes margined posteriorly with a 

 narrow band of cinnamon or chestnut) ; inner webs of remiges with 

 basal portion (abruptly) buff, ochraceous, or tawny, the under wing- 

 coverts similar but tipped with black; sexes alike; young similar 

 but throat usually more or less variegated with white. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to western Ecuad6r, Peru, Bolivia, 

 southeastern Brazil, and Cayenne. (About fifteen species and 

 subspecies.) 



This genus is very distinct from any other, its nearest relative 

 being the genus Ghamxza Vigors," of South America, which differs 

 in longer tail (more than two-thirds as long as wing), much greater 

 development of plumage of lower back and rump, different char- 

 acter of feathering of anterior portion of head, shorter and more 

 depressed bill, variegated plumage, and other features.

HOFFMANN'S ANTTHRTJSH. 



Similar to F. m. umbrosus, but under tail-coverts clear tawny or 

 tawny-chestnut (as in F. m. panamensis), and black of throat usually 

 more sharply denned and abruptly contrasted with the dark slate 

 color of chest. Differing from F. m. panamensis in larger size and 

 less brownish coloration." 



Adult male. — Length (skins), 153-173 (163); wing, 90-98.5 (93.5); 

 tail, 51.5-56.5 (54.1); culmen, 19.5-23 (21.2); tarsus, 31.5-34 (33.5); 

 middle toe, 19-21.5 (20.4). 6

 middle toe, 19-20.5 (19.9) . 6 



As in the young of F. m. umbrosus, the young of this form fre- 

 quently have the malar region, chin, and throat white barred or 

 transversely spotted with black. 



a As in F. m. panamensis, there is in this form sometimes a more or less distinct 

 indication of a chestnut or russet collar across the lower throat. Such specimens 

 may be easily distinguished from F. m. moniliger by the very different color of the 

 under tail-coverts (clear tawny or tawny-chestnut instead of light olive-brown and 

 dusky), and much lighter, as well as more extended, color (deep vinaceous-cinnamon 

 to cinnamon-rufous, instead of dull chestnut) of sides of neck and occiput and ter- 

 minal portion of auricular region.

Genus HYLOPHYLAX Ridgway. 



Hylophylaxb Ridgway, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xxii, Apr. 17, 1909, 70. (Type, 

 Conopophaga nsevioides Lafresnaye.) 



Small Formicariidae (length about 100 mm.) with second phalanx 

 of middle toe partly united to outer toe, outstretched feet reaching to 

 beyond tip of tail, tail not more than three-fifths as long as wing, 

 planta tarsi fused (nonscutellate) and acrotarsium indistinctly 

 scutellate. 



Bill shorter than head (sometimes nearly as long), rather stout, 

 rather broad and depressed basally, with straight or (in part) even 

 slightly convex lateral outlines, its width at frontal antise much 

 greater (sometimes twice as great) as its height at same point and 

 equal to from a little less than half to a little more than two-thirds 

 the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly ridged, 

 nearly straight basally (sometimes for most of its length), gradually 

 to rather abruptly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla slightly 

 but distinctly uncinate; maxillary tomium straight or slightly con- 

 cave, minutely but distinctly notched sub terminally; mandibular 

 tomium straight or faintly convex, minutely notched subterminally, 

 the tip of mandible forming a short, more or less recurved, point; 

 gonys more or less strongly convex and prominent basally, more 

 gently convex and more or less decidedly ascending terminally. Nos- 

 tril exposed, more or less widely separated from feathering of latero- 

 frontal antise (nearly in contact with the latter in H. nsevioides), 

 longitudinally ovate, more or less pointed anteriorly, margined above

(at least posteriorly) by an extension of the membraneous integu- 

 ment of the nasal fossae, an internal tubercle or facet visible within 

 the posterior portion. Kictal bristles present, but inconspicuous; 

 feathers of chin, malar antise, and loral region with distinct terminal 

 setae. "Wing moderate or rather large, with longest primaries extend- 

 ing decidedly beyond secondaries; sixth and seventh, or seventh, 

 primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) three-fifths as long as the 

 longest, or slightly more, the ninth equal to or slightly longer than 

 secondaries. Tail slightly more than one-half to three-fifths as long 

 as wing, slightly rounded, the rectrices (12) rather broad, rounded 

 terminally. Tarsus much longer than whole culmen, a little less than 

 two-fifths as long as wing, the acrotarsium indistinctly scutellate 

 (scutella sometimes obsolete except on lower portion), the planta 

 fused, at least for greater part; middle toe, with claw, much shorter 

 than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to about middle of 

 sub terminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter; 

 hallux equal to or slightly longer than inner toe; basal phalanx of 

 middle toe wholly united, the second phalanx partly united, to outer 

 toe (the adhesion involving the first two phalanges of outer toe), 

 united for half its length or more to inner toe; claws rather large, 

 moderately curved, extremely compressed, that of the hallux shorter 

 than the digit (but sometimes nearly as long). Plumage full, soft, 

 and blended, that of rump and flanks more elongated and lax; 

 feathers of pileum not elongated. 



Coloration. — Adult males gray and black above, the back with 

 white spots or lunulate bars, the wing-coverts, tertials, and tail 

 tipped with white; or back rufous or chestnut, with a concealed patch 

 of white, the wing-coverts, tertials, and tail tipped with cinnamon- 

 rufous; throat black, rest of under parts white, passing into gray or 

 bufly on flanks, the chest spotted with black, or whole under parts 

 plain gray. Adult females somewhat like males, but browner above 

 with markings fulvous or bufly instead of white, the throat whitish, 

 and black markings of chest replaced by brownish, or (in slate- 

 colored species) head and under parts rufescent or the general color 

 of under parts gray, with white throat and dusky flanks. 11 



Range. — Costa Eica to western Ecuad6r, Amazon Valley, and 

 Guiana. (Six species. ?) 5 



a On account of insufficiency of material, I am not able to give the full range of color 

 variation in this group. 



t> Of the species referred to the genus Hypocnemis by Dr. Sclater and other recent 

 authors I have seen in this connection only H. cantator (type of the genus), H. paecilo- 

 nota (Cuvier), H. lepidonota Sclater and Salvin, H. leucophrys (Tschudi), H. myio- 

 therina (Spix), S. lugubris (Cabanis and Heine), H. nsevia (Gmelin), and H. nxvioides 

 (Lafresnaye). The second, third, seventh, and eighth of these I have removed from 

 Hypocnemis on account of the very different amount of adhesion of the anterior toes

HYLOPHYLAX N./EVIOIDES (Lafresnaye). 



SPOTTED ANTBIKD. 



Adult male. — Pileum and hindneck grayish brown or olive-brown, 

 passing into gray laterally and on forehead, the feathers usually with 

 darker shaft-streaks and terminal margins; back plain chestnut, the 

 feathers extensively white basally; scapulars, rump, and upper tail- 

 coverts plain russet-brown, the first tinged with chestnut; wing- 

 coverts black, the lesser with terminal spots of white (those along 

 anterior margin mostly white), the middle and greater coverts very 

 broadly tipped with cinnamon-rufous, forming two very conspicuous 

 bands; remiges dull black, the outer web and tip of tertials largely 

 cinnamon (more or less deep) or dull cinnamon-rufous, the sec- 

 ondaries and primaries with outer half or more of outer web light 

 brown or grayish brown; tail grayish brown (deep drab or broccoli 

 brown to sepia), the rectrices tipped with pale cinnamon (some- 

 times whitish on outermost) and crossed by a band (more or less 

 broad) of dull black; sides of head plain dull slate-gray or slate 

 color, like superciliary region and forehead; malar region, chin, and 

 throat uniform black; rest of lower parts white, passing into buffy 

 gray on flanks and pale brownish buff on under tail-coverts, the latter 

 sometimes brownish beneath surface; upper breast and anterior 

 portion of sides heavily spotted with black, separating the immaculate 

 white jugular and pectoral areas; bill black, the mandible sometimes 

 more brownish; legs and feet light horn color (in dried skins); length 

 (skins), 96-113 (106); wing, 61-65.5 (63.1); tail, 32-36 (35); culmen, 

 16-17.5 (16.7); tarsus, 21.5-23 (22.4); middle toe, 13.5-16 (14.5).° 



Adult female. — Above much as in adult male, but pileum and hind- 

 neck decidedly browner (deep broccoli brown to prouts brown), back 

 duller chestnut, rump and upper tail-coverts more rufescent brown, 

 and markings on larger wing-coverts and tertials tawny or ochraceous 

 instead of cinnamon-rufous; under parts very different, however, the 

 chin and throat white or buffy, like chest, upper breast spotted (less 

 heavily) with olive or grayish instead of black, and whole sides and 

 flanks olive or buffy olive; mandible dull whitish (in dried skins); 

 length (skins), 98-114 (108); wing, 59.5-64.5 (62.1); tail, 30-35 



and other excellent structural characters, while the fourth, fifth, and sixth I also 

 remove as a distinct genus, Myrmoborus Cabanis and Heine. (See p. 14.) 



There is much difference in the form of the bill between the three species of Eylo- 

 phylax which I now have before me, H. nxvia having this member very broad and very 

 much depressed basally, while that of H. poecilonota is much narrower, less depressed, 

 and with the base of the gonys more prominent, H. nxvioides being, however, inter- 

 mediate between these extremes.

 c. Forehead and postauricular regions slate color. (Eastern Panama.) 



Anoplops bicolor (p. 132). 

 cc. Forehead and postauricular region brown, like pileum, etc. (Western Pan- 

 ama to eastern Honduras.) Anoplops olivascens (p. 132). 



a A. lunulata (Sclater and Salvin), a species which I have not seen, has black and 

 ochraceous lunulations on the back, and whitish spots on inner webs of rectrices. 



b Of these I have not seen the following: A. lunulata (Sclater and Salvin), A. 

 salvini (Berlepsch), A. griseiventris (Pelzeln), A. cristata (Pelzeln), A. berlepschi Sneth- 

 Iage, A. hoffmannsi Hellmayr, A. pallidas Cherrie, and A. melanosticta (Sclater 

 and Salvin). Anoplops lunulata differs from A. bicolor and its allies in more 

 slender bill, much narrower and more broadly operculate nostrils, and very much 

 denser as well as longer feathering of the loral region. The style of coloration is 

 somewhat different, there being no white on the under parts, the chin and throat 

 being rufous-tawny and the under parts of the body brown. The naked skin on 

 sides of head, together with the legs and feet, are yellow, instead of blue and dusky 

 horn color, respectively, as in A. bicolor, etc.

Genus PH^ENOSTICTUS Ridgway. 



Phxnostictus a Ridgway, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xxii, Apr. 17, 1909, 70. (Type, 

 Phlogopsis mcleannani Lawrence.) 



Medium-sized or rather large Formicariidse (length about 190 mm.) 

 with bill stout and about as long as head, tail nearly as long as wing, 

 tarsal scutella fused, sides of head naked, and with back and under 

 parts conspicuously spotted with black. 



Bill about as long as head, rather stout, moderately compressed 

 terminally, its width at latero-frontal antise decidedly less than its 

 depth at same point; culm en distinctly (almost sharply) ridged, 

 nearly straight for most of its length, or very slightly convex sub- 

 basally, decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla moderately uncinate; 

 maxillary tomium nearly straight, slightly notched subterminally; 

 mandibular tomium straight, minutely notched subterminally; 

 gonys decidedly convex and prominent basally, faintly convex and 

 ascending terminally. Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with 

 thin feathering of latero-frontal antise, broadly oval, margined above 

 by a rather broad extension of the membraneous integument of the 

 nasal fossse, an internal tubercle showing distinctly within posterior 

 portion. Rictal bristles absent, but feathers of loral region with 

 stiffened, bristle-like shafts. Wing moderate or rather large, with 

 longest primaries extending considerably beyond secondaries; sixth, 

 or fifth, sixth and seventh, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) 

 nearly two-thirds as long as the longest, the ninth about as long as 

 secondaries. Tail of 12 rectrices, nearly as long as wing, graduated 

 (graduation equal to length of tarsus or for about two-fifths its length), 

 the rectrices rather narrow, rounded terminally. Tarsus a little more 

 than one-third as long as wing, stout, booted (nonscutellate) ; middle 

 toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without 

 claw, reaching to about middle of subterminal phalanx of middle 



" Oalvo), I display, exhibit; anmbc, marked, spotted.

toe, the inner toe slightly but decidedly shorter; hallux as long as 

 inner toe, much stouter; basal phalanx and half of second phalanx 

 of middle toe united to outer toe, the former united for a little more 

 than half its length to inner toe; claws moderate in size and curva- 

 ture, that of the hallux much shorter than the digit. Plumage full, 

 the scapulars, interscapulars, and feathers of under parts broad, 

 distinctly outlined, and compactly webbed, those of rump and 

 flanks more elongated and lax; feathers of pileum short; loral, sub- 

 orbital, and postocular regions naked, the ear quite exposed; a 

 tuft or spot of short velvety feathers on upper eyelid. 



Coloration. — Pileum grayish brown; throat and chest black; back, 

 scapulars, and wing-coverts olive-brown or tawny-brown with large 

 roundish black spots, the under parts with similar but smaller spots 

 on a more rufescent ground; tail black. 



Range. — Nicaragua to Panama. (Monotypic. a ) 



PH^NOSTICTUS MCLEANNANI MCLEANNANI (Lawrence). 



MC'LEANNAN'S ANTTHKTTSH. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum plain grayish brown (sepia to dark 

 broccoli brown) ; hindneck chestnut or rufous-chestnut; general color 

 of upper parts light olive-brown (between raw-umber and broccoli 

 brown), each feather of back, scapulars, wing-coverts, and tertials 

 very conspicuously marked with a large roundish or transverse 

 broadly elliptical subterminal spot of black, and broadly margined 

 terminally with pale brownish buff or clay color; tail black or 

 brownish black; loral, orbital, and auricular regions unfeathered, 

 except for scattered bristly feathers on the first and a small patch of 

 black feathers immediately above and another beneath eye, the 

 naked skin azure blue in life; malar region, chin, throat, and upper 

 chest uniform black; lower chest deep cinnamon-rufous, the lower 

 chest similar but slightly paler or duller, each feather with a large 

 roundish, subcordate, or broadly elliptical transverse spot of black; 



The genus Phlegopsis Reichenbach (type Myothera nigromaculata Lafresnaye and 

 D'Orbigny), to which the type of Phxnostictus has hitherto been referred, differs 

 conspicuously in shorter and slightly rounded tail (only two-thirds as long as wing, 

 graduated for less than one-seventh its length) of, apparently, only 10 rectrices; very 

 dense, plush-like, feathering of forehead and anterior half of loral region; wholly 

 (and densely) feathered malar region; covered ears; weaker bill, with less sharply 

 ridged culmen and less elevated as well as broadly rounded mesorhinium, and wide, 

 smooth, naked space between nostril and loral feathering. The coloration, too, while 

 somewhat similar is really very different, the head, neck, and under parts being 

 uniform black, the remiges and tail chestnut, the feet black instead of yellow, and 

 the naked skin on sides of head yellow instead of blue (in life). 



1 have not seen Formicarius trivittatus Sclater nor F. erytbropterus Gould, both of 

 which are referred by recent authors to Phlegopsis, but, according to descriptions, 

 these are so different in their style of coloration that the matter of their structural 

 characters should be carefully looked into. 




136 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



breast and abdomen similarly spotted with black, but ground color 

 less rufescent, the feathers broadly margined terminally with buff* 

 or brownish buff; flanks and lower abdomen plain olive-brown; 

 under tail-coverts olive-brown, with a large subterminal spot of 

 blackish and terminally margined with buffy brown or brownish 

 buff; bill black, horn color or brownish at tip; iris brown; legs and 

 feet yellowish (in dried skins — probably pinkish in life). 



Young. — Pileum black, broadly barred with light gray; otherwise 

 essentially like adults, but markings of back, etc., much less regular 

 in form and less sharply contrasted, the feathers broadly tipped or 

 terminally margined with tawny-buff, the under parts much darker, 

 without any jugular area of cinnamon-rufous, the chest being black 

 spotted with brownish tawny or cinnamon.

Medium-sized Formicariidse (length about 130-150 mm.) with 

 planta tarsi broadly rounded (not ridged) behind; tarsus only one- 

 fourth as long as wing; tail only two-fifths as long as wing, nearly

 variegated, with a white or fulvous band across subbasal portion of 

 remiges, and outer web of primaries crossed by an oblique sub- 

 terminal band of buff or" fulvous. 



Bill as long as or longer than head, rather slender, rather broad 

 and depressed basally, its width at loral antise greater than its depth 

 at same point and equal to less than half the distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly ridged (except extreme base, where 

 broad and flattened), straight for most of its length, abruptly 

 decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla moderately uncinate; tomia 

 straight, slightly but distinctly notched subterminally; gonys slightly 

 convex, rather prominent basally. Nostril exposed, separated rather 

 widely from loral feathering, narrow, longitudinal (slit-like) overhung 

 by a rather broad convex operculum. Rictal bristles obsolete, and 

 feathers of chin, malar apex, loral antise, etc., short, without terminal 

 setse. Wing large, very concave beneath, rather pointed, the longest 

 primaries projecting considerably beyond secondaries; sixth and 

 seventh, or sixth, seventh, and eighth primaries longest, the tenth 

 (outermost) three-fourths as long as the longest, the ninth longer 

 than secondaries. Tail very short (only two-fifths as long as wing), 

 nearly even, the rectrices rather narrow, soft, with subacuminate tip. 

 Tarsus shorter than commissure, only one-fourth as long as wing, 

 rather stout, distinctly scutellate, the planta rather broadly rounded 



a The "Fourmillier" of Buffon comprises thirteen species, belonging to eleven 

 recognized genera and four families (Formicariidse, Conopophagidse, Pittidse, and 

 Troglodytidae). So far as I can determine no one has ever fixed a type, and to do so 

 by any other method than the "process of elimination" would involve an amount of 

 time and labor which is not at my disposal. Under the circumstances, I prefer to 

 retain the generic name Rhopoterpe, notwithstanding the unquestioned priority and 

 pertinence of Formicivorus, leaving the final solution of the question to some one who 

 has both the time and taste for such investigation.

 toe, with claw, longer than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, not 

 reaching to middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner 

 toe very slightly shorter; hallux as long as outer toe, but much 

 stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe wholly united to outer toe, for 

 about half its length to inner toe; claws moderate in size and curva-

Adults (sexes alikeV). a — Pileum and hindneck slate color or slate- 

 gray, the feathers margined with black, producing a squamate effect; 

 back, scapulars, and rump olive, the feathers rather broadly mar- 

 gined with black; upper tail-coverts and tail russet-brown to chest- 

 nut; wings olive or olive-brown, the remiges more russet brown, 

 lighter on primaries, the outer of which have their outer webs much 

 paler (nearly wood brown) terminally; greater coverts edged with 

 russet, sometimes (also occasionally the middle coverts) with more 

 or less distinct terminal spots of tawny; lores dull whitish, some- 

 times slightly intermixed with dusky or grayish; a narrow line of 

 white on posterior half (more or less) of upper eyelid; the posterior 

 portion of lower eyelid also whitish; suborbital and auricular regions 

 dark olive with narrow but distinct shaft-streaks of whitish or pale 

 tawny; malar region whitish, buffy or tawny; chin and upper throat 

 olive-brown, suffused, more or less strongly, with tawny-ochraceous, 

 sometimes mixed somewhat with dusky, the feathers with pale 

 ochraceous or buffy shaft-streaks; lower throat tawny or tawny- 

 ochraceous to ochraceous- white, usually immaculate but sometimes 

 more or less broken by dusky spots or bars, usually bounded poste- 

 riorly by a more or less distinct narrow semicircular line of dusky 

 or sooty blackish spots; rest of under parts plain bright tawny or 

 tawny-ochraceous, slightly paler on abdomen, deeper on sides and 

 flanks; under wing-coverts immaculate tawny-ochraceous, the inner 

 webs of remiges broadly edged with a paler tint of same or ochraceous- 

 buff; maxilla dusky horn color, paler toward culmen; mandible 

 pale brownish (in dried skins); legs and feet horn brownish (in 

 dried skins). 



° While considerable variations in color-pattern are observable among specimens 

 of all the forms of this species, in none of them do I find any differences that can 

 be corellated with difference of sex — provided, of course, the latter has in all cases 

 been correctly determined.

 moderate, with longest primaries projecting decidedly beyond sec- 

 ondaries; sixth and seventh, fifth, sixth, and seventh, or fifth and 

 sixth, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) a little less than 

 three-fifths to slightly more than two-thirds as long as the longest,

(English translation, 1889, 122). 



The Furnariidse are closely related to the Dendrocolaptidae and 

 have usually been included in the same family, as Subfamilies Fur- 

 nariinse, Synallaxinse, Philydorinse, and Sclerurinse," 1 three Furnariine 

 genera being even referred to the "Subfamily Dendrocolaptinse. 6 

 Prof. Garrod and Dr. Stejneger, however, have shown c that in their 

 schizorhinal, instead of holorhinal, skull and dissimilar feet they 

 differ sufficiently to warrant their recognition as a distinct family. 



Although distributed throughout the continental portions of the 

 Neotropical Eegion, the Furnariidse are most developed in the Pata- 

 gonian and South-Brazilian Subregions, to which many of the genera, 

 among them the most typical ones, are peculiar, comparatively few 

 of them passing to the northward of the Isthmus of Panama, only 

 25 of the more than 278 species and 10 of the 37 genera d belonging 

 to the Central American district. 



While some of the genera resemble Dendrocolaptine forms in 

 external appearance, and presumably in habits also, the majority of 

 the Furnariidse are more terrestrial; some of them eminently so, and 

 strongly recalling in their appearance and general habits the Larks 

 (Alaudidse) and Stone-chats. Myiarchusny of them inhabit reedy marshes, 

 and bear a superficial likeness to the marsh-wrens (genera Telmato- 

 dytes and Cistoihorus), while certain small long-tailed short-billed 

 forms, as Leptasthenura, recall the Parine genus Psaltriparus, others 

 again resembling Creepers (Certhiidas). 



Myiarchusny of the species, particularly those belonging to the so-called 

 Subfamily Furnariinse, are remarkable for the unusual character of 

 their nests, which, in some cases, consist of massive oven-like struc- 

 tures built of mud or clay, in others immense heaps of twigs, whence 

 the builders have received the name of "fagot-gatherers" from the 

 human inhabitants of the country. 



What has been said concerning the unsatisfactory classification of 

 the Formicariidse e and my efforts to devise a better one applies as 

 well to the present group.

This group unquestionably requires subdivision, but I have not a sufficient repre- 

 sentation of the species to justify an attempt to do so. Besides the type-species I 

 have examined the following: A. humicola (Kittlitz), A. modesta (Eyton), A. anthoides 

 (King), A. wyatti (Sclater and Salvin), A. sulphurifera (Burmeister), A. striaticeps 

 (D'Orbigny and Lafresnaye), and A. maluroides (D'Orbigny and Lafresnaye). The 

 three last are almost certainly distinct generically. Probably nearly related to 

 Asthenes, if not actually belonging to it, are the following species, referred, like the 

 others, to Siptornis by recent authorities: S. orbignii (Reichenbach), 8. arequipse 

 (Sclater and Salvin), S. humiUs (Cabanis), and 5. pudibunda (Sclater). How nearly 

 related may be S. albiceps (Lafresnaye and D'Orbigny) and S. albicapilla (Cabanis) — 

 the former being the type of Cranioleuca Reichenbach (Handb. der Spec. Orn., 1853, 

 167) — I am unable to say, not having seen either.

" Both species of Xenops almost certainly require further subdivision than is here 

 made, but from want of sufficient material, especially of X. rutilus and South American 

 representatives of X. genibarbis, I must leave a satisfactory treatment of the genus 

 to some one who has both more material and time. (See, however, Hellmayr, in 

 Novit. Zool., xiv, 1907, 54, 55, whose paper I did not, unfortunately, see in time 

 to utilize it in this work.)

In the paper referred to above Hellmayr (than whom there is no better authority), 

 divides X. genibarbis into three subspecies (besides X. g. mexicanus), as follows: 

 (1) Xenops genibarbis genibarbis (Colombia to Cayenne and Amazon Valley); (2) 

 Xenops genibarbis littoralis (western Ecuador); (3) Xenops genibarbis pelzelni (south- 

 eastern Brazil, from Bahia to S. Paulo; new subspecies, described on p. 55, the type, 

 in coll. Vienna Myiarchuss., being from Ypanema, S. Paulo).

Specimens from British Honduras are more buffy (less olivaceous) below and 

 more rufescent above than those from Costa Rica, etc., the latter being much more 

 olivaceous (less brownish) below as well as above, than those from Mexico. Those 

 from the Santa Myiarchusrta district of Colombia are paler above, with middle rectrices 

 cinnamomeous rather than rufescent, the under parts paler and grayer, wing shorter, 

 and tail longer. The species almost certainly requires further subdivision.

 slender tip conspicuously protruded. Tarsus very much longer than 

 culmen, at least one-fourth (but less than one-third) as long as wing, 

 distinctly scutellate; middle toe, with claw, as long as tarsus; outer 

 toe, without claw, reaching to much beyond middle of subterminal 

 phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter; hallux as 

 long as outer toe ; middle toe united to outer toe by the whole of its

Genus PREMNOPLEX Cherrie. 



Premnoplex <* Cherrie, Proc. TJ. S. Nat. Myiarchuss., xiv, no. 855, Sept. 4, 1891, 339. 

 (Type, Myiarchusrgarornis brunnescens Lawrence.) 



Small scansorial Furnariidse (length about 135 mm.) with second 

 phalanx of outer toe partly joined to middle toe, tarsus shorter than 

 middle toe with claw, wing less than three and a half times as long 

 as tarsus, exposed culmen as long as middle toe without claw, and 

 inner webs of remiges without any buff or ochraceous area. 



Bill nearly as long as head, slender, its width at loral antise greater 

 than its depth at same point and equal to decidedly less than half 

 the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly ridged, 

 slightly and gradually curved from near base, the tip of maxilla very 

 slightly decurved, not uncinate; tomia nearly straight for terminal 

 half or more but strongly deflected basally, without trace of sub- 

 terminal notch; gonys nearly straight, slightly prominent basally, 

 slightly ascending terminally. Nostril exposed, posteriorly in con- 

 tact with loral feathering, very narrow (a horizontal slit), over- 

 hung by a broad, convex, membraneous operculum. Rictal bristles 

 absent, and feathers of chin, etc., without terminal setse. Wing 

 rather short, excessively rounded, the longest primaries exceeding 

 secondaries by much less than length of exposed culmen; sixth, 

 seventh, and eighth primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) about 

 three-fifths as long as the longest, the ninth much longer than sec- 

 ondaries. Tail about as long as wing, graduated for more than half 

 its length, the rectrices (12) abruptly acuminate, with slender but 

 barbed points conspicuously protruded (but less developed on lateral 

 than on middle rectrices). Tarsus longer than whole culmen, one- 

 third as long as wing, distinctly scutellate; middle toe, with claw, 

 longer than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to about 

 middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe distinctly 

 shorter; hallux as long as outer toe, much stouter; basal phalanx 

 of middle toe wholly united to outer toe, for more than half to inner 

 toe; claws rather large and strongly curved, very acute, that of the 

 hallux much shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above brown, the head darker and duller; throat 

 buff or ochraceous; rest of under parts brown with broad guttate 

 streaks of buff or ochraceous-buff; no buff or ochraceous on inner 

 webs of remiges.

Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum olive or deep grayish olive, the 

 feathers margined with dusky, those of the forehead with rather 

 broad mesial streaks of buff; rest of upper parts mummy brown 

 passing into Vandyke brown on rump and upper tail-coverts, the 

 scapulars and interscapulars indistinctly margined- with dusky, the 

 latter (especially on upper back) sometimes with narrow and mostly 

 indistinct shaft-streaks of buff; tail darker or duller Vandyke brown 

 than rump, sometimes nearly seal brown; loral, superciliary, and 

 supra-auricular regions buff, the latter streaked with dusky; auricu- 

 lar and suborbital regions dusky or dark sooty brown, streaked (the 

 latter spotted or flecked) with buffy; malar region, chin, and throat 

 deep buff, the feathers of throat usually indistinctly margined with 

 blackish; rest of under parts olive, conspicuously variegated with 

 large spots and streaks of light buff and black or dusky margins to 

 the feathers, the former largest on chest, where occupying all of each 

 feather except a broad black margin, narrower, more streak-like on 

 sides, more indistinct on abdomen and flanks, indistinct or obsolete 

 on under tail-coverts; maxilla black, mandible dull whitish or yellow- 

 ish (in dried skins) with a sharply denned stripe of blackish along 

 tomia; iris brown; legs and feet dusky or horn color (in dried 

 skins).

Small wrenlike Furnariidse (length about 130-140 nun.) with tail 

 about as long as wing (sometimes longer), graduated, the rectrices 

 (12) usually acuminate at tip; tarsus much less than one-third as 

 long as wing ; basal phalanx of middle toe not wholly united to outer 

 toe, and tail and wings rufescent and plumage without streaks (ex- 

 cept, sometimes, on pileum) . 



Bill much shorter than head, rather stout, slightly decurved, and 

 moderately compressed, its width at loral antise slightly greater than 

 its depth at same point and equal to about one-third the distance 

 from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly ridged, gradually and 

 rather strongly decurved from near base, the tip of maxilla not 

 uncinate; maxillary tomium more or less distinctly concave, man- 

 dibular tomium similarly convex, both without trace of subterminal 

 notch; gonys nearly to quite straight, not prominent basally. Nos- 

 tril exposed, posteriorly in contact with loral feathering, narrow (a 

 longitudinal slit), overhung by a broad, convex, membraneous oper- 

 culum. Bictal bristles absent, and feathers of chin, etc., without 

 terminal setae. Wing rather large and pointed, the longest primaries 

 exceeding secondaries by about distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; 

 seventh and eighth, sixth, seventh, and eighth, or sixth and seventh 

 primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) about two-thirds as long as 

 the longest, the ninth longer than secondaries. Tail very nearly as 

 long as wing to decidedly longer, graduated for nearly to more than 

 half its length, the rectrices (12) usually abruptly attenuated termi-

 russet brown, cinnamon-rufous of head deeper and more extended 

 (occupying whole of auricular and greater part of malar regions, as 

 well as orbital, loral, superciliary, and supra-auricular regions as well 

 as forehead and crown), general coloration darker, and size larger. 



a On account of the very poor representation of species referred to the genus Siptornis. 

 by Dr. Sclater and other recent authorities, in the material which I have been able to 

 examine, I can not give a very definite statement of the number of species or extent of 

 the geographic range of this genus, which is so exceedingly distinct, structurally, from 

 Siptornis that it is difficult to imagine why the fact has not sooner been realized. The 

 only species examined by me in this connection are the following: A. erythrops 

 (Sclater), A. hellmayri (Bangs), and A. pallida (Myiarchusximilian).

Small, wrenlike, long-tailed Furnariidae (length about 130-150 

 mm.) with only 10 rectrices, and with tail not more than one and a 

 half times as long as wing. 



Bill much shorter than head, rather stout, moderately compressed,

 culmen gradually decurved from near base, the tip of maxilla not 

 uncinate; tomia slightly decurved terminally, without trace of sub- 

 terminal notch; gonys nearly straight, ascending terminally, at base 

 forming a slight angle with lower edge of mandibular rami. Nostril 

 exposed, posteriorly in contact with loral feathering, narrow (a longi- 

 tudinal slit) , overhung by a broad operculum. Rictal bristles want- 

 ing, and feathers of ehin, etc., without terminal setae. Wing rather 

 short, very concave beneath, much rounded, the longer primaries 

 exceeding secondaries by less (usually very much less) than length 

 of exposed culmen; sixth and seventh, fifth, sixth, and seventh, or 

 sixth, seventh, and eighth, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) 

 about two-thirds as long as the longest, the ninth shorter than sec- 

 ondaries (S. pudica, S. erythroihorax) or very much longer (S. rujica- 

 piUa, S. albescens). Tail decidedly longer than wing to nearly one 

 and a half times as long, graduated for more than half its length, the 

 rectrices (10) usually acuminate, sometimes with webs thin or semi- 

 decomposed. Tarsus nearly to much more than twice as long as bill 

 from nostril, nearly to quite three-fifths as long as wing, stout, dis- 

 tinctly scutellate; middle toe, with claw, very slightly to decidedly 

 shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to slightly 

 beyond subterminal articulation of middle toe, the inner toe very 

 slightly shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe, but much stouter; 

 basal phalanx of middle toe united for a little more than basal half 

 to outer toe, for slightly less to inner toe; claws moderate in size and 

 curvature, acute, that of the hallux much shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Color partly cinnamon-rufous, this either on pileum, 

 wings, or tail, sometimes on all three, occasionally on chest; other- 

 wise plain olive, brown, gray, or sooty, usually paler (sometimes 

 partly whitish) on under parts; no streaks, spots, nor bars. Sexes 

 alike. 



Nidification. — Nest an extremely bulky retort-shaped structure 

 composed outwardly of coarse sticks, built in bushes or low trees; 

 eggs white, bluish-white, or pale bluish green.

a In Sharpe's Hand-List of the Genera and Species of Birds, Vol. Ill, pp. 53-58 

 (1901), forty-nine species are referred to this genus. Of these I have examined about 

 one-half, but the above generic diagnosis and description are based on the three Central 

 American species and S. ruficapilla (type of the genus) alone. I am nearly convinced 

 that the group requires subdivision, but it should not be attempted with so poor a 

 representation of the species, and I therefore leave the problem for others to work out.

I am not able to examine a specimen of S. albescens albescens during preparation of 

 this key; indeed, the material available is, for all the forms, exceedingly scanty 

 and unsatisfactory. The synonymy of <S. a. albescens is as follows: Synallaxis albes-

Large scansorial Furnariidse (length about 200 mm.) with narrow 

 (slit-like), broadly operculate nostrils, wedge-shaped compressed bill, 

 acuminate, rigid-shafted rectrices, and with a tuft of elongated soft 

 (white or buff) feathers on each side of neck. 



Bill decidedly shorter to longer than head, nearly elongate-cuneate 

 in lateral profile, much compressed, its width at loral antise decidedly 

 less than its depth at same point and equal to less than one-third 

 the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla, the latter scarcely if at all 

 decurved; culmen rather indistinctly ridged anteriorly, the meso- 

 rhinium distinctly flattened, sometimess lightly arched above nostrils,

 wanting, and feathers of chin, etc., without terminal setse. Wing 

 large and pointed, with the longest primaries exceeding secondaries 

 by more than length of bill from nostril; sixth, seventh, and eighth 

 primaries longest and nearly equal, the tenth (outermost) more than 

 two-thirds as long as the longest, the ninth intermediate between 

 fourth and fifth. Tail about six-sevenths as long as wing, graduated

Medium sized Furnariidse (length about 145-190 mm.) with small, 

 roundish, non-operculate nostrils, culmen (from base) shorter than 

 tarsus, and basal phalanx of middle toe not wholly united to lateral 

 toes. 



Bill much shorter than head, relatively rather deep and compressed, 

 its width at loral antise much less than its depth at same point and 

 equal to one-third to much more than one-third the distance from 

 nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen (from base) shorter (usually much 

 shorter) than tarsus, broadly and rather indistinctly ridged, nearly 

 straight for basal half (more or less), more or less strongly decurved 

 terminally, the tip of maxilla slightly uncinate or sub-uncinate;

mandible then recurved or subfalcate), the extreme tip sometimes 

 slightly decurved; gonys gently convex, strongly ascending terminally, 

 more strongly convex and sometimes rather prominent basally. 

 Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with loral feathering, very 

 small, broadly oval or roundish, non-operculate, but margined above 

 by a very narrow concave membrane. Rictal bristles wanting, and 

 feathers of chin, etc., without terminal setae. Wing moderate, rather 

 pointed, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by less than 

 length of bill from nostril to more than length of exposed culmen; 

 sixth and seventh, sixth, seventh, and eighth, or fifth, sixth, seventh, 

 and eighth, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) between two- 

 thirds and three-fourths as long as the longest, the ninth much 

 longer than secondaries. Tail four-fifths as long as wing to very 

 slightly longer than wing, rounded or graduated (graduation equal 

 to from about one-ninth to more than one-third its total length), 

 the rectrices (12) subacuminate. Tarsus longer than culmen, less 

 than one-fourth to nearly one-third as long as wing, distinctly scutel- 

 late; middle toe, with claw, slightly shorter to slightly longer than 

 tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to about middle of sub- 

 terminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe slightly shorter; hallux 

 about as long as outer toe but decidedly stouter; basal phalanx of 

 middle toe united for much the greater part to outer toe, for at least 

 half to inner toe; claws rather large, strongly curved, and acute, that 

 of the hallux decidedly shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above brown or olive, the pileum and back sometimes 

 narrowly streaked with buffy or whitish, the former usually much 

 duller (grayer) or more dusky; upper tail-coverts and tail cinnamon- 

 rufous or chestnut; a more or less distinct (usually conspicuous) super- 

 ciliary stripe (often an orbital ring also) of buff or ochraceous; under 

 parts plain light buffy brown or yellowish brown, paler (yellowish 

 or buffy) on throat, or conspicuously streaked or flammulated. 

 Sexes alike. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Peru, Bolivia, southeastern Brazil, 

 and Venezuela. (About thirteen species.) a 



KEY TO THE SPECIES OF XENICOPSI8. 



a. Throat buffy or yellowish, chest light buffy brownish. 

 6. Hindneck, upper back, and chest not streaked; upper tail-coverts brown, con- 

 color with back; smaller (wing less than 90). 



<* Of these the following have been examined in this connection: X. rufosuper- 

 ciliatus (Lafresnaye), X. oleagineus Sclater, X. subalaris (Sclater), X. percnopterus 

 Oberholser, X. variegaticeps Sclater, X. striaticollis (Sclater), X. temporalis (Sclater), 

 and X. anxius (Bangs). The last four of these differ from typical Xenicopsis in 

 much less graduated tail, relatively much longer wing and shorter tarsus, and 

 unstreaked lower parts, and constitute a very well defined group, possibly a distinct 

 genus.

gonys faintly convex basally, straight or faintly concave terminally, 

 the tip of maxilla sometimes slightly decurved. Nostril exposed, 

 posteriorly in contact with loral feathering, rather small, roundish 

 or broadly oval, non-operculate, but margined above by very narrow 

 membranous rim. Rictal bristles wanting, and feathers of chin, 

 etc., without terminal setae. Wing moderate, much rounded, the 

 longest primaries exceeding secondaries by much less than length of 

 bill from nostril (except in A. leucophthalmus, in which the difference 

 between tip of secondaries and longest primaries nearly equals length 

 of exposed culmen); sixth, seventh, and eighth, sixth and seventh, 

 fifth, sixth, and seventh, or fifth and sixth primaries longest, the 

 tenth (outermost) less than two-thirds to three-fourths (A. leucoph- 

 thalmus) as long as the longest, the ninth longer than fourth (A. 

 leucopTithalmus) to shorter than second (A. rubiginosus). Tail six- 

 sevenths as long as wing (A. leucophthalmus) to as long as wing, 

 graduated (graduation equal to from less than one-fourth, in A. 

 leucophthalmus to more than one-third, in A. verse-pacis, its total 

 length), the rectrices (12) rather broad, with tip rounded or slightly 

 subacuminate. Tarsus shorter than culmen (from base), a little 

 more than one -fourth (in A. leucopTithalmus) to nearly one third (in 

 A. verse pads) as long as wing, distinctly scutellate; middle toe, with 

 claw, shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to or 

 slightly beyond middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the 

 inner toe slightly shorter; hallux nearly as long as outer toe, but 

 much stouter; basal phalanx of middle toe united for about half its 

 length to outer toe, for less than half to inner toe; claws moderate to 

 rather large, strongly curved, that of the hallux decidedly shorter 

 than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above plain brown (sometimes darker on pileum and 

 hindneck), the upper tail-coverts and tail (sometimes rump also) 

 cinnamon-rufous or chestnut; beneath plain tawny, cinnamon-brown, 

 or pale buffy (more brownish laterally) , the throat light russet, tawny, 

 ochraceous, buff, or whitish; foreneck sometimes faintly squamated 

 with brown or dusky; sometimes a tawny or ochraceous supra- 

 auricular stripe. Sexes alike. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to British Guiana, Peru, and south- 

 eastern Brazil. (About eighteen species.) a 



a Oi these I have examined, in this connection, only the following: A. rubiginosus 

 (Sclater), A. verxpacis Salvin and Godman, A. guerrerensis Salvin and Godman, A. 

 umbrinus Salvin and Godman, A. cervinigularis (Sclater), A. ochrolxmus (Tschudi), 

 A. pallidigularis Lawrence, A. leucophthalmus (Myiarchusximilian), and A. rufipectus Bangs. 

 All these agree very well in structural characters except A. leucophthalmus, which is 

 conspicuously different in its relatively longer and much more pointed wing, much 

 less graduated tail, and much shorter gonys.

AUTOMOLUS PALL1DIGDLAR1S PALLIDIGULARIS Lawrence. 



PALE-THROATED AUTOMOLUS. 



Somewhat like A. cervinigularis but superciliary stripe much less 

 distinct (the supra-auricular portion more or less obsolete), general 

 coloration paler, feathers of chest without darker margins, and size 

 smaUer. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum and hindneck sepia brown, paler on 

 forehead, where the feathers have indistinct narrow mesial streaks or 

 shaft-streaks of brownish buffy; back and scapulars plain deep olive- 

 brown, passing into chestnut on lower rump, tail-coverts, and tail and 

 into deep russet-brown or prouts brown on wings, this passing into 

 dusky on tips of remiges and primary coverts; an indistinct narrow 

 superciliary stripe of brownish buff, becoming obsolete above poste- 

 rior portion of auricular region; auricular and suborbital regions 

 sepia brown, with indistinct shaft-streaks of dull buffy; malar region, 

 chin, and throat immaculate pale dull cream buff; rest of under 

 parts light wood brown medially, passing laterally into tawny-olive 

 or raw-umber on sides and flanks and into light chestnut or tawny on 

 under tail-coverts, the chest with median portion of feathers pale 

 cream buffy, producing an indistinctly flammulated effect; under 

 wing-coverts and broad edgings to inner webs of remiges ochraceous- 

 buff ; maxilla horn color, the upper-basal portion dusky or blackish; 

 mandible horn color with lower-basal portion dull whitish (in dried 

 skins); legs and feet horn color (in dried skins).

Genus RHOPOCTITES Ridgway. 



Rhopoctite$a Ridgway, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xxii, April 17, 1909, 72. (Type, 

 Philydor rufo-brunneus Lawrence.) 



Medium sized to large Furnariidse (length about 165-210 nun.) 

 somewhat resembling the genus Automolus but with much stouter, 

 less compressed, and distinctly uncinate bill, culmen decidedly shorter 

 than tarsus, rigid and protruding shafts to rectrices, and streaked 

 coloration. 



Bill nearly as long as head, stout, moderately compressed, its 

 width at loral antiae decidedly less than its depth at same point and 

 contained slightly more than twice to about two and a hah times 

 in distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen decidedly shorter 

 than tarsus, distinctly ridged, nearly straight for basal half (more or 

 less) strongly decurved terminally, the tip of maxilla distinctly 

 uncinate; tomia nearly straight but slightly though distinctly 

 decurved terminally, without trace of notch; gonys convex and 

 rather prominent basally, ascending terminally, the tip sometimes 

 faintly decurved. Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with loral 

 feathering, roundish or broadly oval, nonoperculate but margined 

 above by a very narrow membraneous rim. Rictal bristles absent, 

 and feathers of chin, etc., without terminal setse. Wing moderate, 

 much rounded, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by less 

 than distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; sixth and seventh, or 

 fifth, sixth, and seventh, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) 

 about two-thirds as long as the longest, the ninth about as long as 

 secondaries. Tail about as long as wing (decidedly shorter in R. 

 ignoiilis1 b ), graduated for about one- third its length, the rectrices 

 (12) rather loosely webbed or semi-decomposed, with rigid and pro- 

 truded shafts. Tarsus longer than culmen, about one-third as long 

 as wing, rather stout, distinctly scutellate; middle toe, with claw, 

 slightly shorter than tarsus; outer toe, without claw, reaching to 

 about middle of subterminal phalanx of middle toe, the inner toe 

 slightly shorter; hallux about as long as inner toe but much stouter; 



a 'PAip (fxmtdc), bush, underwood, brushwood; ktIttjc, a colonist, inhabitant. 



b In the only specimen of Automolus ignobilis Sclater and Salvin available for 

 comparison, the tips of the rectrices are so much worn that the real length of the 

 tail can not be ascertained. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 223 



basal phalanx of middle toe united for more than half its length to 

 lateral toes; claws moderate to rather large, strongly curved, that of 

 hallux decidedly shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Above brown, usually darker and duller (sometimes 

 more grayish) on pileum and hindneck, the tail and upper tail-coverts 

 chestnut or chestnut-brown; under parts brown or olive, more or less 

 distinctly streaked with tawny, ochraceous, or buffy — -the pileum and 

 hindneck, or even the back, sometimes similarly streaked. Sexes 

 alike. 



Nidification. — Unknown? 



Range. — Costa Kica to Ecuad6r (to Peru, Bolivia, and southeastern 

 Brazil ? a ). (Several species. ) 



RHOPOCTITES RUFOBRUNNEUS (Lawrence). 



STREAKED AUTOMOLUS. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum and hindneck dark grayish brown or 

 brownish gray, the feathers margined with blackish; back, scapulars, 

 and wings deep warm-sepia or mummy brown, passing into chestnut 

 on lower rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail, the shafts of rectrices 

 much darker; lores mixed dusky and grayish; suborbital and auricular 

 regions streaked with dusky and dull ochraceous or light brownish; 

 malar region, sides of neck (anteriorly), chin, and throat OGhraceous 

 (more or less deep), the feathers more or less distinctly edged or 

 narrowly margined with dusky olive or blackish; rest of under parts 

 light tawny-olive, more olive on chest, where more or less broadly 

 streaked with ochraceous, usually more ochraceous on abdomen, the 

 under tail-coverts more rufescent; under wing-coverts tawny-ochra- 

 ceous, the inner webs of remiges broadly edged with pale ochraceous- 

 buff or deep pinkish buff; bill black, the mandible usually brownish 

 basally; legs and feet horn color (in dried skins). 



"The above diagnosis and description are based exclusively on Philydor rufo- 

 brunneus Lawrence and Automolus ignobilis Sclater and Salvin, but several other 

 species referred to Automolus by Sclater and others seem to be nearly related and 

 perhaps are — some of them at least — congeneric. These are: Automolus ferrugino- 

 lentus (Myiarchusximilian), A. holostictus Sclater and Salvin, A. striaticeps Taczanowski, A. 

 subulatus (Spix) and A. stietoptilus (Cabanis), none of which have been examined 

 by me. 



Rhopoctites ignobilis differs considerably from R. rufo-brunneus (type of the genus) 

 in shorter, deeper, and relatively more compressed bill, and, apparently, in relatively 

 shorter tail; but the differences are within the usual normal limits of variation.

Tracheophone Mesomyodian Passeres with the metasternum 2- 

 notched, interorbital septum imperforate, postorbital process small, 

 maxillo-palatines short and broad (crossing posterior end of the 

 olfactory fossa and terminating immediately in front of the descend- 

 ing plate of the palatine), vomer short, tensor patagii brevis tendon 

 typically passerine, nares usually holorhinal (but occasionally schizo- 

 rhinal); syrinx tracheal, with two pairs of short tracheo-bronchal 

 muscles, palate compound segithognathous or semi-desmognathous 

 (the palatines fused at anterior end and with the internasal septum) ; 

 mesorhinium normal; tarsal envelope endaspidean; outer toe about 

 as long as middle toe (much longer than inner toe), the three anterior 

 toes united for full length of the basal phalanx; the middle adherent 

 to the outer by nearly, if not quite, the full length of the second 

 phalanx also; hallux (without claw) shorter than inner toe (without 

 claw). 



Like the allied Furnariidse the Dendrocolaptidae are peculiar to 

 the continental portions of the Neotropical Kegion, but unlike the 

 latter they belong almost exclusively to the intertropical portions, 

 and are, proportionally, better developed in the Central American 

 district. The family is far less numerous and varied, however, than 

 the Furnariidse, consisting of only about 14 genera and 127 species, 

 or considerably less than half as many as are contained in the allied 

 family. 



The Dendrocolaptidae are more arboreal than the Furnariidse, all 

 being distinctly "scansorial," while comparatively few of the Fur- 

 nariidse are thus adapted. They represent and more or less resem- 

 ble, superficially, the Woodpeckers (Picidse) and Tree-Creepers 

 (Certhiidse), more especially the latter, most of the species having 

 similarly curved and compressed bills, a more or less varied brownish 

 coloration, and lengthened, graduated, and stiff-pointed tails. Like 

 the Certhiidse and unlike the Picidse they have three toes in front 

 and one behind, but the former, instead of being cleft to the base 

 are united for the length of their first and second phalanges; and 

 the middle toe, instead of being much longer than the outer one, 

 barely, or not at all exceeds the latter in length. Like the Wood- 

 peckers, however, and unlike the Creepers, the Woodhewers have the 

 habit of loudly tapping or hammering on the trunks and branches of 

 trees. Some genera have the bill enormously developed as to length 

 and greatly curved, sometimes in the shape of a bow — a modification 

 evidently adapted to the purpose of probing the burrows of wood- 

 boring insects. In others the bill is straight and quite woodpecker- 

 81255°— Bull. 50—11 15 




226 BTJLMJTIN 50, UUflTED STATES NATIONAL, MUSEUM. 



like in form, though without a chisel-shaped tip and well adapted to 

 hammering or chipping the decayed wood, as in the case of the 

 Woodpeckers. In size the Dendrocolaptidse vary from the dimensions 

 of a true Creeper (Oerihia) to those of a Flicker (Colaptes). There is 

 little range in the variety of their coloration, rufous or chestnut and 

 olivaceous hues prevailing throughout the group, often unvaried but 

 sometimes relieved by streaks or bars of darker and lighter hues. 



The family as properly restricted is equal to the "Subfamily 

 DendrocolaptiTise" of Dr. Sclater,° minus the genera Myiarchusrgarornis 

 and PygarrMyiarchusus, which belong to the Furnariidse, and plus the 

 genera Glyphorhynchus and Dendrornis, which constitute Dr. Sclater's 

 "Subfamily Glyphorhynchinse."

 subterminally; mandibular tomium very faintly to rather distinctly 

 convex, with faint trace of subterminal notch; gonys practically 

 straight for most of its length but convex and slightly prominent 

 basally, sometimes slightly decurved terminally. Nostril exposed, 

 posteriorly in contact with latero-frontal feathering, roundish or 

 broadly oval, nonoperculate. Bictal bristles absent, but feathers of 

 chin and lores with loose, semidecomposed, setaceous webs. Wing 

 large, pointed, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by nearly 

 to quite the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; seventh, seventh 

 and eighth, or sixth, seventh, and eighth primaries longest, the 

 tenth (outermost) two-thirds or more as long as the longest, the 

 ninth longer than fourth, sometimes longer than fifth. Tail nearly 

 as long as wing, graduated for about the length of culmen, the rec- 

 trices (12) conspicuously acuminate, with very strong and extremely 

 rigid shafts, which are more or less strongly decurved terminally. 

 Tarsus shorter than exposed culmen, a little more than one-fifth 

 as long as wing, rather slender, distinctly scutellate (endaspidean) ; 

 middle toe, with claw, slightly shorter than tarsus; outer toe (with 

 or without claw) as long as middle toe or very slightly longer; inner 

 toe (without claw) reaching to a little beyond subterminal articula- 

 tion of middle toe, its claw reaching to base of middle claw (D. certhia) 

 or f ailing far short (D. validus) ; hallux decidedly shorter than inner 

 toe, little if any stouter; middle toe united to outer toe by whole of 

 basal and part of second phalanx, to inner toe by at least half the 

 basal phalanx; claws large, very strongly curved, very acute, that of 

 the hallux less strongly curved, longer than the digit. 



Coloration. — Brown or olive, the tail, upper tail-coverts and 

 remiges deep cinnamon-rufous or chestnut; pileum streaked, or 

 spotted with paler brown or bufTy or barred with black; under parts 

 paler brown, olive, or brownish buffy more or less distinctly barred 

 with darker or blackish, the chest sometimes streaked, the throat 

 usually mostly dull whitish or pale brownish buffy. Sexes alike. 



Nidification. — Nesting in holes of trees; eggs white.

o Among specimens from Boruca are some that I can not distinguish from typical 

 D. sanctirthomie; in fact, while the difference of coloration in the two forms is quite 

 obvious when extreme examples are compared, the absence of strict corellation 

 between the color-differences and geographic distribution is difficult to understand.

Both Sclater and Salvin and Godman compare this form with the 

 South American D. plcumnus, but the characters wherein it differs 

 from the Costa Rican form of D. validus are not clear from either of 

 the descriptions quoted or the context thereof. The form is probably 

 a subspecies of D. validus.

«■ The following have been examined in the preparation of this work: X. albicollis 

 (Vieillot), X. argentinus Ridgway, X. emigrans Sclater (and its several subspecies), 

 X. promeropirhynchus (Lesson), X. crassirostris Taczanowski and Berlepsch, X. 

 fortis Heine, X. virgatus Ridgway, X. ignotus Bidgway, X. compressirostris Tac- 

 zanowski, X. saturatus Ridgway, X. major Vieillot, X. castaneus Ridgway, and 

 X. cinnamomeus Ridgway. 



b All the Mexican and Central American forms of this genus are evidently very 

 closely related to X. promeropirhynchus (Lesson) and other forms of northern South 

 America; but material available for study is so scant that their exact statue can not 

 be worked out at the present time.

 paler, sometimes margined with blackish; tail uniform deep cinna- 

 mon-rufous or rufous-chestnut; lesser wing-coverts rufous-brown, 

 with very indistinct mesial streaks of paler; middle coverts raw-

XIPHORHYNCHUS STRIATIGULARIS (Richmond). 



STRIPED-THROATED WOODHEWER. 



Slightly resembling X. flavigaster but differing greatly in having 

 the whole throat conspicuously streaked; buff streaks of chest, etc., 

 margined laterally with a chain-like streak of blackish; wing-coverts 

 conspicuously streaked with black and buff, and buff streaks of back 

 much broader. 



Adult female." — Pileum and hindneck sooty black, each feather 

 with a broad mesial guttate streak of buff or clay color; back and 

 scapulars brown (between light olive and raw-umber) each feather 

 with a broad mesial streak of brownish buff or clay color, broadly 

 margined with black; lesser and middle wing-coverts similar, but 

 buffy mesial streaks much narrower; greater coverts similar but 

 with still narrower streaks; remiges plain deep cinnamon-rufous or 

 rufous-chestnut, the terminal portion of inner webs of primaries 

 (except the innermost) grayish brown; rump plain light cinnamon- 

 rufous or rufous tawny, the upper tail-coverts deeper cinnamon- 

 rufous, with indistinct shaft-streaks of paler; tail (including shafts 

 of rectrices) plain deep cinnamon-rufous or rufous-chestnut; sides of 

 head and neck broadly streaked with buff and sooty blackish; chin, 

 throat, and foreneck similarly streaked, the streaks becoming gradu- 

 ally broader and more sharply defined, and the feathers edged with 

 light buffy grayish brown, on lower foreneck; chest, breast, etc., 

 similarly streaked, but the blackish streaks narrower and more 

 irregular and grayish brown edgings to the feathers broader, the 

 streaks becoming gradually narrower and less distinct posteriorly; 

 under wing-coverts mixed pale cinnamon-rufous and light buffy 

 brownish (the latter prevailing along edge of wing, where streaked 

 with buffy and blackish) ; inner webs of remiges pale cinnamon-rufous 

 or vinaceous-cinnamon, the terminal portion (extensively) of outer 

 primaries grayish brown; bill pale yellowish horn color, the maxilla 

 more brownish basally; feet light horn brownish (in dried skins); 



o The adult male is unknown, but judging from the general rule in this group the 

 sexes are probably alike in color.

XIPHORHYNCHUS NANUS NANUS (Lawrence). 



LAWRENCE'S WOODHEWEE. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum and hindneck dark sooty brown or 

 sooty blackish, each feather with a broad mesial guttate streak or 

 mark of brownish buff; back and scapulars olive-brown (between 

 raw-umber and mummy), the feathers of upper back with a broad 

 mesial streak of brownish buff or pale tawny, margined with blackish; 

 rump and upper tail-coverts plain cinnamon-rufous; tail, including 

 shafts of rectrices, chestnut; remiges deep cinnamon-rufous, the 

 primaries and distal secondaries edged (more or less distinctly) with 

 grayish brown or olive; wing-coverts plain brown, nearly if not 

 quite concolor with back; supra-auricular region pale brownish 

 buff or dull buffy whitish, the feathers narrowly margined with dusky; 

 auricular region streaked with light brown and dusky; suborbital 

 region with feathers light buff margined with dusky, the malar region 

 similar but with dusky margins to feathers much less distinct (partly 

 obsolete); chin and throat plain light brownish buff or dull pinkish 

 buff, the feathers of extreme lower throat narrowly margined with 

 dusky; feathers of chest light brownish buff or dull pinkish buff 

 centrally, those of upper chest wholly of this color except for a narrow 

 but distinct margin of dusky, those of lower chest with a broad 

 median ovate or elliptical stripe of buff margined laterally by a 

 blackish line, the edges (more or less broadly) light buffy brown; 

 rest of under parts light buffy brown (nearly wood brown or isabella 

 color), the median portion of breast and abdomen usually with nar- 

 row and indistinct streaks of paler; under wing-coverts ochraceous- 

 buff, the inner webs of remiges deeper, inclining to cinnamon-rufous, 

 the longer primaries with terminal portion dusky; maxilla blackish 

 brown, mandible pale horn color or dull yellowish (in dried skins); 

 feet horn color or dusky (in dried skins) . 



Young. — Similar to adults but markings of under parts rather 

 more strongly contrasted; only to be distinguished with certainty, 

 however, by the softer and more lax texture of the plumage.

Bill as long as or longer than head (but much less than twice as 

 long as tarsus), decidedly though not conspicuously decurved through- 

 out, rather slender, much compressed, its width at latero-frontal 

 antise slightly to decidedly less than depth at same point and con- 

 tained from four and a half to seven times in distance from nostril to 

 tip of maxilla; culmen and tomia gradually decurved from base, the 

 latter without trace of subterminal notch; gonys very faintly to rather 

 strongly concave, sometimes slightly prominent basally. Nostril 

 exposed, posteriorly in contact with latero-frontal feathering, longi- 

 tudinally oval, nonoperculate, but margined above by a narrow mem- 

 brane. Rictal bristles absent, and feathers of chin, etc., without 

 terminal setse. Wing moderate or rather large, rather pointed, the 

 longest primaries exceeding secondaries by nearly to much more than 

 length of tarsus; eighth, seventh and eighth, sixth, seventh, and 

 eighth, or seventh, eighth, and ninth primaries longest, the tenth 

 (outermost) nearly to a little more than three-fourths as long as the 

 longest, the ninth longer than fifth, sometimes equal to the longest. 

 Tail, three-fourths to (usually) decidedly more than three-fourths as 

 long as wing, graduated for about one-fourth its length, the rectrices 

 (12) acuminate, their strong and very rigid shafts decurved, some- 

 times twisted, terminally: Tarsus much shorter to slightly longer 

 (P. tenuirostris) than length of bill from nostril, one-fourth (P. 

 tenuirostris) to much less than one-fourth as long as wing, distinctly 

 scutellate (endaspidean) ; middle toe, with claw, equal to tarsus or 

 decidedly longer; outer toe, without claw, equal to or slightly longer 

 than middle toe; inner toe, without claw, reaching to subterminal 

 articulation of middle toe; hallux decidedly shorter than inner toe, 

 scarcely if at all stouter; middle toe united to outer toe for whole of 

 first and part of second phalanx, to inner toe by greater part of first 

 phalanx; anterior claws large, very strongly curved, acute, that of the 

 hallux much less curved, equal to or shorter than the digit. 



Coloration. — Rump, upper tail-coverts, tail, and at least part of 

 remiges cinnamon-rufous or rufous-chestnut; back, scapulars, and 

 wing-coverts olive-brown, russet, or cinnamon-rufous; pileum and 

 hindneck brown or dusky, streaked or spotted with paler (sometimes 

 the back also streaked), or feathers margined with dusky; chin and 

 throat white or buffy (feathers of throat sometimes narrowly mar-

KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF PICOLAPTES. 



a. Breast essentially bicolored, the very pale buff or buffy white median area on 

 each feather very broad, the edges of the feathers mostly or wholly black; buffy 

 or whitish streaks on pileum and hindneck broader; back more grayish brown. 



(Western and central Mexico.) Picolaptes leucogaster (p. 259). 



aa. Breast distinctly tricolored, the feathers broadly edged with brown, this much 



broader than the black line edging the narrower buffy mesial area; buffy streaks 



on pileum narrower; back more cinnamomeous brown. 



6. Myiarchusrkings on pileum guttate or rhomboid (spot-like). (Picolaptes affinis.) 



c. Under parts with stripes narrower, less distinct posteriorly; throat paler buff 



(not deeper than color of stripes on breast, etc.). (Southern Mexico to 



Guatemala.) Picolaptes afflnis affinis (p. 261). 



cc. Under parts with stripes broader, more distinct posteriorly; throat deeper 

 buff than color of stripes on breast, etc. (Costa Rica and western PanamA.) 



Picolaptes affinis neglectus (p. 263). 

 56. Myiarchusrkings on pileum linear (streak-like). (Picolaptes lineaticeps.) 

 c. Pale buffy streaks on back and under parts narrower, the former more acicular; 

 throat paler and less extensively buffy. 

 d. Coloration paler, the ground color of pileum lighter sepia brown, back, 

 etc., light cinnamon-brown; streaks on upper back smaller, without 

 distinct blackish edges. (Eastern Panama^)

PICOLAPTES LEUCOGASTER (Swainson). 



WHITE-STHIPED WOODHEWEB.. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Pileum and hindneck deep olive-brown or 

 sepia, each feather with a broad guttate or elliptical streak of buff 

 or buffy white, margined with blackish; back, scapulars, and wing- 

 coverts buffy olive-brown (nearly broccoli brown), the upper back 

 usually with a few streaks of buff (with or without blackish margins) ; 

 rump, upper tail-coverts, tail, and remiges deep cinnamon-rufous or 

 rufous-chestnut, the remiges, however, passing basally into brownish 

 (like color of wing-coverts, etc.), and terminal portion of inner 

 webs of primaries dusky; orbital ring and supra-auricular stripe 

 white or buffy white, the feathers of the latter narrowly margined 

 with black; a narrow postocular stripe of blackish or dusky, nar- 

 rowly streaked with white or pale buff; the greater portion of 

 auricular region buffy white or very pale buff, narrowly streaked 

 with dusky; suborbital and malar regions, chin, and throat buffy 

 white, the. lower throat margined on each side by one or more 

 streaks of black or dusky; the feathers of extreme lower throat 

 (sometimes those of suborbital region and posterior portion of 




260 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



malar region also), narrowly margined with the same; foreneck and 

 chest buffy white or very pale buff, the feathers broadly margined 

 with black or dusky, producing a squamate effect; rest of under 

 parts similar but with mesial buffy or whitish area on each feather 

 narrower, the blackish lines submarginal instead of marginal, the 

 feathers broadly edged with light grayish olive or grayish brown, 

 this gradually increasing (at expense of the whitish or buffy mesial 

 stripes and blackish lines) posteriorly, where, on flanks, lower abdo- 

 men, and under tail-coverts the light grayish brown predominates; 

 under wing-coverts ochraceous-buff, paler on margin of wing; inner 

 webs of remiges light cinnamon-rufous, the longer primaries grayish 

 brown terminally; maxilla deep horn brown, darker basally; mandi- 

 ble paler, especially toward base; legs and feet horn color or dusky 

 (in dried skins). 



Young. — Similar to adults but blackish margins and edgings to 

 feathers of lower parts more irregular or broken, and color of back 

 more olivaceous (less tawny) brown.

Medium sized Dendrocolaptidae (length about 200-250 mm.) 

 with excessively elongated, slender, compressed, and strongly arched 

 bill and broadly oval nonoperculate nostrils. 



Bill very much longer than head, more than twice as long as tarsus, 

 slender, compressed, conspicuously decurved or arched, its width 

 at latero-frontal antise much less than its depth at same point and 

 equal to less than one-twelfth the distance from nostril to tip of 

 maxilla; culmen rounded (not ridged), very strongly decurved from 

 base; tomia strongly decurved, without trace of subterminal notch; 

 gonys deeply concave and decurved, though nearly straight terminally. 

 Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with latero-frontal feather- 

 ing, more or less broadly oval, nonoperculate. Eictal bristles absent, 

 and feathers of chin, etc., without terminal setse. Wing moderate, 

 rather rounded, the longest primaries exceeding secondaries by much 

 less than length of tarsus; seventh and eighth, or sixth, seventh, 

 and eighth, primaries longest, the tenth (outermost) two-thirds to 

 nearly three-fourths as long as the longest, the ninth intermediate 

 between third and fourth (ft venezuelensis) or between fifth and 

 sixth (ft pusiUus). Tail nearly as long as wing, graduated one- 

 fourth to more than one-third its length, the rectrices (12) acumi- 

 nate, with their very strong and rigid shafts decurved terminally. 

 Tarsus about one-fourth as long as wing, distinctly scutellate (en- 

 daspidean); middle toe, with claw, a little longer than tarsus; outer 

 toe (with or without claw) as long as middle toe; inner toe, without 

 claw, reaching to a little beyond subterminal articulation of middle 

 toe; hallux decidedly shorter than inner toe, decidedly (but not 

 conspicuously) stouter; middle toe united to outer toe for whole of 

 its first and about half of its second phalanx (for first and second 

 phalanges of outer toe), to inner toe for whole of its first phalanx; 



o As Myiarchus. Oberholser states (Smithsonian Myiarchussc. Coll., xlviii, 1905, 62) while "Swain- 

 son evidently intended to make Dendrocolaptes procurvus Temminck the type of 

 Xiphorhynchus, he defeated his purpose by allowing the previous publication of 

 Xiphorhynchus in combination with the name of a species of another group, such 

 publication being quite sufficient to fix the name of a genus."

CAMPYLORHAMPHUS VENEZUELENSIS (Chapman). 



VENEZUELAN SICKLE BILL. 



Adults {sexes alike).. — Pileum deep sepia or bister brown, each 

 feather with a mesial guttate streak of dull buff or clay color, the 

 hindneck similar but the ground color slightly lighter brown; back 

 and scapulars lighter, more fulvous or russet, brown (between raw- 

 umber and russet or mars brown), the upper back usually with more 

 or less distinct narrow mesial streaks of pale dull buffy; rump more 

 rufescent brown than back, the upper tail-coverts still more strongly 

 rufescent (nearly cinnamon-rufous); tail and remiges, including 

 shafts, plain chestnut, the wing-coverts similar but duller (intermedi- 

 ate between color of remiges and that of back) ; sides of head and neck 

 rather broadly streaked with deep sepia brown and pale dull buffy; 

 chin and throat pale dull buffy or dull buffy whitish, the feathers of 

 throat rather broadly edged with sepia brown, producing distinct 

 streaks; foreneck and chest light brown (between raw-umber and 

 isabella color), with rather broad mesial linear streaks of pale buffy 

 or dull buffy whitish, the breast similar but with the streaks narrower 

 and less distinct; rest of under parts similar but slightly paler and 

 with streaks obsolete (absent on flanks and thighs); under wing- 

 coverts deep ochraceous-buff, paler and usually indistinctly necked 

 with pale brownish along edge of wing; inner webs of remiges vina- 

 ceous-cinnamon, the outer primaries passing into grayish brown ter- 

 minally; bill light reddish brown (nearly cinnamon-rufous); iris 

 brown; legs and feet dusky horn color or olive (in dried skins). 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 226-252 (239); wing, 92-96.5 (94); 

 tail, 72-81 (78); culmen (chord), 60-66 (62); tarsus, 21.5-22 (21.8);

 (21.5); middle toe, 17-18 (17.5). 6 



In all probability, comparison of good series of specimens will show that the Panama 

 bird is separable from that of Venezuela.

Sittacilla Lesson, Compl. de Buffon, ix, 1837, 135. (Type, Dendrocolaptes cune- 

 atus Lichtenstein.) 



Small Dendrocolaptidse (length about 140 mm.) with bill much 

 shorter than head, stout, wedge-shaped, with maxilla broad and 

 flattened terminally; nostril narrow, broadly operculate, and tail 

 (nearly as long as wing) with the very rigid rectrices very strongly 

 decurved terminally. 



Bill much shorter than head, stout, wedge-shaped, its width at 

 latero-frontal antise decidedly greater than its depth at same point 

 and equal to about half the distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; 

 culmen broad and rounded (not ridged), straight basally, rather 

 suddenly depressed terminally, the tip of maxilla broad and rounded 

 in vertical profile but acute in lateral aspect; maxillary tomium nearly 

 straight, but slightly incised or faintly notched terminally; man- 

 dibular tomium straight or very faintly concave (the mandible very 

 slightly recurved terminally); gonys strongly convex and rather 

 prominent basally, nearly straight and strongly ascending terminally. 

 Nostril exposed, posteriorly in contact with latero-frontal feathering, 

 narrow (slit-like), longitudinal, overhung by a very broad and con- 

 spicuous operculum .and. also margined below by the integument of 

 the nasal fossa. Rictal bristles present but minute, and feathers of 

 chin and lores with minute terminal setse. Wing moderate, rather 

 pointed, the longer primaries exceeding secondaries by more than 

 length of exposed culmen; seventh and eighth primaries longest, 

 the tenth (outermost) about three-fourths as long as the longest, the 

 ninth about equal to sixth. Tail nearly as long as wing, graduated 

 for one-third, or more, of its length, the rectrices (12) acuminate, 

 with the very strong and excessively rigid shafts very strongly 

 decurved terminally. Tarsus much longer than culmen (from 

 base) ; about one-fourth as long as wing, distinctly scutellate (endas- 

 pidean) ; middle toe, with claw, decidedly shorter than tarsus ; outer 

 toe, with or without claw, as long as middle toe; inner toe, without 

 claw, reaching to middle of sub terminal phalanx of middle toe; 

 hallux conspicuously shorter than inner toe, not stouter; middle toe 

 united to outer toe for whole of first and part of second phalanx, 

 to inner toe for whole of its first phalanx; anterior claws large, very 

 strongly curved and acute, that of the hallux much less curved, 

 about as long as the digit.

MEXICAN SITTASOMUS. » 



Adults {sexes alike).' — Pileum and hindneck plain grayish olive, the 

 sides of head and under parts (except under tail-coverts) similar but 

 lighter; back and scapulars uniform russet, sometimes slightly tinged 

 with olive, passing on rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail into clear 

 deep cinnamon-rufous; wing-coverts similar in color to back and 

 scapulars, but with an indistinct central area of grayish olive; secon- 

 daries deep cinnamon-rufous, with a large subterminal area (not cross- 

 ing outer web) of dull black or dusky, this sharply denned anteriorly 

 against a basal area of clear buff or ochraceous-buff on inner web ; proxi- 

 mal (shorter) primaries similarly colored, but dusky subterminal area 

 not so dark (more sooty brownish), cinnamon-rufous tip narrower and 

 duller, and basal portion of outer web duller (dull ochraceous or cin- 

 namon); distal (longer) primaries with outer web cinnamon, the 

 three outermost with inner webs wholly dusky; alula and primary 

 coverts grayish brown; axillars buff; under wing-coverts and broad 

 oblique band across inner webs of remiges deep cream-buff or light 

 ochraceous-buff; under tail-coverts cinnamon-rufous, the flanks 

 sometimes tinged with the same; maxilla dusky horn color, paler 

 along tomium; mandible paler with terminal portion dusky; iris 

 brown; legs and feet horn color or dusky (in dried skins). 



a The utter impossibility of inventing English names for all of the thousands of 

 species and subspecies of birds found in Tropical America necessitates the occasional 

 UBe of the Greek or Latin generic name in cases where there is no native vernac- 

 ular name to take the place of an English one. Unfortunately the native language 

 is often very poor in bird-names, many diverse kinds being often grouped under one 

 term, as c&me-maiz (corn-eater) for sparrowB in general, or else the names in general 

 use are borrowed from extremely different European birds. In Costa Rica, for 

 example, the Spanish name gorrifrn (sparrow) is universally applied and practically 

 restricted to hummingbirds, that of caldndria (lark) to the three-caruncled bell-bird, 

 and that of jilguSro (linnet) to the Myadestes of that country. 



The author is well aware that there are persons who imagine that the English 

 language is equal to any emergency and resent the use of anything else; but the 

 views of Buch would surely change were they to attempt the task of naiSiing in Eng- 

 lish terms all of the American birds alone that are not already thus name\3-.

Genus DECONYCHURA Cherrie. 



Deconychura b Cherrie, Proc. U. S. Nat. Myiarchuss., xiv, no. 855, Sept. 4, 1891, 338. 

 (Type, D. typica Cherrie.) 



Medium sized or rather small Dendrocolaptidse (length about 170 

 mm.) with narrow operculate nostrils, tail equal to or longer than 

 wing, graduated for about half its length, with the very rigid shafts 

 of rectrices strongly decurved subterminally, and with culmen 

 (from base) longer than tarsus, and inner webs of remiges without 

 any buffy or ochraceous cross-band. 



Bill nearly as long as head, straight, rather stout, broad and 

 depressed basally, its width at latero-frontal antise much greater 

 than its depth at same point and equal to a little less than half the 

 distance from nostril to tip of maxilla; culmen distinctly ridged, 

 straight for basal half or more, gradually but decidedly decurved 

 terminally; tomia slightly but distinctly decurved terminally, with- 

 out trace of notch; gonys faintly convex basally, straight or even 

 very faintly concave distally. Nostril exposed, posteriorly in con- 

 tact with latero-frontal feathering, narrowly ovate or elliptical, 

 longitudinal, margined above by a rather narrow membraneous 

 operculum. Kictal bristles obvious but very small, and feathers of 

 chin and lores with minute terminal setae. Wing rather long and 

 pointed, with longest primaries exceeding secondaries by less than 

 length of exposed culmen; eighth primary longest, the seventh 

 and sixth, successively, but little shorter, the tenth (outermost) 

 nearly three-fourths as long as the longest, the ninth shorter than 

 sixth. Tail equal to or slightly longer than wing, graduated for 



° One specimen (the type). 



6 Derived from dim ten, 3vuf claw, and olipb. tail. 




284 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



about half its length, the rectrices (12°) abruptly and conspicuously 

 acuminate, with their very rigid shafts twisted and strongly decurved 

 subterminally. Tarsus about as long as exposed culmen, less than 

 one-fourth as long as wing, slender, distinctly scutellate (enda- 

 spidean); middle toe, with claw, shorter than tarsus; outer toe, with 

 or without claw, equal to or very slightly longer than middle toe; 

 inner toe, without claw, reaching to a little beyond subterminal 

 articulation of middle toe; hallux much shorter than inner toe, not 

 stouter; middle toe united to outer toe by whole of its first and about 

 half of its second phalanx, to inner toe by greater part of its first 

 phalanx; anterior claws rather large, very strongly curved and 

 acute, that of the hallux slightly curved, as long as or longer than 

 the digit. 



Coloration. — Tail-coverts, tail, and remiges chestnut or rufous- 

 chestnut; pileum and back olive-brown, the former with narrow 

 indistinct streaks of paler; beneath light olive-brown, throat brown- 

 ish buff or clay color, the chest sometimes spotted with the same. 



Nidijlcation. — Nests in holes; eggs glossy white. 



Range. — Costa Rica to British Guiana and upper Amazon Valley. 

 (Four species. b ) 



This genus is distinctly intermediate between Sittasomus and Dendrocincla, and 

 I quite agree with Hellmayr that it is more nearly related to the latter than to the 

 former; but I can not believe that it is "perhaps barely separable" from Dendrocincla 

 (see Hellmayr, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, xiv, 1904, 52), the difference in the character 

 of the tips of the rectrices (in which character Deconychura is precisely like Glypho- 

 rynchus and Sittasomus and very unlike Dendrocincla), even apart from the differ- 

 ence in the form of the bill, being, in my opinion, quite sufficient to justify generic 

 separation. I have not, however, seen Dendrocincla longicauda Pelzeln, which 

 Hellmayr refers to Deconychura, and which may possibly bridge the gap apparently 

 separating the two genera as understood by me. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES OF DECONYCHURA." 



a. Rump brown like back (only the upper tail-coverts chestnut-rufous); bend of 

 wing washed with cinnamon-rufous. 

 6. Smaller (wing 95-102 in male, 86-90 in female; bill, from rictus, 24-25.5); 

 breast spotted or streaked with buff. (Southwestern Costa Rica and Panamd,.)

bb. Larger (wing 107-111 in male, 102 in female; bill, from rictus, 27-29 in male, 



25 in female); breast plain, like abdomen. (British Guiana to Rio Negro

o Hellmayr was the first to call attention to the fact that this genus possesses twelve 

 rectrices, not ten, as stated by its describer. (See Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, xiv, 

 1904, 52.)

a Anomalogonatous birds are those which lack the ambiens muscle. Besides the 

 Coraciiformes, the Passeriformes also are anomalogonatous, all other birds, according 

 to Garrod (Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1874, 116-118), being homalogonatous. The mor- 

 phological value of this character was so greatly overestimated by Garrod that he 

 made it the basis of his primary division of the Class Aves into two "Subclasses," 

 Anomalogonatae and Homalogonatse.

 median lateral groove or sulcus; nostrils basal, lateral, broadly 

 operculate, but often completely hidden by dense frontal feather- 

 ing; tongue extremely long, slender, extensile, split terminally, each

 maries excessively developed and the secondaries correspondingly 

 reduced, the latter not longer than the first (innermost) primary and

 outermost (tenth) longest or (rarely) equal to the ninth (in genra 

 Aiihurus and Goldmania) distinctly shorter than ninth; rec trices ten, 

 the tail excessively variable in relative length, form, etc. ; c young 

 nidicolous and gymnopsedic; nest open above, variable as to form and 

 position but usually cup-shaped and attached to a twig, composed of 

 plant-downs or other soft materials, usually stuccoed exteriorly with 

 bits of moss, lichen, or fragments of bark and spiders' webs; eggs one 

 or (usually) two, broadly elliptical, immaculate white. 



Inhabitants exclusively of America, the Humming Birds constitute 

 not only the most charming element in the wonderfully varied bird- 

 life of the Western Hemisphere, but, also, without doubt, the most 

 remarkable group of birds in the entire world. No other group of 

 birds is so brilliant in plumage or so different from all others in their 

 mode of flight and manner of feeding. The general habits of Hum- 

 ming Birds are not dissimilar to those of birds in general. They 

 are both aerial and arboreal, but are unable to progress upon the 

 ground or any flat surface by means of their legs and feet alone. 

 They perch readily and frequently upon trees or bushes, or may

even cling to rocks or other vertical surfaces; and their nidification 

 presents nothing that may be deemed peculiar or even specially 

 characteristic. In their flight and manner of procuring their food, 

 however, they differ strikingly from all other birds, in these, respects 

 closely resembling certain insects, especially the crepuscular hawk- 

 moths (Sphingidse). Their food, consisting mainly of small insects 

 but in part also of the nectar of flowers, is mostly gleaned from 

 blossoms, before which they poise, with wings so rapidly vibrating 

 as to be invisible except as a dim haze or halo partly surrounding 

 the body and producing the humming sound from which these birds 

 derive their vernacular name, the bill thrust inside the flower and 

 the slender, semitubular tongue extended into the depths of the 

 blossom. Some species, instead of feeding from flowers, glean their 

 insect food from the bark of forest trees, following along the branches 

 in suspended flight in the same manner that the others pass from 

 flower to flower. In their feeding from flower to flower, Humming 

 Birds, like bees, butterflies, and moths, perform the same office in 

 the economy of nature as insects by transferring pollen from one 

 bloom to another, and thus assisting in the fertilization of plants. 

 In flying from one point to another, the flight of Humming Birds, 

 while essentially direct, is usually more or less undulating, and so 

 extremely rapid that the eye can scarcely follow. Often this flight 

 is accompanied (at least in the case of males of some species) by a 

 more or less remarkable screeching or grating sound, produced 

 mechanically by some peculiarity of wing-structure. 



Diminutiveness of size and metallic brilliancy of coloring are the 

 chief external characteristics of Humming Birds, though exceptions 

 to both occur; and in these respects they, as a group, have no 

 rivals. Unfortunately stuffed specimens convey but a faint idea of 

 their splendid coloring, for the perfection of their changeable reful- 

 gence can be fully realized only in the living bird, whose every 

 change of position flashes to view a different hue — emerald green 

 replacing ruby red, sapphire blue succeeding fiery orange, or either 

 becoming opaque velvety black — according to the angle at which 

 the sun's rays touch the feathers, an effect which can only partially 

 be imitated with the stuffed specimen by artificially changing its 

 position with reference to the light. Myiarchusny species have a spot of 

 the most luminous or brilliantly metallic color (usually green) that 

 it is possible to imagine on the forehead at the base of the bill, this 

 spot being surrounded by the most intense velvety black — evidently 

 to enhance the brilliancy of the ornament by contrast, just as a 

 jeweler would, for the same purpose, display a diamond or other 

 gem against a background of black velvet. Often there is a spot of 

 brilliant color and one of a contrasting hue just below it, the result

being that first one color, then the other, is flashed forth as the 

 bird changes slightly its position. 



Note to Teochilid^s. — (1) In descriptions of some of the species certain positions 

 of the bird with reference to the eye and the angle of light are designated as "posi- 

 tion a," etc." These positions may be described as follows: 



(2) The vernacular names are mostly taken, with or without modification, from 

 Gould's "Monograph of The Trochilidae. " In some cases it has seemed desirable, 

 for the sake of greater brevity or euphony, to change or modify the names bestowed 

 by Gould, while in the case of forms described since the publication of that magnifi- 

 cent work it has, of course, been necessary to invent new ones. At the best, however, 

 it must be said that (as in the case of other groups of birds) many of these vernacular 

 names are more or less fanciful and of slight utility.

I would exclude from this genus Trochilus chionogaster Tschudi, Leutippus pallidus 

 Taczanowski, Thaumatias'l chlorocercus Gould, and L. viridicauda Sclater and Salvin. 

 The last two of these I have not seen, but they seem to be closely allied to the first 

 and second, which differ in many structural details and also (conspicuously) in colora- 

 tion from Leutippus fallax. The generic name which they should bear is probably 

 Talaphorus Myiarchuslsant (Hist. Nat. Ois.-Mouch., i, 1874, 257), the type of which is 

 Thaumatias? chlorocercus Gould.

 culmen. 



The series examined indicates that at least specimens from southern Honduras, 

 Nicaragua, and Costa Rica require subspecifie separation, P. adolphi proper being 

 restricted to the birds from southeastern Mexico. Examples from Guatemala and 

 British Honduras are intermediate, but with the small number of specimens available 

 for comparison I am unable to decide whether they are nearer the typical or the 

 southern form. Costa Rican and other southern birds are darker than those from 

 southeastern Mexico, especially the adult males, which have the throat much darker

Genus GLAUCIS Boie. 

 Glands Boie, Isis, 1831, 545. (Type, Trochilus hirsutus Gmelin.) 



Medium-sized Trochilidse (length about 100-110 mm.) very 

 similar to Threnetes but differing in more strongly decurved, much less 

 depressed (narrower), and relatively longer bill, wholly nude nasal 

 operculum, unicolored under parts, and basal half of rectrices chest- 

 nut or rufous instead of white or buff. 



Bill rather slender, compressed, scarcely if at all broader than 

 deep basally, distinctly to rather strongly decurved, about twice as 

 long as head, the culmen rounded except for mesorhinal portion, 

 where narrowly ridged; tomia smooth; maxilla and mandible with 

 narrow median grooves. Nostril narrow, slit-like, overhung by a 

 broad, tumid, operculum, feathered only on extreme upper basal 

 portion. Tarsus mostly naked (feathered on upper portion in 

 front), longer than middle toe without claw, the latter slightly longer 

 than both lateral toes; hallux shorter than lateral toes, relatively 

 weak. Wing less than twice as long as exposed culmen, the outer- 

 most primary longest. Tail equal to (sometimes longer than) ex- 

 posed culmen, strongly rounded or nearly graduated, the rectrices 

 narrowly rounded terminally. 



Coloration. — Above metallic bronze or bronze-green, the pileum 

 dull dusky; rectrices (except middle pair) with basal half rufous or 

 chestnut, then black tipped with whitish; under parts plain grayish 

 brown to cinnamon-rufous. Sexes essentially alike. 



Range. — Costa Rica to Guiana, Grenada (Lesser Antilles), Brazil, 

 and Ecuador. (Several species. ) 



a Owing to insufficiency of material I am not able to express an opinon as to the 

 exact number of species which should be recognized; but careful examination of a 

 considerable series (71 specimens) shows that O. hirsute is by no means uniform 

 in characters throughout its range, and that three well-marked forms occur within 

 the geographic limits of this work; namely, (1) a very small form (perhaps specifically 

 distinct), in which (alone) the sexes are apparently always alike in coloration of 

 the under parts and the color of the upper parts always decidedly bronzy, confined 

 to Nicaragua and Costa Rica; (2) a larger form with the adult male always much 

 duller in color of the under parts than the adult female and the upper parts less 

 bronzy, found in Panama and adjacent parts of South America; and (3) a very large 

 form, essentially like the last in coloration, but more closely resembling (and here 

 not separated from) the smaller true G. hirsuta of the adjacent mainland, peculiar 

 to the islands of Trinidad, Tobago, and Grenada. 



A very much larger series of specimens from various parts of South America is 

 required for the proper working out of the geographic variations in this species, and 

 the arrangement here given is to be considered as tentative only.

HAIRY HERMIT. 



Adult male. — Above metallic bronze-green or greenish bronze, duller 

 on pileum, where, especially on forehead and crown, the feathers are 

 dusky basally and on margins, sometimes wholly dusky; upper tail- 

 coverts rather broadly margined terminally with pale buffy grayish 

 or grayish buffy; middle pair of rectrices metallic bronze-green, tipped 

 (usually narrowly) with dull white, the subterminal portion more or 

 less dusky; remaining remiges clear chestnut, crossed by a broad 

 subterminal band of dull black (outer web of lateral rectrix also 

 mostly black), the tip, narrowly, dull white; remiges dusky, faintly 

 glossed with violet-purple; loral, suborbital, and auricular regions 

 dusky, the last faintly glossed with bronze or bronze-green ; under parts 

 dull russet or mars brown (at least on chest), the chin dull whitish, the 

 abdomen pale grayish cinnamon or buffy grayish; under tail-coverts 

 pale cinnamon, becoming still paler on margin, sometimes with an 

 indistinct central area of grayish or olive faintly glossed with bronze- 

 greenish; dusky brown or dull blackish, mandible whitish (pink or 

 reddish in life), passing into dusky at tip; iris dark brown; feet dull 

 yellowish or buffy (in dried skins); length (skins), 109-131 (123); 

 wing, 57.5-68.5 (65.1); tail, 34.5-44.5 (41.2); culmen, 31-35.5 (33.3).°

 broadly and sharply tipped or terminally margined with white; a 

 large and conspicuous tuft of silky white feathers between flanks and 

 rump; bill dull black; iris dark brown; feet dusky; length (skins), 

 104-126 (112); wing, 57-63 (59.7); culmen, 30-36 (33.4). a

 metallic green (similar to but duller and darker than color of back), 

 blackish of chin more extended, sometimes occupying greater part of 

 throat, where the metallic reddish purple is sometimes restricted to a few 

 feathers on extreme lower portion, and gray of under parts slightly

With the material examined I am unable to make out satisfactorily any geographic 

 variations sufficiently marked or constant to warrant the recognition of two or more 

 subspecies. Costa Rican specimens, however, vary more or less toward A. I. pallidi- 

 ceps, some examples being hardly distinguishable from the latter. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 347 



Immature ? — Similar to the adult female but without any metallic 

 purple feathers on throat, which is wholly (centrally at least) dusky, 

 the feathers usually tipped with dull white or grayish. 



Young. — Similar to the supposed immature plumage, as described 

 above, but feathers of upper parts (especially those of rump) more 

 or less distinctly tipped with pale rusty brown or buffy ; throat some- 

 times mostly dull white.

indeed, in the coloration of the under parts (except throat) they are quite like A. c. 

 leocadise of Mexico. It is possible there may have been an error in ascribing the type 

 to Guatemala, for in the dark-colored under parts it is exactly like Costa Rican speci- 

 mens and very different from other Guatemalan ones examined; in which case there 

 would be three geographic forms of this species: A. c. constantii of Costa Rica and 

 Nicaragua, A. c. ? of Guatemala and Salvador, and A. c. leocadise of Mexico.

Rather large Trochilidse (length about 115-125 mm.) with thickened 

 shafts to outer primaries, straight, stout bill much longer than head, 

 long graduated or cuneate tail, and under parts plain light gray. 



Bill about one and a half times as long as head, straight or very 

 nearly so, stout, broad and depressed basally; tomia smooth; man- 

 dible with a median lateral groove, the maxilla with a less distinct 

 lateral groove. Nostril narrow, slit-like, overhung by a very broad, 

 convex, tumid, unfeathered operculum. Tarsus densely feathered, 

 slender, about as long as middle toe, the latter about as long as inner 

 and slightly longer than outer toe; hallux decidedly shorter than 

 outer toe; toes all slender and weak, and claws relatively small, 

 especially that of the hallux. Wing much more than twice as long 

 as bill, the outermost primary longest, the three outermost with 

 shafts thickened basally, especially the outer one, which in adult 

 males has the shaft greatly swollen in middle portion. Tail three- 

 fourths (more or less) as long as wing, graduated for more than one- 

 fourth its length, the rectrices broad but decreasing in width ter- 

 minally, especially the middle pair, which in adult males are abruptly 

 longer than the rest. 



Coloration. — Forehead and crown metallic blue or violet, the rest 

 of upper parts metallic green or bronze-green; lateral rectrices dusky, 

 tipped with dull grayish in females; under parts wholly pale gray.

BIEDS OP NOETH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 357 



Large Trochilidse (length about 1 15-140 mm.) with bill much longer 

 than head, straight to decidedly decurved; tail two-thirds to three- 

 fourths as long as wing, slightly rounded; very weak feet; and shafts 

 of outer primaries thickened basally (in adult males excessively so). 



Bill slightly longer than head (in C. Tiyperythrus) to one and a half 

 times as long, straight (C. Tiyperythrus, 0. rufus, C. largipennis, and 

 0. ooscurus) to decidedly decurved (0. ensipennis, C. Tiemileucurus, 

 0. lazulus, and C. mllavicencio) ; tomia smooth; both mandible and 

 maxilla with a distinct lateral groove, the former on basal half, mainly. 

 Nostril narrow, slit-like, overhung by a broad, convex, tumid, mostly 

 unfeathered membrane, but frontal feathering reaching to or beyond 

 middle of upper portion. Tarsus densely feathered, slender, about as 

 long as anterior toes; middle and inner toes equal in length, the inner 

 very slightly shorter; hallux decidedly shorter than outer toe; middle 

 toe united to outer for whole of its basal phalanx, to inner toe for 

 less that distance; all the toes weak and slender, and claws rela- 

 tively small. Wing about three times as long as exposed culmen, the 

 outermost primary longest; three outer primaries with shafts more 

 or less thickened basally, especially in adult males, in which the shaft 

 of the outermost is greatly enlarged and strongly bowed toward 

 middle portion. Tail two-thirds to three-fourths as long as wing, 

 slightly rounded, the rectrices very broad, rounded terminally (in 

 C. dbscurus tapering and pointed terminally). 



Coloration. — a. Saepiopterus : Metallic green or green and violet 

 above, the tail black, with lateral rectrices extensively white termi- 

 nally, or (in C. lazulus) chestnut tipped with green; adult males with 

 under parts metallic blue or violet, or green with violet throat; adult 

 females with under parts gray mixed with green on sides and blue on 

 throat, o. Campylopterus : Above metallic bronze green, including 

 middle rectrices, the outer rectrices blackish with broad white tips; 

 beneath wholly light gray; sexes alike. (C. largipennis, C. obscurus.) 

 c. Platystylopterus : Above metallic bronze green, the middle rec- 

 trices greenish bronze or golden bronze; other rectrices (at least in 

 part) light cinnamon-rufous; under parts whoUy light cinnamon- 

 rufous. Sexes alike, or very nearly so. 



Although for present purposes it may be as well to retain the genus 

 Campylopterus with its generally recognized limits I am convinced 

 that the genus as so recognized is not a natural group, but a combina- 

 tion of at least two and probably three generic groups, as indicated in 

 the paragraph describing coloration. The species with uniform gray 

 under parts (in both sexes) closely resemble those of the genus Pampa 

 in coloration (except for the absence of a blue or violet frontal patch), 

 and the relationship is still further indicated by the form of the rec- 

 trices in C. obscurus, for, while the tail is slightly rounded (not gradu- 




358 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



ated, as in Pampd) the rectrices are distinctly narrowed terminally. 

 The bill, moreover, in all the species of the group (true Campylopterus) 

 is straight, as in Pampa, though less broad and depressed basally. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES OF CAMPYLOPTEBUS. 



a. Under parts metallic blue or violet (adult male), dusky (young male), or gray with 

 blue on throat (female); lateral rectrices broadly tipped with white. (South-

Genus PH^OCHROA Gould. 



Phseochroa " Gould, Introd. Troch., oct. ed., 1861, 55. (Type, Trochilus cuvieri 

 Delattre and Bourcier.) 



Rather large Trochilidae (length about 115-120 mm.) with bill 

 slightly longer than head, strong, nearly straight, narrowly cuneate 

 in vertical profile ; wing about three times as long as exposed culmen, 

 the outer primary longest, its shaft more or less thickened toward 

 base, especially in adult males; tail more than three-fifths as long 

 as wing, slightly or moderately rounded, the rectrices rather broad 

 but contracted terminally where narrowly rounded; plumage very 

 dull — dull metallic bronze-green above, pale dull bronze-greenish on 

 anterior under parts, the posterior under parts pale grayish buffy; 

 lateral rectrices dull black, broadly tipped with white or whitish. 

 Sexes alike in color. 



Bill slightly to decidedly longer than head, stout, nearly straight, 

 broader than deep (except terminally), narrowly cuneate in vertical 

 profile; tomia smooth; culmen indistinctly ridged (distinctly so 

 basally); maxilla and mandible with lateral sulci rather indistinct. 

 Nostril narrow, slit-like, overhung by a rather narrow, straight- 

 edged (or at least not distinctly convex) operculum, feathered on 

 its upper and posterior portions. Tarsus feathered only on upper 

 anterior portion, rather stout, slightly shorter than middle and inner 

 toes, these equal in length, the outer slightly shorter; hallux slightly 

 shorter than anterior toes; middle toe united to outer for whole of 

 its basal phalanx, to inner toe for nearly as much; toes and claws 

 moderately strong. Wing at least three times as long as exposed 

 culmen, the outermost primary longest, its shaft very rigid, more or 

 less thickened basally (especially in adult males). Tail more than 

 three-fifths as long as wing, slightly to moderately rounded, the 

 rectrices rather broad but somewhat abruptly contracted terminally 

 into a rounded point. 



Coloration. — Dull bronze-green above, paler dull bronze-green 

 anteriorly beneath, with pale dull buffy margins to feathers, the 

 abdomen plain dull buffy, the under tail-coverts bronzy grayish, 

 margined with white; lateral rectrices black, broadly tipped with 

 white or whitish. Sexes alike in color.

BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 363 



Range. — Guatemala to Colombia and Venezuela. (Two species.) 

 While closely resembling, superficially, the type species of Aphan- 

 tochroa Gould, this genus differs in relatively longer tail (more, 

 instead of less, than three-fifths as long as wing), ridged instead of 

 rounded culmen, and less distinct lateral sulci of maxilla and mandi- 

 ble. The coloration is very similar but Aphantochroa lacks the 

 white tips to the lateral rectrices, so conspicuous in both sexes of 

 both species of Phseochroa. The two groups are, however, very 

 closely related, and Phseochroa undoubtedly is more nearly allied to 

 Aphantochroa than to Campylopterus. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OP PBLEOCHROA. 



a. Basal half (approximately) of mandible pale brownish or whitish (reddish or 

 pinkish in life); lateral rectrices extensively bronze-greenish basally. (Phseo-

PHSEOCHROA CUVIERn CUVDERH (Delattre and Bourcier). 



CUVIER'S HUMMING BIRD. 



Adults (sexes alike). — Above metallic bronze-green (sometimes 

 more bronzy posteriorly), the tail usually more bluish or silvery green; 

 lateral pair of rectrices extensively grayish white terminally (usually 

 tinged on outer web with gray), a this separated from the bronze- 

 greenish basal portion by an ill-defined band of dull blackish or 

 - dusky, the second pair with a less extensive, but still conspicuous, 

 whitish tip, the third sometimes slightly tipped with grayish; remiges 

 dark brownish slate or dusky, faintly glossed with purplish; chin, 

 throat, chest, and sides of breast rather dull metallic bronze or bronze- 

 green, the feathers narrowly margined with dull grayish buffy or pale 

 buffy grayish; flanks, abdomen, and median fine of breast pale 

 isabella color or pale, dull brownish buffy, the first glossed with 

 bronze or bronze-green; femoral tufts and tuft on each side of rump 

 white, the latter usually intermixed with pale grayish; under tail- 

 coverts dull metallic bronze or bronze-greenish, broadly margined 

 with white; bill dull black, the basal half (more or less) of mandible 

 pale brownish or whitish (fleshy or pinkish in life) ; iris dark brown, 

 feet dusky. 



a Sometimes there is a bronze-dusky spot at tip of outer web.

Phxoptila & Gould, Mon. Troch., v, July, 1861, text to pi. 340; Introd. Troch., 

 oct. ed., 1861, 169. (Type, Cyanomyia(1) sordida Gould.) 



Similar to Oynanihus but tail relatively longer, feet relatively 

 stouter, under parts brownish gray in both sexes, and coloration of 

 upper parts very dull. 



Bill much longer than head, depressed, broad at base, faintly 

 decurved; culmen broadly rounded but contracted into a narrow 

 ridge basally; tomia smooth; both maxilla and mandible with a 

 narrow lateral median sulcus, that of the former indistinct, however. 

 Nasal operculum broad, tumid, unfeathered, the frontal feathering 

 forming a transverse line across base of forehead. Tarsus slender, 

 with upper portion feathered; anterior toes about equal in length, 

 the hallux slightly shorter, all the toes slender, with claws relatively 

 small. Wing less than three times as long as exposed culmen, the

BIRDS OP NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 367 



outermost primary longest. Tail more than half as long as wing, 

 slightly" double-rounded, the rectrices broad, rounded at tip. 



Coloration. — Above, including tail, plain olivaceous glossed with 

 bronze or bronze-green; beneath plain brownish gray; a dusky 

 auricular or suborbital spot; sexes essentially alike, but female with 

 a .broad subterminal area of black and terminal area of gray or 

 brown on lateral rectrices. 



Range. — Mexican plateau. (Monotypic.) 



Authorities have disagreed widely as to the relationship of this form, 

 Elliot placing it near Doleromyia ( = Leucippus) (a South American 

 genus) and placing by far the greater number of genera between it and 

 Cynanthus ("IacJie"), while Hartert unite's it with the latter. I 

 agree with Hartert in considering it most closely related to the latter, 

 but would separate it generically on account of the differences men- 

 tioned in the above diagnosis. 



PH-ffiOPTILA SORDIDA (Gould). 



DUSKY HUMMING BIRD. 



Adult male. — Above dull metallic bronze-green or greenish bronze, 

 usually much duller (sometimes dull brownish gray or grayish 

 brown) on forehead and crown and on upper tail-coverts; tail dull 

 greenish bronze or grayish brown glossed with greenish bronze, the 

 rectrices dusky basally, this occupying more than basal half of 

 lateral rectrix; remiges purplish dusky, the outermost primary nar- 

 rowly edged with pale gray or grayish white; a pale gray or grayish 

 white postocular spot, and beneath this a poorly defined dusky 

 area extending to beneath eye; under parts deep sooty gray (nearly 

 mouse gray), deepest on throat, the feathers of which usually have 

 a darker subterminal (concealed) area; femoral tufts and tuft on 

 each side of rump white; shorter under tail-coverts brownish gray, 

 the longer ones mostly buffy; bill brownish (reddish in life), passing 

 into dusky terminally (more or less extensively); iris dark brown;

 35-35.5 (35.3); culmen, 27.5-29 (28.3).° 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male but four lateral rectrices 

 (on each side) bronzy green (duller and more grayish on lateral 

 rectrix) crossed by a broad subterminal band of dull blue-blackish 

 and tipped with pale brownish gray or grayish brown (most broadly 

 on outermost rectrix); remiges paler and less purplish dusky, and 

 gray of under parts averaging slightly paler than in adult male; 

 length (skins), 101-103 (102); wing, 55; tail, 31.5-32 (31.7); cul-

Three adult males from the extreme southeastern portion of the range of the species 

 (Jaumave, Tamaulipas; Hacienda Angostura, San Lufs Potosl, and Valley of Mexico) 

 differ from all others in the collection in the decidedly greenish blue of the throat, 

 which is colored nearly as in the adult male of C. lawrencei. Should other specimens 

 from the same geographic area agree with these in this respect, a southeastern form 

 would undoubtedly require recognition. Unfortunately no other specimens are 

 available for examination. 



Specimens from jfche state of Sinaloa average considerably smaller than those from 

 other localities, but those from Colima, Guerrero, and Arizona are nearly as small, and 

 at present, in the light of material examined, I hardly feel justified in accepting a 

 subspecies C. I. magicus for the Sinaloa birds. It may be, however, that more satisfac- 

 tory material will show that two, possibly three, forms can be satisfactorily defined.

CYNANTHUS LAWRENCEI (Berlepsch.) 



LAWRENCE'S HUMMING BIRD. 



Similar to O. latirostris but smaller, with shorter bill; adult male 

 with chin and throat slightly bluish green (never blue), back and 

 rump more bronzy, and under tail-coverts dusky centrally; adult 



° The type of Hylocharis magica (in the collection of the American Myiarchusseum of 

 Natural History) is a mounted specimen, and differs very much in coloration from 

 other specimens, the usual bronze-green of the upper parts being replaced by a 

 rather dull purplish or coppery bronze, that of the under parts strongly tinged with 

 the same, and the blue of the throat replaced by bluish green. The plumage has, 

 however, every appearance of having been affected by the action of light or, possibly, 

 immersion in spirits; at any rate, the coloration is certainly abnormal.

female with, basal half (more or less) of lateral rectrices brownish 

 gray instead of bronze-green and middle rectrices darker and much 

 duller bronze-green. 



Adult male. — Pileum and hindneck metallic bronze-green passing 

 into greenish bronze, bronze, or coppery bronze on back, scapulars, 

 wing-coverts, and rump; upper tail-coverts dusky brownish gray 

 (sometimes partly bronzy); tail slightly glossy blue-black, the four 

 middle rectrices tipped with deep brownish gray, the remaining 

 rectrices . narrowly edged and terminally margined with the same; 

 remiges dull slate color, faintly glossed with purplish, the outermost 

 primary narrowly edged with pale gray or grayish white; chin and 

 throat bright metallic emerald green (more bluish green, but never 

 blue, anteriorly), passing into metallic bronze-green on rest of under 

 parts; anal tufts and tuft on each side of rump white; under tail- 

 coverts grayish white with a large subterminal spot of slightly glossy 

 bluish dusky or blue-blackish; terminal half (more or less) of maxilla 

 dull black, the basal portion brownish (reddish in life) ; mandible pale 

 brownish (reddish in life), passing into blackish terminally; iris dark 

 brown; feet dusky; length (skins), 86-94 (91); wing, 51-53. 5 (51.7);

 subterminally; remaining rectrices with basal half (more or less) 

 dull bronze-green, then bluish black, the tip (broadly on outermost) 

 brownish gray — -the outermost rectrix with brownish gray (darker 

 basally) replacing bronze-green; under parts sooty gray or deep 

 drab-gray, slightly paler on chin, the sides (including sides of neck) 

 conspicuously glossed or spotted with metallic bronze-green; femoral 

 tufts and tuft on each side of rump white; under tail-coverts brown- 

 ish gray passing into grayish white on margins, sometimes with a 

 subterminal mesial streak of dusky; a small pale gray or grayish 

 white postocular spot, and beneath this a dusky space extending to 

 beneath eye; bill, etc., as in adult male, but maxilla mostly (some-

BOTJBLEDAY'S HUMMING BIRD. 



Myiarchusch smaller than G latirostris or G. lawrencei (wing not more 

 than 51 mm.) ; adult male with pileum much more brilliant metallic 

 green than back, under parts more extensively and decidedly blue, 

 and under tail-coverts black (glossed with blue or green), with or 

 without pale gray or grayish white margins; adult female with basal 

 half of rectrices less distinctly bronze-greenish. 



Adult male. — Forehead and crown brilliant metallic bluish green, 

 usually decidedly more bluish on forehead, sometimes wholly uni- 

 form emerald green ; a occiput and hindneck metallic grass-green 

 (more bronzy in worn plumage); back, scapulars, wing-coverts, and 

 rump bronze-green, usually duller (sometimes inclining to brownish 

 gray) on rump; upper tail-coverts varying from dull bronze-green 

 to dusky; tail glossy blue-black, the six middle rectrices tipped with 

 deep brownish gray (more broadly on middle pair) ; remiges purplish 

 dusky; chin and throat bright metallic blue or violet-blue, passing 

 into less bright metallic bluish green on under parts of body, usually 

 more decidedly bluish along median line, the sides of breast more 

 bronzy green; femoral tufts and tuft on each side of rump white; 

 under tail-coverts varying from uniform blue-black to dusky glossed 

 with green or bluish and more or less margined or tipped with pale 

 gray or grayish white; bill brownish (reddish in life) passing into 

 dusky terminally; iris dark brown; feet dusky; length (skins), 75-92 

 (84); wing, 46-51 (47.8); tail, 28-34 (30.7); middle rectrices 20-23

Adult female. — Above metallic bronze-green, usually much duller 

 (often dull grayish brown or brownish gray) on forehead and crown; 



a This variation in color of the forehead and crown appears to be principally if not 

 wholly due to difference in age of the plumage, all specimens examined in which the 

 plumage is evidently old or considerably affected by wear or exposure having the 

 forehead and crown uniform green, while those in fresh plumage have the forehead 

 distinctly blue and the crown bluish green.

 ences. The alleged type of Trochilus doubledayi Bourcier, in the collection of the 

 American Myiarchusseum of Natural History, agrees with the Guerrero series, both in size 

 and coloration; consequently if two forms are to be recognized that from Oaxaca 

 requires a new name, Iache ntiida Salvin being unquestionably a synonym of T. 

 doubledayi.

 of the American Myiarchusseum of Natural History, New York City.

 culmen broadly rounded but contracted basally into a narrow meso- 

 rhinal ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with a rather distinct median 

 lateral groove. Nasal operculum broad, very tumid, wholly nude,

 no black or white markings on head, and tail uniform bright metallic 

 golden, bronze, coppery, or blue-black. 



Bill decidedly longer than head, depressed, broad basally, very 

 slightly decurved; culmen broadly rounded, but contracted into a 

 narrow ridge basally; tomia smooth; a more or less distinct narrow 

 median groove along sides of mandible, and more or less distinct 

 indication of a similar groove on maxilla. Nasal operculum broad, 

 tumid, completely nude, the frontal feathering forming a transverse 

 line across base of forehead or (in H. grayi) forming two very slight 

 antias. Tarsus feathered for upper portion, at least in front; middle 

 and inner toes about equal in length, the outer slightly shorter; 

 hallux shorter than outer toe. Wing nearly three times as long as 

 exposed culmen, the outermost primary longest. Tail more than 

 half as long as wing, slightly rounded or double-rounded, the rectrices 

 broad, with rounded tip. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green or bronze-green (sometimes 

 with head or at least forehead blue or violet) , the tail very bright 

 metallic golden, golden-green, bronze, or dark chestnut with middle 

 rectrices and upper coverts copper bronze, or else uniform blue- 

 black; adult males with under parts of body metallic green or bronze, 

 the throat bronze, green, blue, or violet, the chin sometimes rufous.

 base, the outer web of pair next to middle sometimes almost wholly 

 bronzy; remiges dull brownish slate or dusky, faintly glossed with 

 purplish, the inner secondaries mostly metallic grass green; under 

 parts metallic dark emerald green or clear metallic grass green, the 

 feathers grayish basally and crossed by a subterminal bar (con- 

 cealed) of white or grayish white, and narrowly margined with pale 

 grayish, forming a squamated appearance when viewed from be-

I am by no means satisfied that all the above-mentioned specimens represent a 

 single form. Six males (three fully adult, three evidently immature) from the 

 Santa Myiarchusrta district of Colombia have the middle rectrices wholly metallic bronze 

 or greenish bronze and the remaining rectrices (except the outermost) broadly edged 

 with the same, at least basally. On the other hand, fully adult as well as immature 

 males from the lower Myiarchusgdalena and Bogota districts and those from Venezuela have 

 the middle rectrices either very dull bronzy or blackish faintly glossed basally with 

 bronzy, while two from PanamA (the only ones seen from that district) have the 

 middle pair of rectrices wholly blue-black like the rest of the tail, and the upper 

 tail-coverts purplish bronze. The series examined is, however, much too small to 

 enable one to decide the question properly.

Eupherusa nigriventris Lawrence.) 

 Callipharus Elliot, Classif. and Synop. Troch., 1879, 211. (Type, Eupherusa 



nigriventris Lawrence.) 



Small Trochilidse (length about 75-78 mm.) related to Eupherusa, 

 but tail more strongly rounded; the adult male with head and under 

 parts velvety black. 



Bill about as long as head, straight, terete, but rather broad and 

 depressed basally; culmen rounded but basally (between nasal 

 operculi) contracted into a distinct ridge; terminal portion of max- 

 illary tomium minutely serrate ; mandible with a distinct lateral median 

 groove or sulcus. Nasal operculum very broad and tumid, mostly 

 unfeathered, only the upper-posterior portion covered by frontal 

 feathering, which, anteriorly, forms a convex line across base of fore- 

 head. Tarsus densely clothed with short feathers; middle toe 

 apparently very slightly longer than both lateral toes, the hallux 

 shorter than the latter. Wing three times as long as culmen, or a 

 little more, the outermost primary longest. Tail more than half as 

 long as wing, rounded, the rectrices moderately broad, rather soft. 



Coloration. — Hindneck, back, scapulars, wing-coverts, and rump 

 metallic bronze-green or greenish bronze; secondaries cinnamon- 

 rufous or chestnut, tipped with dusky (as in Eupherusa) ; lateral rec- 

 trices white. Adult male with head and under parts (except under 

 tail-coverts) uniform velvety black, the under tail-coverts white; 

 adult female with under parts pale gray, the pileum dusky, faintly 

 glossed with greenish. 



Range. — Costa Rica and western Panama. (Monotypic.) 

 t Although referred to Elvira by Dr. Hartert, the single species 

 constituting the genus Callipharus differs in the presence of minute 

 serrations to the terminal portion of the maxillary tomium, rufous 

 secondaries, and rounded tail, in all of which characters it agrees 

 with Eupherusa and not with Elvira. Were it not for the strikingly 

 different and quite unique coloration of the adult male, involving 

 structural differences in the feathers of the pileum and under parts 

 (which are beautifully blended and velvety instead of harsh and con- 

 spicuously imbricated and squamate), and the decidedly more rounded 

 tail, it might well be merged with Eupherusa. Considering all its pe- 

 culiarities, I feel sure that Callipharus should stand alone in any 

 arrangement of the family which does not involve a very great 

 reduction in the number of genera.

Small Trochilidse (length about 75 mm.) closely resembling Euphe- 

 rusa, but with maxillary tomium entirely smooth," the bill relatively 

 smaller (rather shorter than head), tail double-rounded or emarginate 

 and secondaries green and dusky, instead of cinnamon-rufous. 



Bill rather shorter than head, nearly terete, straight (E. chionura) 

 or distinctly decurved (E. cupreiceps); culmen rounded except basally, 

 where contracted into a distinct ridge; tomia smooth;" mandible with 

 lateral median groove indistinct. Nasal operculum rather narrow, 

 tumid, mostly unfeathered, the frontal feathering extending on each 

 side of culmen to about the middle of nasal operculi. Tarsus feath- 

 ered; middle and inner toes about equal in length, the outer slightly 

 shorter, the hallux slightly shorter than outer toe. Wing decidedly 

 more than three times as long as exposed culmen, the outermost

primary longest. Tail half as long as wing (E. cupreiceps) to more 

 than half as long (E. chionura), emarginate, double-rounded, or 

 rounded (in female of E. cupreiceps), the rectrices rather broad and 

 soft. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green, bronze-green or (in E. cuprei- 

 ceps) bronze passing into purple or copper bronze on head and upper 

 tail-coverts; lateral rectrices white, tipped with black or grayish or 

 (in females) crossed by a subterminal band of the same. Adult males 

 with under parts bright metallic green, the under tail-coverts (ab- 

 domen also in E. chionura) white; adult females grayish white beneath, 

 spotted or spangled with metallic green. 



Range. — Costa Rica and western Panama. (Two species.) 

 The two species which, so far as known, constitute this group are 

 quite different in certain structural details, and are scarcely strictly 

 congeneric. Except for its green and dusky (instead of cinnamon- 

 rufous) secondaries and emarginate (instead of truncate or slightly 

 rounded) tail and absence of minute serrations on maxillary tomium 

 E. chionura might well be placed in Eupherusa. E. cupreiceps, on 

 the other hand, has a distinctly decurved as well as much more slender 

 bill, and the tail is relatively shorter (not more than half as long as 

 wing). 



KEY TO THE SPECIES OF ELVIKA.

Medium-sized TrochilidsB (length about 95-110 mm.), with the 

 straight or very faintly decurved stout bill much broader than deep, 

 longer than head, distinctly widened basally; nasal operculum thick 

 or tumid, with more than anterior half exposed; tail nearly truncated 

 to slightly double-rounded or emarginate, and tail rufous-chestnut, 

 olive-bronzy, or dull greenish bronze, darker subterminally. 



Bill decidedly longer than head (more than one-third but much 

 less than one-half as long as wing), straight or very faintly decurved, 

 stout, much broader than deep, abruptly widened basally; nasal 

 operculum rather thick or tumid, exposed for much the greater part; 

 wing normal; tail between one-half and two-thirds as long as wing, 

 nearly truncate, slightly double-rounded, or emarginate; tarsi 

 feathered; outer toe nearly as long as middle toe, the inner decidedly 

 shorter. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green, bronze-green, or bronzy, the 

 pileum sometimes violet-blue; tail rufous-chestnut, olive-bronzy, or 

 dark bronze-greenish; under parts varying from mostly green, with 

 cinnamon-rufous or white abdomen to wholly cinnamon-rufous or 

 entirely white. Sexes alike. 



Range. — Northern Mexico to Peru. (Twenty-three species.) 



I am not able to give a better diagnosis of this genus for the reason 

 that its limits are very indefinite, and its relations to Agyrtria and 

 Saucerottia uncertain. Either the three so-called genera must be 

 combined into one, or each of them must be further restricted and a 

 considerable number of genera recognized before their definition can 

 be made more precise. Even as here restricted I have been obliged 

 to place in Amizilis not only certain species formerly referred to 

 Uranomitra Reichenbach (e. g. V. violiceps and U. viridifrons) , in this 

 following Hartert, but also two species of Agyrtria (A. tephrocephala 

 and A. maculicavda) , which, so far as I am able to see, while agreeing 

 with true Agyrtria in coloration, at the same time agree minutely in 

 shape of the bill and nasal operculi with typical Amizilis. In short, 



a "Von nufifc (rothlich) und <j>a,lvu) (leuchten, glanzen)." (Cabanis and Heine.) 

 & "Von ipawoc (lieblich, anmuthig)." (Heine.) 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 407 



the group of species composing the three so-called genera here tenta- 

 tively recognized constitute a very difficult problem, for, apparently, 

 no matter whether they are combined into a single genus or divided 

 into several the definition of the group or groups is equally difficult in 

 either case.

a The only specimen examined corresponding in plumage to the fully adult male 

 as described above is from Acahuitzotla, Guerrero, and represents the so-called 

 Cyanomyia guerrertnm Salvin and Godman. All others examined lack both the 

 dark blue forehead and buffy tip to the rectrices. I am fully convinced, however, 

 that these bluish fronted specimens are neither -specifically nor subspecifically dis- 

 tinct from the greenish fronted ones, for the reason that the two occur in the same 

 locality, both being represented from Acahuitzotla. Whether the apparently adult 

 males with greenish forehead are in reality females wrongly sexed, are younger males, 

 or merely represent individual variation can be determined only from more ample 

 material.

This species has been recorded as a North American bird on account of its alleged 

 accidental occurrence at Cambridge, Myiarchusssachusetts; but the circumstances, as related, 

 strongly indicate substitution (perhaps accidental), by the taxidermist, of a trade 

 skin of this species for a specimen of the common Archilochus colubris. 



a Twenty-three specimens. 



6 According to the material examined, the majority of adult females are absolutely 

 similar in coloration to adult males.

Medium-sized to rather small Trochilidae (length about 85-95 mm.) 

 closely related to Amizilis and Agyrtria, but differing (especially from 

 the former) in narrower bill, scarcely widened at base, thinner (less 

 tumid) and less exposed nasal operculi, and (usually) more deeply 

 emarginate, black or dark steel blue (but sometimes bronzy) tail. 



Bill slightly to decidedly longer than head, straight or very faintly 

 decurved, rather slender, narrow (not conspicuously wider than deep), 

 not noticeably widened basally; nasal operculi thin, with only outer 

 and anterior halves exposed; wing normal; tail slightly to decidedly 

 more than half as long as wing, more or less deeply emarginate, with 

 outermost pair of rectrices usually longest, but sometimes shorter 

 than next pair; tarsi feathered; outer toe about equal to middle toe, 

 the inner toe slightly shorter, or lateral toes about equal and both 

 slightly shorter than middle toe. 



Coloration. — Above rather dark metallic green, the upper tail- 

 coverts or rump (or both) sometimes coppery or reddish bronze, the 

 pileum sometimes (in one species) dark metallic blue; tail usually 

 dark steel blue or blackish, sometimes bronzy; under parts (except 

 under tail-coverts) metallic green, the femoral tufts and leg feathers 

 (sometimes whole abdomen) white. Sexes alike. 



Range. — Mexico to Ecuad6r, Venezuela, Tobago, and Granada.

While doubtful whether the bird whose characters are given above is the true 

 S. iodura, which, judging from the colored figures on which the name is based and 

 descriptions by authors, seems more like S. viridigaster, I nevertheless feel sure that 

 it can not represent an extreme variation of the latter, being much too different in 

 coloration of the tail. I have seen but one specimen, a "Bogota" skin, in the collec- 

 tion of the U. S. National Myiarchusseum.

SAUCEROTTIA CYANURA GUATEMALA Dearborn. 



GUATEMALAN BLUE-TAILED HUMMING BIRD. 



Similar to S. c. cyanura, but much darker in color, especially the 

 wings; primaries blue-black instead of violet-dusky; chestnut on 

 basal portion of remiges darker and much more restricted; green of 

 upper parts darker, and blue of tail more violaceous, especially on 

 basal portion of outer webs of rectrices, where the color sometimes 

 inclines to metallic purple, the under tail-coverts almost wholly blue- 

 black or dark steel blue, or else margined with darker grayish or 

 chestnut. 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 92-100 (97); wing, 53-56 (54.5); tail,

ANTHRACOTHORAX AURULENTUS (Audebert and Vieillot). 



PORTO EICAN MANGO. 



Similar to A. dominicus but decidedly smaller; adult male with 

 black of under parts confined to chest and breast, and middle rectrices 

 usually much more coppery bronze; adult female with basal portion 

 of lateral rectrices light grayish, or partly so, instead of more than 

 basal half wholly chestnut-rufous, B black of subterminal portion 

 brightly glossed with bluish green, and under parts more extensively 

 and uniformly grayish, the sides without green spotting or inter- 

 mixture. 



Adult male. — Above metallic greenish bronze, golden bronze, or 

 (more rarely) coppery bronze or bronze-green, the middle rectrices 

 dull blackish bronze to bright coppery bronze; tail (except middle 

 rectrices) dark violet-chestnut or maroon-violet glossed with metallic 

 violet-purple, the rectrices broadly margined terminally with glossy 

 steel-blue; remiges dull slate-blackish or dusky faintly glossed with 

 violet-bluish; chin and throat metallic greenish bronze to golden 

 bronze; chest and upper breast opaque velvety black, passing into 

 dull brownish gray on sides, flanks, and lower abdomen; under tail- 

 coverts dusky brownish gray, usually more blackish sub terminally, 

 usually margined (more or less distinctly) with paler, and faintly 

 glossed with violet; conspicuous femoral and lumbar tufts white; 

 bill black; iris dark brown; feet blackish; length (skins), 105-111 

 (108); wing, 59-65 (62.5); tail, 32-39 (36.7); culmen, 21-25 (22.9). 6 



Adult female. — Above metallic bronze-green to golden bronze, 

 usually much duller on forehead and crown; middle rectrices dull 

 bronze-green to bright bronze (rarely coppery bronze), usually darker 

 (sometimes blackish) terminally; other rectrices brownish gray 

 (rarely partly chestnut on inner webs) basally, steel blue subtermi- 

 nally, and tipped with white (broadly on lateral rectrices); remiges 

 slate-blackish or dusky, faintly glossed with violet-bluish; under 

 parts pale brownish gray, paler (sometimes dull white) on chin and 

 throat, passing into white on abdomen and anal region, the sides some- 

 times slightly intermixed with metallic bronze or bronze-green; under 

 tail-coverts pale gray centrally, margined with white; bill, etc., as in 



<* A few specimens have the basal half of the lateral rectrices mostly chestnut-rufous, 

 but these I think are immature males; one of them certainly is, the collector having 

 taken pains to emphasize the determination of sex.

ANTHRACOTHORAX VIRIDIS (Audebert and Vieillot). 



GREEN MANGO. 



Adults (sexes alike). a — Above metallic green, bronze-green, or 

 (rarely) bronze, duller on pileum, the lower rump and upper tail- 

 coverts purer green (metallic grass green or sea green) ; tail metallic 

 blue-black or dark steel blue, the lateral rectrices sometimes very 

 narrowly margined at tip with grayish or grayish white; remiges 

 dusky brownish slate, very faintly glossed with violet; under parts 

 metallic bluish green (french green or between grass green and sea 

 green), the under tail-coverts sometimes narrowly margined ter- 

 minally with whitish; femoral and lumbar tufts white (the latter 

 small and concealed); bill black; iris dark brown; feet dusky. 



Young. — Not materially different in coloration from adults, but 

 some specimens, at least, have the feathers of the under parts narrowly 

 and very indistinctly margined terminally with pale grayish brown, 

 or else have the green of the anterior under parts darker and duller. 6 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 107-116 (111); wing, 60-67 (63.9); 

 tail, 35.5-38.5 (37); culmen, 23-25 (24.2). e 



Adult female. — Length (skins), 104-117 (112); wing, 58.5-63 

 (60.1); tail, 33.5-37 (35.1); culmen, 25-27 (25.9).<* 



Island of Porto Rico, Greater Antilles (El Yunque; Adjuntas; 

 Utuado; Lares; Myiarchusyaguez). 



2 Not only have Gould (Monog. Troch., ii) but also Elliot, Cory, Salvin (Cat. Birds 

 Brit. Myiarchuss., xvi, 100), and Hartert (Tierreich, Aves, Lief. 9, 100) described the 

 adult female of this species as being pale gray beneath. Undoubtedly they are 

 wrong, for all the specimens sexed as female in the U. S. National Myiarchusseum (one of 

 them with the determination of sex emphasized) are precisely like adult males in 

 coloration, and even a young bird which had not yet left the nest (a male, however) 

 is not appreciably different! Numerous specimens in the U. S. National Myiarchusseum 

 corresponding with the descriptions of the alleged female of A. viridis by the authors 

 mentioned undoubtedly belong to A. aurulentus, the adult female of which has little 

 if any chestnut or rufous on the rectrices. 



b A nestling (determined to be a male by dissection) is in this plumage. 



c Ten specimens.

Genus SERICOTES Reichenbach. 

 r Anthracothorax] y. Sericotes Reichenbach, Aufz. der Colib., 1854, 11. (Type, 

 Trochilus holosericeus Linnaeus.) 



Rather large Trochilidae (length about 100-120 mm.) very closely 

 related to Eulampis, but differing in more naked tarsi, rounded, 

 instead of emarginate, tail and very different coloration, the remiges 

 nonmetallic, and general coloration green, the upper tail-coverts blue 

 and a blue or violet patch on chest. 



Bill longer than head, rather stout, nearly terete but broader than 

 deep at base, distinctly decurved; culmen rounded but basally con- 

 tracted into a narrow ridge; terminal portion of maxillary tomium 

 minutely serrate; mandible with a broad longitudinal median groove. 

 Nasal operculum narrow, concealed by dense appressed frontal feath- 

 ering, which extends to or slightly beyond anterior end of nostril, 

 forming a short and narrow point or antia on each side of mesorhin- 

 ium. Tarsus naked except for upper frontal portion; middle and 

 inner toes about equal in length, the outer slightly shorter, the hallux 

 shorter than outer toe. Wing about three times as long as exposed 

 culmen, the outermost primary longest. Tail decidedly more than 

 half as long as wing, slightly but distinctly rounded, the rectrices 

 broad, with nearly truncate tip, the lateral rectrices strongly incurved. 



Coloration. — General color green (brighter below), but this relieved 

 by a blue or violet jugular patch, the tail-coverts also blue or greenish 

 blue; tail blue-black or violet-black. Sexes alike.

 greenish), the under surface more violaceous-black, tipped with blue- 

 black or dark steel blue; remiges dusky, faintly glossed with viola- 

 ceous, the inner secondaries more strongly glossed with greenish; 

 malar region, chin, throat, and foreneck bright metallic yellowish 

 green (apple green to light grass green), passing on sides of chest into 

 a more bluish green and this on center of chest into blue or greenish 

 blue, forming a more or less well-defined patch; under parts of body 

 black, glossed, more or less distinctly, with bluish green, green, or 

 bronzy; under tail-coverts bright metallic green or bluish green, with a 

 subterminal area of blue or violet-blue; femoral andlumbar tufts white; 

 bill dull black; iris dark brown; feet dusky; length (skins), 99-121

Genus EULAMPIS Boie. 



Eulampis Boie, Isis, 1831, 547. (Type, Trochilus jugularis Linnaeus.) 

 Culampis (typographical error?) Lesson, Ind. Gen. Troch., 1832, p. vii. 



Rather large Trochilidse (length about 115-125 mm.); upper parts 

 and under parts of body velvety black, tail-coverts bright metallic 

 bluish green, wings bright metallic bronze-green, and throat and 

 chest soft metallic reddish purple. 



Bill longer than head, rather stout, strongly decurved, nearly 

 terete, but decidedly broader than deep basally; culmen rounded but 

 basally contracted into a narrow ridge; terminal portion of maxillary 

 tomium minutely serrate; mandible with a distinct • lateral median 

 broad groove or sulcus. Nasal operculum narrow, hidden by dense 

 frontal feathering, the latter extending to or slightly beyond ante- 

 rior end of nostril, forming a distinct point or antia on each side of 

 mesorhinium. Tarsus stout, densely feathered, except lower and 

 posterior portions; lateral toes equal in length, decidedly shorter than 

 middle toe, the hallux as long as lateral toes or very slightly shorter. 

 Wing more than three times as long as exposed culmen, the outer- 

 most primary longest. Tail about' half as long as wing, emarginate, 

 the rectrices very broad, with broadly rounded tip, the lateral ones 

 strongly incurved; upper tail-coverts very large and broad. 



" A specimen said to be from the Island of Nevis is mentioned in the text, but the 

 locality is certainly erroneous.

Bill shorter than head to decidedly longer, straight or slightly 

 decurved, nearly terete but slightly depressed basally; culmen 

 rounded, but contracted at base into a narrow ridge; tomia some- 

 times smooth, sometimes with minute serrations near tip of maxil- 

 lary tomium; mandible with a distinct longitudinal median groove

or sulcus. Nasal operculum moderately broad and convex, unfeath- 

 ered, but mostly concealed by overhanging frontal feathers, which 

 extend anteriorly beyond anterior end of nostrils, forming a more or 

 less prominent point or antia on each side of the mesorhinium. 

 Tarsus clothed with short feathers; middle and inner toes about equal 

 in length, the outer slightly shorter, the hallux shorter than outer 

 toe; feet relatively very small. Wing more than three times (some- 

 times four times) as long as exposed culmen, the outermost primary 

 longest. Tail nearly to quite two-thirds as long as wing, emarginate, 

 the rectrices broad, with broadly rounded tip. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green or (in one species only) grayish 

 brown or olive, the tail metallic green or blue, or (in C. delpMnse) 

 olive, crossed by a subterminal band of darker green, blue, blackish, 

 or bronze-dusky; a conspicuous post-auricular tuft of violet, violet- 

 blue, or (in C. serrirostris) violet-red broad, rounded and imbricated 

 feathers; under parts mostly metallic green, this broken by darker 

 centers to the strongly individualized feathers (producing an effect 

 quite peculiar to the genus), sometimes relieved by a violet or violet- 

 blue pectoral or jugular area, the chin and suborbital region also 

 sometimes violet or violet-blue; in C. delphinse the under parts brown- 

 ish (more or less spotted or mottled), the throat with metallic green, 

 bluish, or bronzy feathers, the tail-coverts broadly margined with 

 light cinnamon. Sexes alike in coloration, but females usually 

 decidedly smaller than males. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Guiana, southern Brazil, Bolivia, and 

 Peru. (Nine species.)

COLIBRI CYANOTUS (Bourcier and Myiarchuslsaat). 



LESSER VIOLET-EAR, 



Similar to C. thalassinus, but without blue on chest or lores. 



Adult male. — Above metallic green or bronze-green; tail more 

 bluish green (the middle rectrices usually more bronzy), crossed by 

 a broad subterminal band of blue-black; remiges dark brownish slate 

 or dusky, very faintly glossed with purplish; suborbital and auricular 

 (but not loral) region rich dark metallic violet-blue; chin and throat 

 bright metallic green (varying from slightly bluish to yellowish 

 emerald green) each feather with a darker median streak or spot; 

 rest of under parts duller metallic green, the center of chest sometimes 

 slightly tinged with bluish green; under tail-coverts metallic green 

 or bronze-green, margined (broadly toward base) with pale brownish 

 or grayish buffy; femoral tufts brownish white; bill dull black; iris 

 dark brown; feet grayish brown or dusky; length (skins), 98-118 

 (109) ; wing, 59.5-68.5 (65.2) ; tail, 35-45.5 (40.4) ; culmen, 19.5-23.5 

 (21.2).° 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male, but smaller and slightly 

 duller in color; length (skins), 96-113 (103); wing, 58-68 (62.3); tail, 

 34-43 (38.3); culmen, 16-23 (20.5). a 



Young. — Essentially like adults, but feathers of upper parts con- 

 spicuously tipped or margined with rusty brown or cinnamon, those 

 of under parts similarly but less distinctly margined, the chin and 

 throat dull metallic green (the brilliant feathers of the adult plumage 

 first appearing on center of throat).

I feel quite sure that several of the alleged females from Venezuela are in reality 

 males with the sex wrongly determined . If these were eliminated the average dimen- 

 sions of the female would be considerably reduced. 



Specimens from Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela seem to be quite 

 alike; but those from eastern Ecuad6r (Baeza) are easily distinguished by their 

 conspicuously buffy under tail-coverts and (at least in males) larger size.

lores pale cinnamon or dull whitish; malar region dull white to pale 

 brownish gray or pale brown, forming a more or less conspicuous 

 stripe; suborbital and auricular regions and patch on upper portion 

 of side of neck rich dark metallic violet-blue or bluish violet; general 

 color of under parts dull grayish brown, the feathers usually more 

 or less distinctly edged or margined with paler (forming a somewhat 

 streaked appearance), the throat mostly (sometimes wholly) covered 

 by a patch of metallic green, this often passing at lower extremity 

 into blue or violet-blue; under tail-coverts cinnamon or cinnamon- 

 buff, with a subbasal or central spot of light grayish brown or olive; 

 femoral tufts (inconspicuous) dull white, tinged with cinnamon; bill 

 dull black, the mandible somewhat more brownish, at least basally; 

 iris dark brown; feet dusky grayish brown. 



Young. — Similar to adults, but feathers of back, scapulars, hind- 

 neck and pileum broadly tipped or terminally margined with rusty

» Two specimens. 



I am somewhat doubtful as to the validity of this form, which at present rests on two 

 specimens. In these the color of the throat is distinctly different from that in the 

 only two adult males of true L. amethystinus now before me (from Vera Cruz), being 

 a more decided purple or less pinkish (nearly phlox purple, the color in L. a. ame- 

 thystinus being rather more pinkish than solferino). A specimen from San Crist6bal, 

 Chiapas (provisionally referred to L. a. salvini, though by no means typical of the 

 latter) has the throat colored precisely as in these specimens from western Mexico, 

 while one from Mt. Zempoaltepec, in northeastern Oaxaca, has it colored very much 

 as in true L. amethystinus. Before the geographic variations in this species and the 

 character of relationship between L. amethystinus and the two local Guerrero forms 

 (£. margaritse and L. pringlei) can be satisfactorily understood, a much larger num- 

 ber of specimens must be carefully compared. 



b Two specimens, one of them (from San Crist6bal, Chiapas) not typical.

Genus OREOPYRA Gould. 



Oreopyraa Gould, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1860, 312; Introd. Trochil., 1861, 141. 

 (Type, O. leueaspis Gould = Trockilus ( ?) castaneoventris Gould.) 



Medium-sized Trochilidae (length about 90-110 "mm.) closely related 

 to Lampornis and Cyanolsemus, but with relatively shorter bill, nasal 

 operculum narrower and more concealed, and more feathered tarsi; 

 under parts not gray, and coloration more brilliant, the adult males 

 green, white, or green and white beneath, with pure white, brilliant 

 green, or violet throat-patch, usually with forehead and crown glit- 

 tering green or blue, adult females with under parts light cinnamon- 

 rufous or white. 



Bill about as long as head, moderately slender, straight, terete; 

 culmen rounded except basally, where contracted into a narrow 

 ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with a lateral median groove. Nasal 

 operculum rather narrow, its outer edge straight or but slightly 

 convex basally, mostly hidden by frontal feathering, which extends 

 about as far as anterior end of nostrils, forming a short point or antia 

 on each side of mesorhinium. Tarsus clothed with short feathers, 

 except posterior edge; inner toe very slightly shorter than middle 

 toe, the outer toe still shorter, the hallux about as long as outer toe. 

 Wing more than three times as long as culmen in adult males, about 

 three times as long in females, the outermost primary longest. Tail 

 about three-fifths as long as wing, rather deeply emarginate in adult 

 males, slightly double.-rounded or truncate in females, the rectrices 

 moderately broad, rounded or subcuneate at tip. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green, bronze-green or bronze, the 

 upper tail-coverts sometimes dusky; tail plain gray, blackish passing 

 into gray on lateral rectrices, or dull bronzy with paler tip in adult 

 males (sometimes in females also), bronze-green with blackish tip or 

 subterminal band and pale gray tip to lateral rectrices in females of 

 some species. Adult males usually with forehead and crown glit- 

 tering green or blue, a throat-patch of metallic violet or pure white 

 or else throat spotted with bright metallic green, the remaining under 

 parts mostly white (0. Jiemileuca, O. syoiUx, and O. viridipallens) or 

 metallic green (in other species). Adult females with under parts 

 light cinnamon-rufous, or white (0. Jiemileuca, O. sybillse, and O. 

 viridipaUens).

Range. — Southern Mexico to western Panama, in higher moun-

The proper disposition of Trochilus viridipallens Bourcier and 

 Myiarchuslsant which both Elliot and Hartert place in " Cceligena" (= Cya- 

 nolsemus) — both authors uniting Cceligena and " Delattria" — and its 

 near relative, " Delattria" sybillse Salvin, is a matter of difficulty and 

 uncertainty; but I am convinced that unless a new genus is made for 

 their accomodation they fit far better in Oreopyra than in " Delattria." 

 The only alternative is to consider Oreopyra as also a synonym of 

 ' ' Delattria ' ' = Lampqrnis.

OREOPYRA CASTANEOVENTRIS CALOLffiMA (Salvin). 



COSTA RICAN MOUNTAIN GEM. 



Similar to O. c. castaneoventris, but adult male with, chin and 

 throat always metallic violet or purple, the feathers gray, instead 

 of white, immediately beneath the surface. 6 



Young male. — Upper parts, including tail, as in adult female; 

 chin and throat dusky, the latter with a few tawny-ochraceous 

 feathers along middle line, the dusky color gradually passing into 



o Varying, in different specimens, from royal purple to phlox purple. 



& The supposed difference in coloration of the upper parts in females mentioned 

 by Salvin (Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1870, 205, 206) proves to be inconstant; in fact 

 does not, so far as I am able to see, exist in even a considerable proportion of specimens.

 feathers; anterior toes about equal in length, the hallux slightly 

 shorter, all the toes rather stout, with well- developed and very- 

 acute claws. Wing three times (more or less) as long as exposed 

 culmen, the outermost primary longest. Tail about two-thirds as 

 long as wing, emarginate or slightly double-rounded, the rectrices 

 very broad, rather soft. 



Coloration. — Pileum brilliant metallic blue, violet-blue or violet 

 bordered posteriorly by velvety black; back, etc., metallic green, 

 passing into blue on upper tail-coverts; tail uniform blue-black or 

 violet-black; under parts mostly brilliant metallic green but this 

 relieved by a violet jugular area and brilliant golden orange or scarlet 

 on throat. Sexes alike. 



Range. — High mountains of Costa Rica and western Panama.

PANTERPE INSIGNIS Cabanis and Heine. 



IRAZtT HUMMING BIRD. 



Adults (sexes alike). a — Forehead and crown bright metallic blue 

 (varying from greenish to a slightly purplish hue), the feathers dusky 

 gray basally with a bar of velvety black (concealed) between the gray 

 basal portion and the metallic blue tip; loral and supra-auricular 

 regions, occiput, and nape velvety black (a) changing to bronze or 

 dull coppery bronze in position c; back, scapulars, and wing-coverts 



° After careful examination of a very large series of specimens I can not find that 

 there is even an average difference of coloration between the sexes, some of the most 

 brightly colored specimens being females, while some of the dullest are males.

Kather small Trochilidae (length about 80-90 mm.) related to 

 Agyrtria, but differing in broader median and relatively narrower 

 lateral rectrices, narrower and relatively longer bill, and more varied 

 coloration; adult males with pileum brilliant emerald green and 

 throat bright metallic violet-blue; adult female essentially similar 

 but much duller, with no blue on throat or at most with merely 

 spots of that color, pileum less brilliantly green, and rectrices tipped 

 with gray. 



Bill nearly half as long as wing, straight, narrow (terete), not dis- 

 tinctly if at all widened basally, the culmen broadly rounded except 

 mesorhinal portion, where narrowly ridged; tomia smooth; median 

 lateral sulci of maxilla and mandible fairly distinct. Nostril narrow, 

 slit-like, overhung by a rather narrow, partly (sometimes mostly) 

 feathered operculum. Tarsus completely covered with short feathers ; 

 middle and inner toes equal in length, the outer decidedly shorter; 

 hallux decidedly shorter than outer toe; toes small, but claws rela- 

 tively large. Wing more than twice as long as exposed culmen, the 

 outermost primary longest. Tail more than half as long as wing, 

 slightly to decidedly rounded, the middle rectrices rather broad, the

 decided bronze hue on upper tail-coverts and middle rectrices; rec- 

 trices (except middle pair) bronze or greenish bronze basally and dull 

 blackish or dusky terminally, the dusky decreasing in extent from the 

 outermost rectrix, on which it occupies approximately the terminal 

 half, to the fourth, on which it is confined to the tip ; remiges dusky 

 or dull brownish slate, very faintly glossed with bluish, the primary 

 coverts similar but slightly darker and sometimes faintly glossed with 

 green terminally; chin, throat, and chest brilliant metallic emerald 

 green, the feathers pure white beneath surface, this more or less 

 exposed, especially on upper throat; sides more bronzy green, tbe 

 feathers grayish white or pale gray basally; rest of under parts 

 white, the breast, at least laterally, more or less spotted with metallic 

 green; maxilla dull black; mandible pale (flesh colored in life), dusky 

 terminally; iris dark brown; legs and feet dusky; length (skins), 

 93-99(95); wing, 52-55 (53.9); tail, 31-35 (32.4); culmen, 19-19.5 

 (19.3).* 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male, but chin, throat, and 

 chest white, the throat usually sparsely spotted with dull metallic 

 emerald green; under parts of body more extensively white; lateral 

 rectrices extensively but indistinctly tipped with pale brownish gray; 

 length (skins), 90-96 (94) ; wing, 50.5-55 (52.8) ; tail, 30-32.5 (31.6) ;

Genus RICCORDIA Reiehenbaeh. 



[Chlorestes.] 8. Riccordia Reichenbach, Aufz. der Colib., Myiarchusrch?, 1854, 8. (Type, 

 Riccordia ramondii Reicbenbach= Trochilus ricordii Gervais.) 



Ricordia (emendation) Simon, Cat. Troch., 1897, 18. 



Sporadinus Bonaparte, Rev. et Myiarchusg. de Zool., vi, Myiarchusy, 1854, 255. (Type, aa 

 fixed by Gray, 1855, Trochilus ricordii Gervais.) 



Sporadicus (emendation, on grounds of purism) Cabanis and Heine, Myiarchuss. Hein., 

 iii, Myiarchusrch, 1860, 25. 



Small Trochilidse (length about 95-105 mm.) resembling the longer 

 tailed species of GhlorostiTbon, but with lateral rectrices relatively 

 much wider. 



Bill about as long as head, straight, slightly depressed; culmen 

 broadly rounded, but basally contracted into a more or less distinct 

 narrow ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with a distinct median lateral 

 groove, the maxilla with a faint indication of a similar one. Nasal 

 operculum broad and convex posteriorly, feathered on upper posterior 

 portion, the frontal feathering forming two obtuse antise which extend 

 about as far as middle of nasal operculum. Tarsus clothed with short 

 feathers; lateral toes about equal, slightly shorter than middle toe, 

 the hallux shorter than lateral toes. Wing more than three times as 

 long as exposed culmen (slightly less in females), the outer primary 

 longest. Tail nearly as long as wing in adult males, about three- 

 fourths as long in females, deeply forked, the lateral rectrices broad, 

 all rounded at tip. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green or bronze-green; adult males 

 with under parts bright metallic green (one species with a velvety 

 black jugular spot), the tail black with middle rectrices more or less 

 bronzy; adult females with under parts brownish gray, the tail much 

 as in adult males. 



Range. — Bahama Islands, Cuba, and Haiti. (Two species.) 



This genus is very close to GhlorostiTbon, and differs mainly, if not 

 solely, in the relatively broader lateral rectrices, the form of the tail 

 being very similar to that of some species of Thalurania. As stated 

 under GhlorostiTbon, it has been found necessary to transfer from this 

 genus to the latter R. maugsei, of Porto Rico, in order that it may be 

 possible to characterize the two groups. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OP RICCORDIA. 



u. Under parts mostly metallic green. (Adult males.) 

 b. No black on under parts. (Riccordia ricordii.) 

 c. Tail averaging longer and relatively more deeply forked (average length 43.9, 

 average depth of fork 23.2); rectrices less distinctly bronzy. (Cuba, includ- 

 ing Isle of Pines.) Riccordia ricordii ricordii, adult male (p. 543). 



cc. Tail averaging shorter and relatively less deeply forked (average length 41.6, 

 average depth of fork 19); rectrices more distinctly bronzy. (Bahamas.)

RICCORDIA RICORDII RICORDH (Gervais). 



BJCORD'S EMERALD. 



Adult male. — Above rather dark metallic bronze-green, darker and 

 decidedly duller on pileum; four middle rectrices dark metallic bronze 

 or greenish bronze, the next pair similar but with inner webs greenish 

 black; two outer pairs of rectrices greenish black, or black faintly 

 glossed with bluish green or greenish blue, the outer web of next to 

 outer pair slightly bronzed; remiges dark brownish slate or dusky, 

 faintly glossed with violaceous; under parts brilliant metallic green 

 (yellowish emerald green) ; femoral tufts and under tail-coverts white, 

 the latter sometimes with a few small spots or streaks of grayish on 

 lateral feathers; maxilla dull black; mandible brownish (pinkish or

Small Trochilidse (length about 70-100 mm/) with straight, narrow 

 bill about as long as head, tail more or less forked or emarginate 

 (rarely nearly truncate or slightly double-rounded in female), with 

 lateral rectrices decidedly narrower than middle pair, the adult males 

 with under parts wholly brilliant metallic green and tail (except in 

 species of "Panychlora" group) blue-black, the middle rectrices 

 sometimes tipped with gray; adult females gray beneath, lateral 

 rectrices green or grayish basally, blue-black terminally or subtermi- 

 nally, the outermost (at least) tipped with pale gray. 



Bill slender, straight, nearly terete, about as long as head; culmen 

 broadly rounded but basally contracted into a more or less distinct

ridge; tomia smooth; maxilla and mandible (especially the latter) 

 each with a more or less distinct median lateral groove. Nasal 

 operculum broad and convex posteriorly, the upper basal portion 

 feathered; frontal feathering forming two narrow antiae, extending 

 nearly (sometimes quite) as far forward as anterior end of nasal 

 operculum. Tarsus clothed with short feathers; lateral toes about 

 as long as middle toe, the hallux shorter. Wing three to nearly four 

 times as long as culmen, the outer primary longest. Tail less than 

 half as long as wing to nearly as long as wing in adult males of some 

 species, emarginate or forked in adult males, forked, emarginate, or 

 slightly double-rounded in females, the rectrices straight, the outer 

 ones narrower than middle pair, sometimes much narrower, but 

 always with rounded tip. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green or bronze-green. Adult males 

 brilliant metallic green below, the tail blue-black, green, bronze, or 

 copper-bronze, sometimes with middle rectrices tipped with gray. 

 Females with under parts pale gray or grayish white, middle rectrices 

 greenish (usually blackish terminally or subterminally) , the lateral 

 rectrices greenish or gray basally, black terminally or subterminally, 

 the outermost tipped with pale grayish. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Cayenne, Paraguay, northern Argen- 

 tina, Bolivia, and Peru; one species in Porto Rico. (About twenty- 

 one species, including subspecies.) 



For the present, I follow von Berlepsch and Hartert in uniting 

 PanycMora Cabanis and Heine with this genus. Panychlora seems at 

 first examination to be a very well circumscribed group, the males 

 of all the species having brightly metallic (never blue-black) rectrices, 

 and the tail relatively shorter than in most species of (Jhlorostilbon 

 (not more than half as long as wing) ; but C. prasinus has the tail 

 even shorter (decidedly less than half as long as wing). In short, 

 when all the species of the two groups are carefully compared it 

 is found that there is no character, apparently, that will serve to 

 separate them. 



If Riccordia is to be kept separate from (Jhhrostiloon, as I believe it 

 should, it is necessary to remove R. maug&i from the former and 

 transfer it to the present genus.

 Heliotrix (emendation) Bonaparte, Consp. Av., i, 1850, 69. 



Rather large Trochilidse (length about 100-120 mm.) with the 

 straight bill excessively compressed (finely wedge-shaped) anteriorly, 

 tail more or less graduated (but rectrices broadly rounded terminally), 

 under parts white, and with a black stripe on side of head. 



Bill (unfeathered portion) about as long as head, straight, rather 

 broad and depressed basally, excessively compressed terminally, 

 narrowly cuneate with finely acuminate tip, in vertical profile; cul- 

 men distinctly ridged throughout (but less sharply so posteriorly); 

 tomia smooth; mandible with a longitudinal, median narrow groove 

 on basal half only. Nasal operculum very narrow, completely hidden 

 by the dense, closely appressed frontal feathering, which extends to 

 or beyond anterior end of the nostrils, forming a short obtuse point 

 or antia on each side of culmen or these merged into a single, broader, 

 median antia. Feet excessively small; tarsus feathered on upper 

 portion, except on inner side; lateral toes about equal in length, 

 slightly shorter than middle toe; hallux much shorter than lateral 

 toes. Wing about four times as long as exposed culmen, the outer- 

 most primary longest. Tail about three-fifths as long as wing in adult 

 males to five-sixths as long in adult females, graduated, the rectrices 

 rather soft, with broadly rounded tip. 



Coloration. — Metallic grass-green or bronze-green above, the middle 

 rectrices bluish black, lateral rectrices and under parts pure white 

 (faintly spotted with grayish on chest in young) ; a black loral, sub- 

 orbital and auricular stripe. Adult males with a stripe of brilliant 

 metallic emerald green beneath the black stripe on side of head, a 

 violet post-auricular tuft, sometimes with the pileum metallic violet. 



Range. — Guatemala to Guiana and Peru. (Three species.)

HELIOTHRYX BARROTI (Bourcier and Myiarchuslsant). 



BARROT'S FAIRY. 



Adult male. — Forehead and crown bright metallic violet or blue- 

 violet ("royal purple"); loral, suborbital, and auricular regions 

 opaque velvety black, the last terminated by a spot or short tuft of 

 metallic bluish violet; a band extending from malar apex to side of 

 neck, immediately beneath the black loral-suborbital-auricular 

 stripe, very brilliant metallic emerald green; occiput, hindneck, back, 

 scapulars, wing-coverts, rump, and upper tail-coverts uniform soft 

 metallic green; four middle rectrices slightly glossy blue-black; 

 remaining rectrices pure white; under parts, from chin to under tail- 

 coverts, inclusive, immaculate pure white; bill black; feet light 

 brownish (in dried skins); length (skins), 94-121 (108); wing, 63-69 

 (65.9); tail, 35.5-54.5 (45.4); culmen, 15-18 (16.7).° 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male, but forehead and crown 

 green, like rest of upper parts, white of under parts extending up to 

 the black loral-suborbital-auricular stripe, and violet post-auricular 

 spot wanting; chest sometimes (in younger individuals) spotted or 

 streaked with brownish gray; tail averaging much longer; length 

 (skins), 117-134 (124); wing, 63-70.5 (66.6); tail, 43-73 (60.9); cul- 

 men, 15.5-19 (17.1). 6

I am unable to subtantiate the claims of a subspecies, H. b. alincins, for Guatemala 

 to Costa Rica, as proposed by Myiarchus. Oberholser, since the characters ascribed do not 

 hold good. It is possible the bird from western Ecuad6r should be separated on 

 account of its much shorter tail, usually more bluish violet crown, and apparently 

 broader subauricular green stripe; but a much larger series is necessary to determine 

 the question. 



The individual variation in length of tail is very great, especially among females.

Genus FLORISUGA Bonaparte. 



Florisuga Bonaparte, Conep. Av., i, 1850, 73. (Type, Trochilus mellivorus 

 Linnaeus.) 



Kather large Trochilidee (length about 95-110 mm.) with appar- 

 ently twelve rectrices (the longer upper tail-coverts so elongated 

 and specialized as to simulate the middle rectrices), tail equal to or 

 longer than combined length of head and bill, emarginate, with 

 rectrices broad, firm, and (at least in adult male) nearly truncated 

 at tip, tarsi densely clothed with rather long feathers (especially 

 behind), and abdomen white. 



Bill a little longer than head, rather stout, straight, nearly terete; 

 culmen rounded except basally, where narrowly ridged; tomia 

 smooth; maxilla and mandible each with a rather indistinct narrow 

 median lateral groove. Nostril narrow, slit-like, overhung by a 

 broad, tumid, almost wholly feathered operculum, only the edge of 

 which is exposed. Tarsus wholly feathered, the feathering long on 

 posterior portion; middle and inner toes about equal in length, the 

 outer toe slightly shorter; hallux slightly shorter than outer toe; 

 all the toes small and weak, with claws relatively small. Wing about 

 four times as long as exposed culmen, the outermost primary longest. 

 Tail a little more than half (female) as long as wing to nearly three- 

 fifths as long (adult male), emarginate, the rectrices firm, very 

 broad, broadly rounded or (in adult male) nearly truncated at tip; 

 the rectrices apparently 12 in number (at least in adult male) through 

 specialization of the two longest upper coverts, which are as long as 

 and differently colored from the middle rectrices. 



Coloration. — Adult male with head and neck metallic violet-blue, 

 back, scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts metallic green; breast, 

 abdomen, flanks, under tail-coverts, and tail (including middle 

 rectrices) white, the latter narrowly tipped with black; a white fine 

 across hindneck. Adult female and young with throat; chest, sides, 

 and under tail-coverts dusky squamated with grayish white, pileum 

 green, like back, etc., and tail dark metallic green crossed at or near 




576 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



tip by a rather broad band of bluish black (the lateral rectrix mainly 

 the latter color), and (in unworn plumage) with a narrow terminal 

 margin of white. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Amazon Valley. (Monotypic.) 



FLORISUGA MELLIVORA (Linnasus). 



JACOBIN HUMMING BIRD. 



Adult male. — Head, neck, and chest uniform dark metallic blue or 

 violet-blue, becoming more greenish blue on hindneck and (some- 

 times) on lower portion of chest; a pure white bar or crescent across 

 lower part of hindneck or extreme upper back, this sometimes 

 obsolete (concealed) ; a back, scapulars, wing-coverts, rump, and upper 

 tail-coverts metallic green, bronze-green, or bronze; tail white, the 

 rectrices narrowly tipped (or terminally margined) and usually edged 

 (more or less) with black; 6 remiges slate-blackish, faintly glossed with 

 violaceous; breast, abdomen, flanks, and under tail-coverts immacu- 

 late pure white; sides metallic green, bronze-green, or bronze, this 

 color invading sides of breast, where sometimes extending entirely 

 across the upper portion; bill dull black; iris dark brown; feet 

 dusky; length (skins), 95-124 (118); wing, 62-71.5 (68.4); tail, 

 32-43 (38.1); culmen, 16.5-22 (19.3). c 



Adult female. — Above metallic bronze-green or greenish bronze, 

 slightly duller or darker on pileum; tail usually more bluish green 

 (sometimes decidedly bluish), the rectrices broadly blackish sub- 

 terminally and tipped or terminally margined with white, this 

 broad and conspicuous on outermost pair but reduced to a narrow 

 edging on middle pair, the outer web of outer pair broadly edged 

 with grayish white or pale gray basally; remiges slate-blackish or 

 dusky slate, faintly glossed with violaceous; chin white (at least in 

 part) ; throat and chest with feathers dusky centrally, broadly mar- 

 gined with white (producing a scaled effect), the dark central spots 

 usually more or less glossed with metallic green or bluish green, 

 especially on chest; sides of breast and sides mottled or squamated 

 with white and bronze or bronze-greenish; median portion of breast, 

 abdomen, and flanks immaculate white; under tail-coverts dusky 

 grayish glossed with bronze-greenish basally, slightly glossy blue- 

 black subterminally, and tipped or terminally margined (broadly) 



a This white marking varieB greatly in development, even in specimens from the 

 same locality; sometimes it is entirely concealed, the tips of the feathers being 

 metallic green; again it is broad and conspicuous. The "make" of the skin has 

 much to do with its apparent development, since specimens with the head crowded 

 close to the body have the white mark entirely covered or obliterated. 



& The middle rectrices, which are white, black-tipped, like the rest, are almost 

 wholly covered and hidden by the elongated upper tail-coverts.

Immature male. — Essentially like adult male but coloration duller; 

 middle rectrices with only basal portion white, the terminal half or 

 more being dusky dull metallic greenish or bronzy broadly tipped 

 with black; rictal region (more or less extensively) light buffy 

 brown or cinnamon. 6

Very small Trochilidse (length about 60-70 mm.) with the straight 

 bill shorter than head, wing about four times as long as exposed cul- 

 men, tail less than half as long as wing, with rectrices (except middle 

 pair) white basally, the adult males with general color plain dark 

 metallic purplish relieved by a pure white pileum. 



Bill shorter than head, straight, rather slender, terete or slightly 

 compressed; culmen rounded except basally, where contracted into 

 a narrow ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with the usual lateral 

 median groove. Nasal operculum narrow, completely hidden by the 

 appressed frontal feathering, which extends forward considerably 

 beyond anterior end of nostrils, forming a single broad, rounded, or 

 truncate antia on base of culmen. Tarsus feathered, except on inner 

 side; inner and middle toes about equal in length, the outer very 

 slightly shorter. Wing about four times as long as exposed culmen, 

 the outermost primary longest, normal in shape. Tail a little less 

 than half as long as wing, slightly double-rounded, the rectrices 

 broadly rounded at tip. 



Coloration. — Adult males with whole pileum satiny white; rest of 

 plumage dark metallic blackish purple or coppery purple, the chin 

 and throat bronzy blackish (whole under parts, except under tail- 

 coverts, blackish in one species), the under tail-coverts and basal por- 

 rtion of tail (except middle rectrices) white; adult females metallic 

 bronze-green above, including pileum, the middle rectrices more

Nat. Ois.-Mouch., iv, 1877, 87. (Type, Trochilus calliope Gould.) 



Small Trochilidae (length about 65-75 mm.) resembling Atihis but 

 differing in longer tenth primary, relatively shorter and differently 

 shaped and differently colored tail, with subspatulate middle rectrices 

 (in both sexes), and in the very narrow and much elongated throat 

 ("gorget") feathers of the adult male. 



Bill about as long as head or slightly longer, slender, straight, nearly 

 terete; culmen rounded but at extreme base contracted into a rather 

 distinct ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with the usual lateral median 

 groove or sulcus. Nasal operculum covered by the appressed frontal 

 feathering, which anteriorly extends considerably beyond nostrils, 

 forming a very short obtuse point or antia on each side of culmen.

Tarsus feathered, except on posterior side; lateral toes about equal 

 in length, slightly shorter than middle toe. Wing about three times 

 as long as exposed culmen, the outermost primary longest, not atten- 

 uated at tip. Tail about half as long as wing, double-rounded, the 

 rectrices broadest subterminally, subspatulate (especially the middle 

 pair) in adult male, in adult female rounded, with rectrices less dis- 

 tinctly subspatulate. 



Coloration. — Above metallic bronze-green; beneath dull whitish 

 medially and on chest, cinnamon-buff y laterally; adult male with nar- 

 row, elongated feathers of throat pure white basally, metallic reddish 

 purple terminally, the tail (including middle rectrices) blackish passing 

 into sooty grayish terminally and edged with cinnamon-rufous 

 basally; adult female with throat whitish, sometimes flecked with 

 dusky, middle rectrices bronze-greenish, other rectrices grayish 

 basally (with shaft of that portion pale cinnamon) black subterminally 

 or terminally, the two or three outermost tipped with white.

 brownish gray; remaining rectrices similar in coloration, but cinna- 

 momeous basal edgings less distinct (sometimes obsolete) and grayish 

 tip less distinct; remiges dull brownish slate or dusky, very faintly 

 glossed with purplish; feathers of gorget narrow and distinctly out- 

 lined, much elongated posteriorly, pure white basally and metallic 

 reddish purple (solferino) terminally, the basal white much exposed, 

 especially on chin and upper throat; foreneck and chest white, or 

 grayish white; rest of under parts more grayish, strongly tinged or 

 suffused with cinnamon-buff laterally, the sides glossed, or overlaid,

 rather more strongly individualized and relatively longer, especially 

 the lateral ones. 



Bill about as long as head or slightly shorter, slender, straight, 

 nearly terete; culmen rounded, slightly contracted or indistinctly 

 ridged at extreme base; tomia smooth; mandible with the usual 

 lateral median groove. Nasal operculum hidden by appressed frontal 

 feathering, which anteriorly extends beyond nostrils, forming a very 

 short obtuse point or antia on each side of culmen. Tarsus feathered, 

 except along posterior side; outer toe slightly shorter than middle 

 toe, the inner toe decidedly shorter, hallux (apparently) shorter than 

 outer toe. Wing about three times as long as exposed culmen, the 

 outermost primary, or two outermost, longest, the outermost nar-

 from the cinnamon-rufous by a space of bronze-green or greenish 

 bronze; other rectrices with basal half or more cinnamon-rufous, the 

 subterminal portion (extensively) black (usually with more or less 

 of bronze-green or greenish bronze between the black and the cin- 

 namon-rufous portion), the tip (broadly) white; remiges brownish 

 slate color or dusky, very faintly glossed with violaceous; sides of 

 head brownish gray or grayish brown, passing into dull white on 

 anterior portion of malar region and on postocular region; chin and

Small Trochihdse (length about 65-85 mm.), related to ArcMlochus 

 and Oalypte, but differing from both in having the tail more or less 

 rounded or graduated in adult males, strongly rounded in adult 

 females and young; adult males also differing from those of ArcMlo- 

 chus in having the "gorget" elongated laterally, and from those of 

 Calypte in having the pileum concolor with the back; adult males of 

 most species with outermost primary attenuated and acute terminally. 



Bill about as long as head to decidedly longer, straight, slender, 

 terete; culmen rounded except basaUy, where contracted into a more 

 or less distinct ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with the usual lateral 

 median groove or sulcus. Nasal operculum rather broad and con- 

 vex, tumid posteriorly, nude, but hidden by appressed frontal feath- 

 ering, which anteriorly extends considerably beyond anterior edge of 

 nostrils, forming a short obtuse point or antia on each side of culmen. 

 Tarsus feathered, except on posterior side; lateral toe slightly 

 shorter than middle toe, but (apparently) slightly longer than hallux. 

 Wing about three times as long as exposed ■ culmen, the outermost 



a One specimen (the type).

primary or two outermost longest, and in adult males usually ° 

 attenuated and accuminate terminally (in S. platycercus slightly 

 excurved, in other species strongly incurved). Tail of adult male 

 about two-thirds as long as wing, more or less rounded or graduated 

 (nearly truncate in S. platycercus), the rectrices more or less con- 

 tracted and obtusely pointed terminally, the lateral ones sometimes 

 very narrow; in adult females and young a little less than three- 

 fifths to two-thirds as long as wing, rounded, the rectrices broader 

 and rounded terminally. 



Coloration. — Above metallic bronze-green or bronze, or else (in 

 S. rufus) mostly cinnamon-rufous; chest white or whitish. Adult 

 males with chin and throat metallic scarlet, rose red, wine purple, 

 or heliotrope, the "gorget" elongated laterally; rectrices mostly 

 dusky, edged, more or less broadly (at least on one web), with 

 cinnamon-rufous, or else cinnamon-rufous with a mesial streak (at 

 least near end) of dusky. Adult females and young with throat 

 whitish, usually flecked with bronze or dusky, sometimes spotted with 

 metallic red, etc., the lateral rectrices cinnamon-rufous basally and 

 broadly tipped with white, cinnamon-buff, or cinnamon-rufous. 



Range. — Southern Alaska to western Panama. (Eight species. 6 )

 outer web broadly edged for most of its length with cinnamon-rufous ; 

 outermost rectrix very broadly tipped with white (the white some- 

 times tinged with cinnamon-rufous or buffy), the sub terminal portion 

 (extensively) black, passing into grayish brown basally, the basal 

 portion of shaft usually rufescent; second rectrix (from outside)

6 Five specimens. 



c It is not absolutely certain that the females on which this description is based 

 are of this species. They agree, however, with Salvin's description, and certainly 

 are different in the coloration of the tail from an equal number of undoubted females 

 of S. flammula.

SELASPHORUS ALLENI Henshaw. 



ALLEN'S a HUMMING BIRD. 



Similar to S. rufus, but smaller and with rectrices much narrower 

 (the outermost much less than 2.5 wide in adult male, not more than 

 2.5 wide in adult female) ; adult male with upper parts (except upper 

 tail-coverts and tail) metallic bronze-green (instead of cinnamon- 

 rufous), and rectrices next to middle pair tapering gradually, without 

 notch or sinuation near tip. 



Adult male. — Above metallic bronze-green, the feathers of rump 

 with basal portion (mostly concealed) deep cinnamon-rufous; upper 



a Named for Charles A. Allen, of Nicasio, California, who first called attention to the 

 specific distinctness of this species from S. rufus.

o Description from no. 2620, coll. Walter E. Bryant, from San Francisco, California. 

 This specimen agrees exactly with Myiarchus. Gould's description and colored figures except 

 in some minor and unessential points, and since Myiarchus. Gould's description and figures, 

 though from the same specimen, do not agree with one another, it is altogether likely 

 that neither is quite correct. Myiarchus. Gould describes the color of the middle pair 

 of rectrices as "green with purple reflexions," and the lateral ones as having the 

 outer webs "purple" and the "inner webs deep reddish buff," but they are not so 

 colored in the plate, which represents the middle pair as green with a continuous 

 broad border of rufous, and the outer pair as uniform purplish dusky, the interme- 

 diate rectrices being rufous with a narrow median stripe of purplish dusky, expanding 

 into a wedge-shaped space near the tip. The coloration of the tail as represented 

 in the plate agrees very well with that of the San Francisco specimen, except that 

 the latter has the basal half of the inner web of the outermost rectrix rufous, and 

 lacks the rufous border around the end of the middle rectrices the rufous running 

 out to the edge a little past the middle of the feather, and thus confined to a little 

 more than the basal half. 



b It is possible that the specimen (Gould's type) in reality came from California, 

 since Floresi collected there as well as in Mexico.

Bill as long as or longer than head, rather slender, straight, terete; 

 culmen rounded except at base where contracted into a narrow ridge; 

 tomia smooth; mandible with the usual lateral median groove. 

 Nasal operculum moderately broad and convex, mostly (sometimes 

 wholly) covered by the appressed frontal feathering, which anteriorly 

 extends to beyond anterior end of nostrils, forming a short angle or 

 antia on each side of culmen. Wing a little more than twice to nearly 

 two and a half times as long as exposed culmen; outermost primary 

 longest, strongly incurved terminally, in adult male of A. colubris 

 much narrower than the next and obtusely pointed terminally; six 

 innermost (proximal) primaries abruptly, and in adult males con-

Genus NESOPHLOX Ridgway. 



Netophloz <* Ridgway, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xxiii, April 19, 1910, 55. (Type, 



Trochilus evelynx Bourcier.) 

 Egolia (not of Erichson, 1842) Mtjlsant and Verreattx, Mem. Soc. Imp. 



Sci. Nat. de Cherbourg, xii, (ser. 2, tome ii), 1866, 230, in text (Classif. 



Troch., 1866, 86). (Type, Trochilus evelynx Bourcier.) 



Small Trochilidse (length about 75-90 mm.) resembling Doricha, 

 but differing in relatively much shorter and nearly to quite straight 

 bill (exposed culmen less than half as long as wing), and tail of adult 

 male shorter than wing. 



Bill about as long as head or slightly longer, straight or at most 

 very faintly decurved, terete; culmen rounded except basally, where

more contracted, sometimes forming a rather distinct narrow ridge; 

 tomia smooth; mandible with the usual longitudinal median sulcus. 

 Nasal operculum rather broad and convex, more or less (sometimes 

 wholly) hidden by the decumbent frontal feathering, which extends 

 forward to beyond anterior end of nostril, forming a short and obtuse 

 point or antia on each side of culmen. Tarsus feathered for upper 

 portion except behind; inner toe about as long as middle toe, the 

 outer very slightly shorter, the hallux shorter than outer toe. Wing 

 more than twice as long as exposed culmen, the outermost primary 

 longest, rather narrow, but not attenuated nor acuminate. Tail in 

 adult male shorter than wing, forked for more than half its length, 

 the lateral rectrices rather narrow but rounded at tip ; in adult females 

 at least half as long as wing, strongly double rounded or rounded 

 with middle pair of rectrices abruptly shorter than the rest. 



Coloration. — Above rather dull or dark metallic bronze or bronze- 

 green, including middle rectrices; under parts of body more or less 

 rufescent, sometimes glossed with green or bronze laterally, the chest 

 whitish or buffy. Adult male with chin and throat bright metallic 

 reddish purple sometimes passing into violet or blue posteriorly, the 

 lateral rectrices purplish black broadly edged on inner web with 

 cinnamon-rufous; adult females with chin and throat dull white or 

 cinnamon-buffy, lateral rectrices rufescent with a subterminal band 

 of black. 



Range. — Bahama Islands ; Costa Rica and western Panama. (Three 

 species.) 



While acknowledging the very close relationship of this group to 

 CattipMox Boie, I believe it is better to keep it apart, the type of 

 CaUipJihx having the lateral rectrices contracted and obtusely pointed 

 terminally, the middle rectrices much broader, and the primaries 

 very much narrower, the outer one very narrow terminally. The 

 coloration is very similar, but in CaUipJihx there is no rufous on the 

 tail, which (except the middle rectrices) is uniform purplish black. 

 N. hryantx is intermediate in coloration between the typical species 

 of the present genus and Calliphlox, the female agreeing with that of 

 the latter in the conspicuous dusky auricular area, while both sexes 

 agree with the species of NesopMox in coloration of the tail. It is 

 also, to a certain extent, intermediate in form, but seems nearer the 

 present group. 



KEY TO 'THE SPECIES OF NESOPHLOX. 



a. Throat bright metallic reddish purple; tail deeply forked, the longer rectrices 



edged on inner -web with cinnamon-rufous but not tipped with that color. (Adult 



wales.)

 basal portion of inner web also) mostly cinnamon-rufous; 6 a small 

 postocular spot (sometimes a rictal spot also) of dull white ; chin and 

 throat brilliant metallic solferino purple passing into violet or violet-

Bill decidedly to very much longer than head, slender, more or less 

 decurved, terete; culmen rounded except basally, where contracted 

 into a rather distinct ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with a distinct 

 longitudinal median narrow groove. Nasal operculum broad and 

 convex but covered by the appressed frontal feathering, which extends 

 forward to beyond anterior end of nostrils, forming a short point or 

 antia on each side of culmen. Tarsus feathered except on posterior 

 side and extreme lower portion; lateral toes about equal in length,

 toes. Wing relatively small, less than twice as long as exposed cul- 

 men in adult males, about twice as long in females, the outermost 

 primary longest and distinctly narrowed and incurved terminally in 

 adult males. Tail about three-fourths as long as wing in adult males, 

 rather deeply forked but with outermost rectrix not longer than next 

 pair, all the longer rectrices narrow (the lateral ones acicular in one 

 species); in adult female tail less than two-thirds as long as wing, 

 rounded or double-rounded, all the rectrices normally broad. 



Coloration. — Above metallic bronze-green, greenish bronze, or 

 bronze, including middle rectrices; under parts mostly whitish 

 medially, greenish, bronzy, or buffy laterally. Adult males with 

 chin and throat brilliantly metallic reddish purple changing to violet 

 or even blue (the posterior-lateral feathers of the "gorget" much 

 elongated), the chest dull white, the lateral rectrices wholly blackish; 

 adult female with throat and chest buffy or whitish, and lateral rec- 

 trices cinnamon-rufous basally, then blackish, the two or three 

 outermost pairs tipped with white. 



Range. — Mountains of Mexico, including adjacent parts of Texas, 

 New Mexico, and Arizona. (Two species.) 



KEY TO THE SPECIES OF CALOTHORAX. 



a. Throat brilliant metallic purple; tail deeply forked, the lateral rectrices narrow, 

 pointed, wholly purplish black. {Adult males.) 

 b. Bill longer, the exposed culmen 20-22.5 (21.2), strongly decurved; outermost 

 rectrix very narrow, attenuate-acuminate or acicular terminally. (Whole of 

 Mexico and adjacent portion of United States.)

 lus cristatus Linnaeus.) 



Myiarchuscrolyssa Riley, Auk, xxi, Oct., 1904, 485. (Type Trochilus exilis Gmelin.) 



Small Trochilidse (length about 73-95 mm.) with basal half (more 

 or less) of maxilla feathered, tarsus naked, tail three-fifths to nearly 

 two-thirds as long as wing, rounded, the adult male with a flat, 

 pointed occipital crest, which, with forehead and crown is brilliant 

 metallic green or else the crest (at least terminally) violet or violet- 

 blue. 



Bill straight, terete, rather slender, longer from rictus than head, 

 but the unfeathered portion much shorter than head, the frontal 

 feathering advancing over base of maxilla to nearly half the distance 

 from rictus to tip of maxilla in adult females, to considerably more 

 in adult males; culmen rounded except basally, where contracted 

 into a more or less distinct ridge; tomia smooth; mandible with the 

 usual lateral median groove very distinct. Nasal operculum nar- 

 row, nude, but wholly concealed by the closely appressed frontal 

 feathering, which extends far anterior to nostrils, forming a distinct 

 point or antia on each side of culmen. Tarsus wholly unfeathered; 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMEBICA. 657 



inner toe about as long as middle toe, the outer slightly shorter. 

 Wing more than four to more than five times as long as exposed 

 culmen, the outermost primary longest, strongly incurved and broadly 

 rounded terminally. Tail three-fifths to nearly two-thirds as long 

 as wing, slightly rounded in adult males, more strongly rounded, 

 with middle rectrices usually shorter than second pair, in adult 

 females, the rectrices rather broad, rounded terminally. 



Coloration. — Adult males with pileum, including occipital crest, 

 brilliant metallic green (the crest more bluish terminally) or the crest 

 metallic blue or violet (at least in part); rest of upper parts rather 

 dark metallic green, the tail purplish black; under parts sooty black- 

 ish, passing into sooty gray on chin and throat. Adult females and 

 young bronze-green above, including middle rectrices, gray beneath; 

 lateral rectrices purplish black, more or less bronzy or greenish basally, 

 tipped with gray. 



Range. — Lesser Antilles; island of Tobago. (Three species, or 

 subspecies.) 



This genus is so evidently closely related to CTirysolampis that it 

 is difficult to understand why they should be so widely separated in 

 most classifications of the group.

BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDLE AMERICA. 667 



trix sometimes (in younger birds ?) with light gray replacing chestnut- 

 rufous, except on part of inner web; remiges dusky, faintly glossed 

 with violaceous; under parts pale brownish gray laterally, whitish 

 medially, the throat usually with a darker median stripe, often inter- 

 mixed with metallic orange or golden feathers; bill, etc., as in adult 

 males; length (skins), 84-96 (92); wing, 51-58 (53.7); tail, 29-35 

 (30.9); exposed culmen, 13-17 (14.8).° 



Immature. — Similar to the adult female, as described above, but 

 without any rufous on tail, the basal half, or more, of rectrices (except 

 middle pair) being brownish gray, faintly glossed with greenish or 

 bronzy, the shaft of that portion being whitish. Immature males to 

 be distinguished by a greater or less number of scattered metallic red 

 feathers on pileum and a median stripe of metallic orange or golden 

 on throat or throat and chest. 



Young. — General color of upper parts cinnamon-rufous, this uni- 

 form on rump, but broken elsewhere by exposed dusky basal portion 

 of feathers, the hindneck glossed with metallic bronze; otherwise like 

 the immature stage, described above, but under parts of body and 

 under tail-coverts suffused with pale cinnamon-rufous and whitish tips 

 to outer rectrices tinged with the same.

Small Trochilidse (length about 65-80 mm.) with nasal operculum 

 very narrow, almost rudimentary, mandibular groove indistinct, a 

 more or less distinct whitish or buffy bar across rump, naked tarsi, 

 tail double-rounded or rounded, with rectrices broadly rounded at tip 

 (three-fifths to about two- thirds as long as wing), the adult males with 




670 



conspicuous crest or neck-tufts or ruffs (sometimes both), and with 

 outer web of ninth primary abruptly narrowed (almost obliterated) 

 terminally. 



Bill shorter than head, stout, nearly terete (broad and depressed 

 basally in L. adordbilis); culmen rounded terminally, narrowly 

 ridged (for a greater or less distance) basally; tomia smooth; man- 

 dible with the usual lateral median groove or sulcus indistinct 

 or obsolete. Nasal operculum narrow, almost rudimentary, hidden 

 by appressed frontal feathering, which anteriorly extends nearly to 

 (sometimes considerably beyond) anterior end of nostrils, forming 

 a single broadly rounded or very faintly emarginate antia on base of 

 culmen. Tarsus naked; lateral toes about equal in length, slightly 

 but distinctly shorter than middle toe. Wing more than three to 

 about four times as long as exposed culmen, the outermost (tenth) 

 primary longest or equal to ninth, narrow but not acuminate, the 

 ninth primary in adult males with outer web abruptly excised or 

 narrowed (almost obliterated) for about terminal third or fourth. 

 Tail in adult male about three-fifths to a little more than two-thirds 

 as long as wing, double-rounded, the outermost rectrices sometimes 

 longer, sometimes shorter, than middle pair — in females and young 

 about half as long as wing, rounded, the rectrices broadly rounded 

 at tip in both sexes. 



Coloration. — Back, etc., metallic green, bronze-green, or bronze; a 

 more or less distinct bar of white or buffy across rump. Adult males 

 extremely variable in coloration of head, neck, and under parts but 

 always with the chin and throat brilliant metallic green; the head 

 often conspicuously crested, and frequently with a conspicuous tuft 

 of elongated, usually spangled or otherwise brilliantly colored feathers 

 springing from the auricular region; adult females without crest or 

 tufts, the chin and throat whitish or buffy, sometimes spotted or 

 flecked with dusky or bronzy. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Cayenne, southern Brazil, Bolivia, 

 and Peru. (About ten species.)

 p. 28); Hist. Nat. Ois.-Mouch., iii, 1876, 235. (Type, Trochilus letitix 

 Bourcier.) 



Mythinia (emendation?) Myiarchuslsant and Vebreaux, Hist. Nat. Ois.-Mouch., iii, 

 1876, 235. 



Small Trochilidse (length, including long tail of adult males, about 

 70-120 mm.) related to Lophornis, but differing in forked tail (in 

 adult male greatly elongated, with lateral rectrices attenuated ter- 

 minally), absence of ornamental head plumes (except a slender, 

 lapwing-like crest in one species), and more uniform coloration. 



Bill (unfeathered portion) shorter than head, straight, nearly terete; 

 culmen rounded except basally, where more or less distinctly ridged; 

 tomia smooth; mandible with the usual lateral median groove. Nasal 

 operculum moderately broad to rather narrow, nude, but hidden by 

 appressed frontal feathering, which anteriorly extends considerably 

 beyond anterior end of nostrils, forming a short, obtuse point or 

 antia on each side of culmen. Tarsus naked; inner toe about as 

 long as middle toe, the outer toe slightly shorter. Wing between 

 three and four times as long as exposed culmen, the outermost (tenth) 

 primary longest, rather narrow but with tip rounded, the ninth with 

 outer web abruptly incised (almost obliterated) for terminal third or 

 fourth, in one species (P. popelairi) entire outer web of both ninth 

 and tenth primaries obsolete. Tail in adult males about one and a 

 half times as long as wing to more than twice as long, forked for 

 much the greater part of its length, the lateral rectrices narrow and 

 attenuated terminally; in adult females about three-fifths as long as 

 wing, forked, but with lateral pair of rectrices shorter than the next. 



Coloration. — Above metallic green or bronze - green, including 

 pileum, the rump crossed by a narrow band or bar of white, this 

 often succeeded by a blackish area. Adult males with chin, throat, 

 and chest metallic green, the remaining under parts mostly green or 

 blackish, or else chin and throat metallic green, chest and middle of 

 breast and abdomen black, sides and flanks sooty; tail with longer 

 rectrices blue-black, violet-black or grayish, the shafts white on 

 under side; one species with a band of metallic orange-reddish, 

 another with a spot of white, on chest. Adult females with under 

 parts mixed black, green, and white, the lateral rectrices tipped with 

 white and grayish basally. 



Range. — Costa Rica to Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. (Five species.) 



It is probable that this genus should be restricted to P. popelairii, 

 which differs from all the others in its very conspicuous, long and 

 slender, lapwing-like crest, almost complete obliteration of outer web 

 of ninth and tenth primaries, more strongly curved primaries, and 

 relatively much shorter wing, the latter only about three times as 

 long as the exposed culmen instead of nearly to quite four times as 




678 BULLETIN 50, UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM. 



long. In case two genera are recognized P. conversi and its allies 

 would constitute a genus the earliest name for which appears to be 

 Gouldomyia Bonaparte (1854).

Adult female. — Upper parts as in adult male, but lower rump and 

 upper tail-coverts darker (mostly purplish black or blackish bronze) ; 

 four middle rectrices bluish black with basal portion of outer web 

 bronze-green, the tip with a very narrow mesial streak of whitish; 

 outermost rectrix with outer web white basally, passing into pale 

 brownish gray distally, crossed by a broad subterminal band of blue- 

 black and broadly tipped (across both webs) with white; second and 

 third rectrices blue-black, with middle portion of outer web greenish 

 or bronzy gray, the second with a distinct, the third with a minute 

 (mesial) white tip; chin and throat opaque black (sometimes inter- 

 mixed with whitish) bordered along each side by a broad white stripe, 

 covering malar region; other under parts mostly black medially (the 

 feathers of chest usually tipped with green), the sides of breast, sides, 

 and flanks mostly metallic green, the space between this and black 

 along middle line of abdomen white; bill, etc., as in adult male; length

Except that they have longer bills, and that the females usually have the subterminal

 different than the latter from Bogota specimens, representing true P. conversii. The

ThiB very well-characterized family of Swifts comprises a single genus (Hemiprocne 

 Nitzsch, Obs. Av. Carot. Com., 1829, 15, type, Cypselus longipennis Temminck; see 

 Oberholser, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xix, 1906, 67, 68), containing about seven species. 

 The nidification of the Dendrochelidonidse is also peculiar, the nest being attached to 

 the upper side of a branch, composed of bits of bark, etc., held together by the bird's 

 saliva, and barely large enough to hold the single egg. They abo perch freely upon 

 branches, while none of the Myiarchuscropodidse do, so far as known. 



6 As distinguished from the Tree Swifts, family Dendrochelidonidse.

as inner toe), directed inward, more or less versatile or capable of 

 being directed forward, the inner toe also more or less versatile, or 

 capable of being directed backward. 



The Swifts are eminently aerial birds and, so far as known, are 

 the only ones among all birds of flight which do not perch upon the 

 branches of trees — a remarkable characteristic when their similarity 

 in general habits in other respects to the Swallow is considered. 

 They cling easily against the side of vertical surfaces, as a rock or 

 the inside of a hollow tree trunk or a chimney, pressing the tail 

 against the surface as an additional support (as in the case of wood- 

 peckers), but apparently they are not able to grasp a branch with 

 their feet in such a way as to maintain a fixed position thereon. 



Like the Swallows (Hirundinidse) the Swifts are insectivorous 

 and take their prey while flying; but their manner of flight is differ- 

 ent, as might be expected from the very different structure of their 

 wings. In this respect, however, there is much difference between 

 different genera, the flight of some being characterized by a velocity 

 perhaps unequaled among other birds, while that of others (as for 

 example the species of Ghsetura) is much less rapid and more flut- 

 tering. 



There are many interesting peculiarities connected with the nidi- 

 fication of Swifts, some of which may be briefly described. In this 

 connection it may be mentioned that the salivary glands are often 

 highly developed, and the glutinous or mucilaginous substance which 

 they secrete enters more or less into the composition of the nest. 

 In the oriental genus CoUocalia (belonging to the subfamily Chae- 

 turinse) the nest is sometimes composed entirely of this substance, 

 and constitutes an important delicacy among Chinese and Japanese 

 epicures. The nest of the common Chimney Swift (Chsetura pelagica) 

 of the eastern United States and related species of the same genus 

 is of similar form to that of the "edible birds' nests" above men- 

 tioned, but is composed of dead twigs glued together by the saliva. 

 The beautiful large black and white swift of Guatemala, Panyptila 

 sancti-hieronymi, attaches to the under side of an overhanging rock 

 a tube some feet in length, constructed of the pappus or seed-down 

 of plants, caught flying in the air. Entrance to this is from the 

 lower end, and the eggs are laid on a kind of shelf near the top. A 

 smaller but otherwise similar species (P. cayanensis) found from 

 Nicaragua southward attaches a similar nest to the under side of 

 a large branch of a forest tree. 5 Chsetura brachyura is said to make 



a The Tree Swifts (Dendrochelidonidse), however, are said to perch upon trees 

 in the manner of Swallows and other birds. 

 b See Richmond, Auk, xv, 1898, 7-10, pi. 1. 




BIRDS OF NORTH AND MIDDI*E AMERICA. 685 



a somewhat similar nest, but with the tube more contracted below, 

 out of seeds of Trixis divaricata, suspends it to a horizontal branch, 

 and covers the outside with feathers; as there is no shelf on the 

 inside, it is believed that the eggs are glued against the side and 

 brooded on by the bird while in an upright position.® 



Owing to the extreme velocity of their flight and the great height 

 at which they usually fly, Swifts are very difficult birds to collect, 

 and consequently comparatively few species of the family are well 

 represented in collections. On this account it is not easy to obtain 

 a correct understanding of their geographic range and variations; 

 consequently our present knowledge is, in the case of many species, 

 imperfect and tentative.

bb. Outer and middle toes inclined outwards, at more or less of an angle with axis 

 of tarsus; feet proportionately much weaker, with tarsus relatively longer. 



a This style of nest is so different from that of the species of Chxtura, whose nidifica- 

 tion is known, that the proper identification of the species is very questionable. 

 At the same time, it may be remarked that the suggested mode of securing the eggs 

 is highly improbable.

Small Myiarchuscropodidse (length about 90-100 mm.) with outer and 

 middle toes inclined outward, inner toe freely reversible, toes naked, 

 and tail forked for much less than half its length, the outermost rec- 

 trices not attenuated terminally. 



Outermost (tenth) primary equal to or shorter than eighth, the 

 ninth longest, the tenth short-acuminate terminally; tail less than 

 half as long as wing, forked for much less than half its length, the 

 lateral rectrices not attenuated terminally; tarsus much longer than 

 anterior toes, rather stout, feathered in front; middle toe very slightly 

 longer than lateral toes, the inner toe freely reversible; toes naked. 

 (Unique among Myiarchusropodinae in character of sternum. ) 



Coloration (of American species). — Above sooty blackish, lighter on 

 head and neck; a white patch on each side of rump; throat and abdo- 

 men dull whitish, rest of under parts sooty. 



Nidification. — Nest placed within a hollow spathe or attached to 

 under side of a frond of a palm tree, composed of feathers and plant- 

 down or other soft vegetable fiber (usually down of the Bombax or 

 silk-cotton tree), firmly glued to its support by salivary secretion, the 

 materials of the inner portion also densely felted together with the 

 same substance.

 webs of primaries paler, especially toward edges, the secondaries 

 narrowly margined terminally with paler; a blackish space imme- 

 diately in front of eye, with a less distinct (sometimes nearly obsolete) 

 dull whitish space immediately beneath it; anterior portion of loral

Genus STREPTOPROCNE Oberholser. 



Streptoproene a Oberholser, Proc. Biol. Soc. Wash., xix, Myiarchusy 1, 1906, 69, in text. 

 (Type, Myiarchusrundo zonaris Shaw.) 



Very large Chaeturine Swifts (wing 180-235 mm.) with the hallux 

 more than half as long as inner toe, tarsus longer than middle toe 

 with claw, lateral toes scarcely shorter than middle toe, shafts of 

 rectrices very rigid and more or less produced terminally, the colora- 

 tion plain blackish or sooty with a white collar, at least across 

 hindneck. 



Nostrils elliptical, nearly parallel, for the greater part (some- 

 times wholly) anterior to the latero-frontal antia; distance from 

 tips of longest secondaries to that of longest primary a little less than 

 two-thirds the total length of wing; tenth (outermost) primary 

 longest; tail about one- third as long as wing, emarginate (S. zonaris) 

 or truncate (S. semicollaris) , the rectrices firm, with very rigid and 

 more or less extruded shafts; tarsus longer than middle toe with 

 claw; middle and outer toes equal in length, the inner toe very 

 slightly shorter; hallux (without claw) more than half as long as 

 inner toe (without claw). 6 



Coloration. — Plain blackish or sooty, the adults with a white 

 collar, at least across hindneck.

& A peculiarity in the myology of Streptoproene is thus described by Dr. F. A. Lucas 

 in The Auk, xvi, 1899, 97: 



It might be supposed that the anatomical possibilities of so small a group as the 

 Swifts had been exhausted, but that this is not the case is shown by an examination 

 of Hemiprocne zonaris, for which I am indebted to Myiarchus. C. B. Taylor, of Jamaica. The 

 cranium is typically cypseline, so are the wing muscles, although the deltoid is small, 

 as in the majority of the true Swifts, there being an apparent tendency to reduction 

 in the number of wing muscles in birds which fly, so to speak, by main strength and 

 in which the humerus is reduced in length. The leg muscles are curious first by the 

 absence of the peroneus longus, a, muscle which runs from the head of the tibia to 

 the upper end of the tarsus in Passeres, and second by the great simplification of the 

 deep plantar tendons. In the Passeres, as we all know, one tendon flexes the first 

 digit of the foot, while another with three branches flexes the three front toes. In 

 the Tree Swifts, Myiarchuscropterygidse, the tendon of the hind toe is attached by a short 

 slip to the branch running to the fourth digit. In the other Swifts so far examined 

 the two main tendons are completely fused for some distance although worked by two 

 muscles. Now in Hemiprocne [i. e., Streptoproene] while the muscle which ordinarily 

 works the front toes, the flexor perforans, is present, it has no separate tendon, but is 

 attached to the muscle of the first digit, flexor longus hallucis, and is diverted to the 

 work of pulling on its tendon, which as usual runs up over the outer side of the belly 

 of the muscle. Below this single tendon sends off four slips, one to each digit, thus 

 presenting the simplest condition possible and literally realizing Gadow's statement 

 that the flexor longus hallucis is really a common flexor of all digits. If a good generic 

 character is needed for Hemiproene [Streptoproene], here it is.

I have not seen specimens from the type locality of Hemiproene albieincta Cabanis 

 (Guiana) or contiguous territory, and the form here characterized as Streptoprocne 

 zonaris albieincta may possibly not be the same. In this case the name Streptoprocne 

 zonaris minor would have to be used instead, the type locality of Hemiproene minor 

 Lawrence being central Colombia (Bogota).

MEXICAN COLLARED SWIFT. 



Similar to 8. z. alMyiarchusincta, but averaging decidedly larger, general 

 color much duller (less bluish) black, and forehead always distinctly 

 grayish sooty; similar also to S. z. zonaris, a but averaging smaller 

 and coloration less uniform, the forehead and chin always distinctly 

 paler than rest of head. 



Adults (sexes alike). — General color plain black or sooty black 

 above, slightly more sooty below and decidedly more so on fore- 

 head, chin, and throat, interrupted by a conspicuous collar of white 

 (this broadest on chest), the feathers of this white collar dark sooty 

 brown or dusky basally; bill black; iris dark brown; legs and feet 

 dusky (more or less livid in life ?) . 



Immature. — Similar to adults, but white collar more or less broken 

 by larger dusky central areas to feathers (especially on chest), and 

 (in younger specimens) feathers of chin and upper throat streaked, 

 those of lower throat tipped with whitish, and those of breast and 

 abdomen and marginal under wing-coverts terminally margined with 

 whitish. 



Young. — Myiarchusch duller in color than adults, the under parts grayish 

 sooty anteriorly, dark sooty posteriorly; white collar developed only 

 on hindneck (where feathers are rather narrowly tipped with white), 

 the feathers of chest very narrowly margined terminally with white; 

 otherwise like the immature stage, described above. 



Adult male.— Length (skins), 183-225 (206.5); wing, 200-215

nigra Gmelin.) 

 Nephoecetes (emendation) Baird, Rep. Pacific R. R. Surv., ix, 1858, pp. xxix, 922. 

 Nephoecetes (emendation) Sclater, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1859, 236. 



Medium-sized Chseturine Swifts (length about 135-168 mm.) with 

 tarsus longer than middle toe with claw, hallux more than half as 

 long as inner toe, and tail decidedly to deeply emarginate, with 

 rectrices soft and with normal shafts. 



Nostrils elliptical or narrowly oval, nearly parallel, for the greater 

 part posterior to the latero-frontal antiae; distance from tips of 

 longest secondaries to that of longest primary decidedly less than 

 two-thirds the total length of wing; tenth (outermost) primary 

 longest; tail nearly two-fifths as long as wing, decidedly emarginate, 

 the rectrices rather soft, with shafts normal (not rigid, nor with ex- 

 truded tip); tarsus longer than middle toe with claw; outer toe as 

 long as middle toe, the inner slightly shorter; hallux (without claw) 

 more than half as long as inner toe (without claw); feet relatively 

 rather weak or slender. 



Coloration. — Mostly plain dark sooty, the sides of forehead more 

 or less hoary or whitish; adult females with feathers of posterior 

 under parts more or less distinctly tipped with whitish. 



Nidijication. — Nest in recesses among rocks h or about buildings, 

 composed of straw, feathers, leaves, bits of paper, etc., loosely put 

 together and not held together by salivary secretion." 



Range. — British Columbia and Montana to Costa Rica; West 

 Indies (Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, Guadeloupe, Myiarchusrtinique, and St. 

 Vincent); British Guiana. (Monotypic.) 



» Nephoecetes differs from all other North American genera of Swifts, at least, in 

 having seven (instead of six) pairs of complete ribs and in having the vomer not 

 expanded distally. (See Lucas, Auk, x, 1893, 365, 366.) 



& See Vrooman, Condor, vii, 1905, 176, 177, where the eggs are stated to be laid 

 on bare earth behind a tussock of grass, on a shelf or pocket of a cliff overhanging 

 the sea. Doubts have, however, been expressed as to correct identification in this 

 case. That N. niger oorealis does nest among rocks, however, I have reason to 

 believe from having seen a large colony at a cliff facing the Carson River near Fort 

 Churchill, Nevada, in June, 1868. (See Orn. 40th Parallel, 1877, 565, 566.)

a. General color decidedly grayish. (Haiti; Cuba?) Nephoecetes nigerniger (p. 704). 

 aa. General color distinctly blackish or dark snoty. 

 6. Smaller (wing averaging 154.5 in male, 150 in female) but tail longer (averaging 

 66 in male, 58.5 in female); female with white tips to feathers of posterior 

 under parts much less distinct. (Jamaica; Porto Rico?; Dominica?; Guade- 

 loupe?; St. Vincent?; Myiarchusrtinique?; British Guiana?) 



Nephoecetes niger jamaicensis (p. 705). 



66. Larger (wing averaging 159 or more in male, more than 157 in female) 'but 



tail shorter (averaging not more than 61 in male, less than 52 in female). 



c. Larger (wing averaging 165.8 in male, 162 in female), coloration slightly 



paler; female with white tips to feathers of posterior under parts averaging 



narrower. (British Columbia to southern Mexico.) 



Nephoecetes niger borealis (p. 707). 



cc. Smaller (wing averaging 159 in male, 157.1 in female); coloration slightly 



darker; female with white tips to feathers of posterior under parts averaging 



broader. (Costa Rica.) Nephoecetes niger costaricensis (p. 710). 



NEPH(ECETES NIGER NIGER (Gmelin). 



BLACK SWIFT. 



Adult male. a — Pileum and hindneck deep grayish brown or sooty, 

 passing into sooty blackish on back and other upper parts (the 

 wings and tail very faintly glossed with bluish); chin and throat 

 much lighter grayish brown passing into much darker sooty on under 

 parts of body and under tail-coverts (the color slightly darker than 

 that of pileum) ; feathers of forehead and crown narrowly margined 

 at tip with grayish white, these whitish tips much broader on sides 

 of forehead, blending on edge into a distinct whitish area bordering 

 the upper edge of the velvety black lores; marginal under wing- 

 coverts very narrowly margined terminally with pale grayish; bill 

 black; iris dark brown; legs and feet dusky (in dried skin); length 

 (skins), 155-158 (156.5); wing, 151-156 (153.5); tail, 62-63 (62.5) 

 (forked for 12); exposed culmen, 6-7 (6.5); tarsus, 12; middle toe, 

 8.5-9 (8.7). 6 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male but tail less emarginate 

 (nearly truncate), under parts paler, especially under parts of body 

 and under tail-coverts, which are nearly concolor with the throat, 

 the general color of the under parts being a clear sooty brownish 

 gray or grayish brown; in some specimens, the feathers of lower 

 abdomen indistinctly tipped with whitish; length (skins), 138-156 



o Described from a Cuban specimen, no adult male from Santo Domingo or Haiti 

 being available. This Cuban specimen is much paler in coloration than even adult 

 females of the Jamaican form, and, though slightly darker (especially on the under 

 parts) than adult females from Santo Domingo I believe will be found referable to 

 the same form.

NEPHCECETES NIGER BOREALIS (Kennedy). 



NORTHERN BLACK SWIFT. 



Adult male probably similar to that of N. n. niger (from Cuba), a but 

 larger; adult female similar to that of N. n. jamaicensis, but with 

 feathers of abdomen and under tail-coverts much more distinctly 

 tipped with white, these white tips often extending over whole of 

 under parts posterior to chest. 6 



a I have not been able to examine an adult male of N. n. niger from the type 

 locality (Santo Domingo). 



t> Supposed changes of plumage in this subspecies according to age are thus de- 

 ecribed by Myiarchus. Frank M. Drew, in Bull. Nutt. Orn. Club, vii, 1882, 182, 183: 



"An examination of ten birds of this species, taken at Howardsville, Colorado, in 

 1880 and 1881, leads me to believe that four years are necessary for them to acquire 

 their complete plumage. A young male of the year, taken September 17, was marked 

 as follows. General color dull black, every feather tipped with white, scarcely 

 appreciable on upper back and throat, broader on upper tail coverts and rump. 

 Crissum almost pure white. In birds of the second year the general plumage has a 

 brownish cast; feathers of back tipped with brown, the head whitish, belly feathers 

 yet broadly tipped with white. The third year the color is black, with a very faint 

 edging of white on under tail coverts. In the fourth year pure black, forehead hoary, 

 neck with a brownish wash. Feathers bordering the black loral crescent whitish." 



Myiarchus. Drew is undoubtedly mistaken, however, in assuming that the sexes are alike 

 in coloration, for all the sexed specimens examined by me, from whatever locality, 

 show that all those with white-tipped feathers on posterior under parts are females 

 and all those without these white-tipped feathers are males. This is true of all the 

 subspecies, except that in the West Indian forms these white tips are much less 

 distinct, sometimes nearly obsolete.

CYPSELOIDES BRUNNEITORQUES BRUNNEITORQUES (Lafresnaye). 



CHESTNUT-COLLARED SWIFT. 



Adult male. — Pileum sooty black, the feathers along each side, 

 immediately above the lores, narrowly margined or edged with 

 whitish; lores deep black posteriorly, more sooty anteriorly; chin, 

 throat, and malar region dark sooty grayish brown; a broad collar 

 round neck deep cinnamon-rufous or chestnut-rufous, sharply defined 

 and clearer in color on hindneck, usually more or less broken on 

 foreneck by dusky center to feathers; remainder of upper parts 

 sooty black, of under parts deep sooty grayish brown; bill black; iris 

 dark brown; feet grayish brown or dusky (in dried skins); length 

 (skins), 112-131 (122); wing, 120-133 (126.7); tail, 40.5-51 (45.3); 

 exposed culmen, 5.5-6.5 (5.8); tarsus, 11-13 (11.9); middle toe, 

 7-8.5 (8).° 



Adult female. — Similar to the adult male but without the rufous 

 collar, 6 which is entirely replaced by the general dark sooty color; 

 length (skins), 103-127 (116); wing, 121-130 (125.1); tail, 40-48 

 (43.4); exposed culmen, 5.5-6.5 (5.9); tarsus, 11-12.5 (11.8); middle 

 toe, 7.5-8.5 (7.8). c 



Young. — Similar to the adult female but texture of the plumage 

 different (softer) and general coloration somewhat paler, especially 

 on under parts, where, at least on flanks, abdomen, and under tail- 



a Seventeen specimens. 



Among the seventeen specimens examined whose sex was determined as female 

 by their respective collectors are five which have the rufous collar, exactly as in 

 adult males. Whether these indicate that the female eventually attains the colora- 

 tion of the adult male, or that the sex was erroneously determined is a question; 

 but I incline to the latter view.

"Stephens" i. e. Gmelin.) 



Small Chseturine Swifts (wing about 100-130 mm.) resembling 

 Oypseloides but with the hallux relatively much smaller (less than 

 half as long as inner toe) and with shafts of the rectrices more rigid, 

 usually conspicuously extruded terminally. 



Nostrils elliptical, nearly parallel, for the most part anterior to the 

 latero-frontal antise; distance from tip of longest secondary to that 

 of longest primary about two-thirds the total length of wing; tenth 

 and ninth primaries longest, usually nearly or quite equal in length, 

 but sometimes one or the other a little shorter, the tenth (outer- 

 most) more or less narrowed (sometimes subacuminate) terminally; 

 tail (to base of spines) less than two-ninths to more than one-third 

 as long as wing, truncate or slightly rounded, very firm, the shafts 

 very rigid and, usually, conspicuously extruded terminally, forming 

 spine-like tips; tarsus equal to or longer than middle toe with claw, 

 entirely naked, nonscutellate; outer toe slightly shorter, the inner 

 toe slightly to decidedly shorter, than middle toe; hallux very 

 small and weak, less than half as long as inner toe. 6 



Coloration. — Plain sooty or blackish, sometimes with a gray or 

 whitish rump-patch or band, one species with the rump, tail-coverts, 

 and tail light gray in contrast with rest of plumage. 



Nidification. — Nest in form of a half saucer or shallow cup, com- 

 posed of dried twigs glued together by salivary excretion and at- 

 tached by same substance to the inner wall of a hollow tree, chimney, 

 or similar place. 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OP CHjETURA. 



a. Under-parts ofbody and under tail-coverta gray or sooty, concolor with or paler

6 According to Lucas (Auk, xiii, 1896, 82) Chxtura (C. pelagica at least) is peculiar 

 among the North American genera of Swifts in lacking the deltoid muscle. This 

 muscle is present not only in other North American genera but also in Tachornis, 

 Streptoprocne^ Collocalia, and Myiarchuscropteryx (double in the last, single in the rest). It 

 is not known, however, whether it is present or absent in Panyptila, Claudia, Myiarchus- 

 cropus,- or Cypsehides, or other species of Chxtura than C. pelagica. (See Auk, xvi, 

 1899, 77, as to deltoid muscle in Streptoprocne.)

dd. Upper tail-coverts gray, or mostly so, like rump. 

 e. Upper tail-coverts partly blackish; under parts of body paler (as in 

 C. c. cinereiventris). (Grenada, Tobago, Trinidad, and Myiarchusrgarita Island, 



Venezuela.) Chsetura cinereiventris lawrencei (p. 727). 



ee. Upper tail-coverts entirely gray, like rump; under parts of body darker 

 (as in C. e.fumosa). (Caribbean slope, Nicaragua and Costa Rica.) 



Chsetura cinereiventris phseopygos (p. 727). 

 aa. Under parts of body black, or sooty black, conspicuously darker than color of 

 tail and tail-coverts. (St. Vincent and Grenada, Lesser Antilles; Tobago, 

 and Trinidad to Venezuela, eastern Peru, and northern Brazil.) 



Chaetura brachyura (p. 728). 



I am fully aware of the unsatisfactory character of the above 

 "key" so far as it relates to the group containing C. spinicauda 

 and 0. cinereiventris. This results mainly from paucity of material, 

 only two specimens of each of the forms designated and only three 

 examples of 0. cinereiventris lawrencei being available for compari- 

 son. Of C. cinereiventris phseopygos and what purports to be C. 

 fumosa (from western Costa Rica) there are, however, extensive 

 series ; and in the case of the latter I am convinced that if the birds 

 so identified really represent 0. fumosa the latter is not a form of 

 C. spinicauda, but, on the other hand, is very closely related to and 

 almost certainly only subspecifically distinct from 0. cinereiventris. 

 Indeed I am able to separate it from C. c. cinereiventris (from Brazil) 

 only by the much darker color of the under parts, which, however, 

 are colored precisely as in C. c. phseopygos, the rump and upper tail- 

 coverts being colored exactly as in 0. c. cinereiventris, whereas 0. 

 spinicauda has a very definite pale buffy gray band across the rump 

 (instead of a large area of purer or less yellowish gray), very abruptly 

 defined against the black of upper tail-coverts, the color of the back 

 and pileum being, moreover, sooty blackish instead of glossy bluish 

 or greenish black.

 rump and the upper tail-coverts sometimes very narrowly and indis- 

 tinctly tipped with paler ; rigid shafts of rectrices black ; wings slightly 

 glossy sooty blackish, the inner webs of remiges passing into grayish 

 brown toward edges; loral region blackish, the feathers along pro- 

 jecting edges of forehead and crown (especially the superciliary por- 

 tion) narrowly (sometimes very indistinctly or obsoletely) margined 

 with whitish; sides of head otherwise, sides of neck, and under parts 

 plain grayish brown (nearest dark hair brown, but more grayish),

Zygodactylous but heterodactylous and heteropelmous coraciiform 

 birds with myological formula AX and with the dorsal pteryla simple 

 (not forked) between shoulders. 



Palate schizognathous ; nasals holorhinal; basipterygoid processes 

 present; vomer present; metasternum 4-notched; spina interna ab- 

 sent, spina externa present Gong and bifid) ; coracoids touching but 

 not connected; hypotarsus complex; cervical vertebrae 15; complete 

 ribs, 4-5 pairs ; syrinx tracheo-bronchial ; only the left carotid artery 

 developed ; caeca present (but short) ; intestinal convolutions of type 

 VI; flexor tendons of type VIII; femoro-caudal and semitendinosus 

 muscles present, the accessory femoro-caudal absent; pterylosis pas- 

 serine, the spinal pteryla well defined from nape to oil-gland, not 

 forked; wing-coverts coraciine (middle coverts absent); oil-gland 

 nude ; af tershaf t of contour feathers very large ; no adult downs ; rec- 

 trices 12; tenth (outermost) primary very short; secondaries quinto- 

 cubital; young gymnopaedic. 



The Heterodactylae are a strongly characterized group of Coracii- 

 form birds which combine the cranial characters of the Caprimulgi, 

 the myological formula of the Alcedinidae ( = Anisodactylae, part), and 

 an oscinine pterylosis with an entirely unique arrangement of the toes 

 and the deep plantar tendons. Like the Pici and Cuculiformes, they 

 have the toes in pairs (two in front and two behind), and are therefore 

 to that extent zygodactylous ; but they differ from these two groups 

 and from all other birds in having the second digit (the inner front toe 

 of anisodactyle birds) reversed, instead of the outer toe; in other 

 words, the hallux is the outer of the two hind toes, whereas in all other 

 zygodactyle birds it is the inner one. This unique arrangement of 

 the toes is correlated with a unique arrangement of the deep plantar 

 tendons, the front one of which (the flexor perforans) is split into two, 

 leading, respectively, to the two front (third and fourth) toes, while 

 the hinder one (the flexor hallucis) is also divided, the two branches 

 leading, respectively, to the two posterior (first and second) toes — an 

 arrangement in strong contrast with those of the other zygodactyle 

 groups, in which the front plantar leads to the third digit only in the 

 Pici, while the hind plantar leads to the first digit (hallux) only in the 

 Cuculiformes.

The following characters are additional to those given under Sub- 

 order Heterodactylse: 



Bill short (much shorter than head), broad basally (triangular in 

 vertical profile), the culmen strongly decurved and terminally more 

 or less distinctly (but not conspicuously) uncinate; maxillary tomium 

 usually more or less serrate subterminally (smooth in one American 

 genus, PTiaromacJirus, and in most of the Old World forms) ; base of 

 bill concealed by well-developed, curved, antrorse latero-frontal, 

 pre-malar, and mental bristle- tipped feathers; feet weak, the tarsus 

 much shorter than longest anterior toe, chiefly (sometimes entirely) 

 feathered; anterior toes united for about the basal half; wing short, 

 rounded, very concave beneath; primaries more or less falcate or 

 subfalcate terminally, the tenth (outermost) decidedly shortest; 

 secondaries short; tail longer than wing, composed of twelve broad 

 and nearly truncate rectrices ; plumage dense and soft, easily detached ; 

 colors bright, brilliantly metallic (green, golden, coppery, blue, or 

 violet above) in adult males, the under parts of body pure red, orange, 

 or yellow; young usually spotted and without bright colors; nest in 

 holes of trees, stumps, etc.; eggs plain white or pale bluish. 



The Trogons are a well-marked group of Picarian birds, differing 

 from all others in the conformation of the feet, the inner toe being 

 reversed, or turned backward, instead of the outer, as is the case with 

 all other birds which have the toes in pairs. 



They are forest birds, and therefore arboreal, passing their entire 

 life among the trees, where they nest in natural cavities or those 

 abandoned by parrots or the larger woodpeckers. They feed chiefly 

 on fruits and insects, both of which they take while flying. As a 

 group the Trogons are celebrated for their beauty of plumage, some 

 of the species being among the most beautiful of birds, the magnifi- 

 cent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno), of Guatemala, excelling even 

 the famed Birds of Paradise in the gorgeous beauty of its plumage 

 and exquisite grace of form. 




*732 BULLETIN §0, trNlEEB STATES NATIONAL MyiarchusseTM. 



Like the Barbets, the Trogons are found in the Tropics of both 

 hemispheres ; but, unlike them, they are most numerous in America, 

 where eight genera and about thirty- two species occur. Two peculiar 

 genera, with a single species each, occur in Cuba and Haiti, 

 respectively.

Adult female. 6 - — Pileum and sides of head metallic bronze-green 

 (the color much less bright than in adult male) , the loral and latero- 

 frontal feathers much less developed; back, scapulars, wing-coverts, 

 rump, and upper tail-coverts bright metallic golden green, as in 



" I have not seen the female of P. m. mocinno, which, however, undoubtedly 

 agrees with that of P m. costaricensis in this character. 



& Not Quet'zal, as given in the dictionaries! The Central American native pro- 

 nunciation is uniformly and distinctly ka-tzal, or ka-zal. 



c Fifteen specimens. 



d The descriptions of the adult female and young stages are taken from specimens 

 of P.m. costaricensis (which probably do not differ materially from the same plumages 

 of P. m. mocinno), in order to preserve uniformity of treatment of composite species, 

 there being no specimens of P. m. mocinno other than adult males in the series which 

 I have been able to examine. The nestling described is the specimen recorded by 

 Myiarchus. Lawrence in his catalogue of Costa Rican birds as Nyctibius jamaicensis (no. 

 51269, coll. TJ. S. Nat. Myiarchuss., "San Jose"=Volcan de Irazu?, Costa Rica, Jan. 15, 

 1867; Jose 0. Zeled6n).

adult male, but the longer upper tail-coverts not reaching much, 

 if any, beyond tip of tail (often falling short of tip) ; remiges black, 

 the primaries broadly edged with buff; tail black, the three lateral 

 rectrices on each side broadly white distally and on outer web (except 

 basally), the white portion barred with dusky; chin and throat 

 grayish brown; foreneck and chest metallic green; breast, sides, and 

 abdomen (except extreme lower portion of the latter) plain grayish 

 brown (nearly hair brown) ; extreme lower abdomen, hinder flanks, 

 anal region, and under tail-coverts pure geranium red; thighs sooty 

 blackish, the lower feathers glossed with metallic green; bill blackish; 

 feet dusky (in dried skins). 



Immature male. — Similar to the adult female, but metallic green 

 of head, etc., brighter, bill yellow, breast, abdomen, and sides gray 

 instead of grayish brown, and distal portion of rectrices with more 

 white (the white portion with much fewer dusky bars). 



Young {nestling, sex not determined). — Pileum, hindneck, back, 

 scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts plain dark sooty brown 

 (nearly seal brown), some of the longer upper tail-coverts with a 

 narrow mesial terminal streak of dull tawny, the scapulars with 

 large but not well denned spots of tawny-buff; wings darker sooty 

 brown, the coverts (except primary coverts and alula) with very 

 large spots of tawny-buff, the remiges broadly edged with the same; 

 four middle rectrices wholly blackish brown, the lateral rectrices 

 (as far as developed) white; throat naked, the chin thinly covered 

 with loose- webbed feathers of dull tawny mixed with dusky; chest 

 dull tawny-ochraceous or clay color, rather broadly barred with 

 dark sooty brown, these bars indistinct anteriorly but very distinct 

 near posterior margin of chest, where the ochraceous area has a very 

 definite convex outline; rest of under parts white suffused with 

 buffy, especially on sides and flanks, which are rather broadly but 

 indistinctly barred with grayish dusky; bill and feet brownish (in 

 dried skin).

Rather large Trogons, most like Curucujus in structure but differ- 

 ing in smaller size, more strongly graduated tail, 'with rectrices more 

 truncated at tip, much white on lateral rectrices, and under parts 

 yellow or (in one species only) reddish orange.

To what group the generic name Harpaleus Cabanis and Heine (Myiarchuss. Hein., iv,

In adopting as the earliest name for this species Trogon curucui Linnaeus, I am 

 conscious of the fact that Myiarchus. Hellmayr, for whose determinations I have the greatest 

 respect, has reached a different conclusion by identifying the name in question 

 with T. collaris Vieillot. It is true that Linnaeus's T. curucui, a composite species, 

 includes T. collaris as well as the present species, and that the majority of the refer- 

 ences cited belong to T. collaris; but the diagnosis is evidently based solely on the 

 Yellow-bellied Green Cuckow of Edwards, which is unquestionably the species 

 generally known as Trogon atricollis Vieillot, the phrase "subtus fulvus," instead 

 of being an erroneous translation, being, to my mind, intended to describe the color 

 as represented on Edwards's plate, or, possibly, a slip or misprint for "subtus flavus."

 brown, vermiculated with grayish dusky, most of the feathers with 

 a very large roundish or subcordate spot of buff, deeper buff on 

 lesser coverts, paler on tertials, these spots margined with a dusky 

 line; remiges, primary coverts, alula, and lateral rectrices as in adult 

 female; an interrupted white orbital ring, lores grayish dusky;

Small Trogons, resembling Trogonurus, but differing in having the 

 tarsus densely feathered to base of toes, tail relatively shorter, and 

 nestling resembling adults in coloration. 



Bill stout, its depth at nostrils equal to its width at same point, the 

 culmen strongly arched, indistinctly ridged; gonys about as long as 

 mandibular rami, slightly to moderately convex, strongly ascending 

 terminally; interramal space broader at base than long; tomia dis- 

 tinctly serrate, especially on mandible, the tip of which forms a short 

 ascending point. Nostril roundish, margined above and behind by 

 membrane, mostly concealed by strong, antrorse, decurved latero- 

 frontal bristles. Eyelids naked, forming a rather broad orbital ring. 

 Feathers of malar apex and chin bristly, antrorse, the latter strongly 

 recurved; seventh and sixth primaries longest, the eighth a little 

 shorter, the tenth (outermost) about half as long as ninth; tail about 

 as long as wing (sometimes shorter), graduated for a little more than 

 one-third its length, the rectrices truncate (the lateral ones obliquely 

 so) at tip, the outermost moderately bowed basally. Tarsus about 



portion of inner web of outermost rectrix and basal half or more of inner web of next 

 two; middle and greater wing-coverts and secondaries delicately vermiculated with 

 black and white; rest of wing slate-blackish, the longer primaries edged with white; 

 under parts, posterior to chest, rich, pure orange-yellow (between lemon and cadmium, 

 but nearer to latter), margined anteriorly by a band of white across upper breast (next 

 to sooty color of chest), the feathers of tibia and upper portion of tarsus sooty black, 

 tipped with yellowish white; bill (in dried skin) grayish horn color, with tomia and 

 terminal half of culmen dull yellowish; feet horn color, in dried skin; length (skin), 

 238; wing, 110.5; tail, 140; culmen, 17; tarsus, 13; inner anterior toe, 14. (No. 

 127338, coll. U. S. Nat. Myiarchuss., Rio Escondido, Nicaragua, September 23, 1892; Charles 

 W. Richmond.) 



This bird agrees so perfectly in measurements, pattern of coloration of lateral rec- 

 trices, and color of under parts (posterior to the chest), that, in spite of the utter absence 

 of metallic coloring, I am now disposed to consider it an abnormal adult male of T. 

 curucui tenellus. The adult female described by Dr. Richmond as that of T. chry- 

 somelas is unquestionably referable to Chrysotrogon caligatus.

as long as middle toe, densely feathered for entire length; anterior 

 toes united for basal and part of second phalanx. 



Coloration. — Adult males with head and neck black, chest metallic 

 bluish green to violet-blue, back bright metallic green, upper tail- 

 coverts and middle rectrices metallic bluish green or greenish blue 

 (the latter broadly tipped with black), lateral rectrices barred with 

 black and white (except a terminal area of immaculate white) , wing- 

 coverts and secondaries minutely vermiculated with black and white, 

 and under parts posterior to chest rich orange-yellow; adult females 

 with slate color replacing all the metallic colors, as well as the black 

 of head and neck, the wing-coverts and secondaries narrowly barred 

 with white, and inner web of lateral rectrices wholly blackish except 

 the narrow white tip; young male similar to the adult male, but 

 chest, back, and middle rectrices dark sooty brown or sooty slate; 

 young female similar to the adult female, but the slate color darker 

 and more sooty. 



Range. — Southern Mexico to Ecuad6r, Amazon Valley, Guiana, 

 and Trinidad. (Three or four species. 15 ) 



KEY TO THE SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES OF CHRYSOTKOQON. 



a. Back, scapulars, rump, upper tail-coverts and middle rectrices bright metallic . 

 green and blue or greenish blue; no white orbital ring; wing-coverts and sec- 

 ondaries minutely vermiculated or freckled with white or gray, or else uniform 

 slate-black. (Adult males.) 

 b. Lower part of tarsus naked; bill broader basally, the interramal space relatively 

 larger and broader; pileum (except forehead) metallic blue or violet, 

 c. Culmen rounded, or at least not distinctly ridged; wing-coverts distinctly 

 (though minutely) freckled with pale gray. (Cayenne and Trinidad to 

 Caribbean slope of Colombia.) 



Chrysotrogon vlolaceus, adult male (extralimital).& 

 cc. Culmen distinctly ridged; wing-coverts not distinctly if at all freckled with 

 gray. (Chrysotrogon ramonianus.) 



a Although Trogon meridionalis Swainson and T. ramoniana Deville and Des Myiarchusrs 

 differ from the type of Chrysotrogon in having the extreme lower part of the tarsus bare, 

 and the plumage of their young is unknown, the adults resemble C. caligatus so closely 

 in coloration that I have little doubt they belong in the same genus.

I have not seen a specimen from Bahia, and assume that the bird from that district 

 may be the same as the Lower Amazon form. It certainly can not be either true 

 ramonianus or C. violaceus. But the Bahia bird may be a different form, in which 

 case I propose for the Pari bird the name Chrysotrogon. ramonianus goeldii. (Type, 

 no. 105,232, coll. U. S. Nat. Myiarchuss., Para, Brazil, Myiarchusrch 6, 1881; E. M. Brigham.) 



c With only one specimen of the Lower Amazon form, and none of C. ramonianus 

 ramonianus, I am not able to more satisfactorily characterize the females of these two 

 forms and C. violaceus.

Rather small Trogons agreeing with Temnotrogon in filamentous 

 auricular feathers, slight extent of cohesion of anterior toes, and 

 similarity of sexes in coloration, but differing conspicuously in form 

 of middle rectrices (which are concavely incised and laterally pointed, 

 terminally) and in conspicuous white subterminal spots on outer 

 webs of secondaries. 



Bill rather stout but broader than deep basally, the culmen moder- 

 ately arched, rounded (not ridged), the gonys about as long as man- 

 dibular rami, distinctly convex, strongly ascending terminally, the 

 tip of mandible forming a distinct but small ascending point; basal 

 width of interramal space about equal to its length; tomia distinctly 

 serrate. Nostril roundish, non-operculate, concealed, or nearly so,

 auricular feathers, which have elongated, filamentous tips, curved 

 outward; feathers of chin and malar apex bristle-like, antrorse, the 

 former strongly recurved; seventh, or seventh and sixth primaries 

 longest, the tenth (outermost) less than half as long as eighth; tail 

 longer than wing, the eight middle rectrices with tip strongly con- 

 cavely incised, with web on each side of the excision expanded and 

 prolonged into sub-falcate points, the two lateral pairs with tip 

 obliquely truncate or subtruncate, with inner web longest and usually 

 (at least in adult males) forming a blunt or rounded point. Tarsus 

 longer than longest anterior toe (without claw), naked for lower 

 half or more; anterior toes united for basal phalanx only. 



Coloration. — Pileum dark metallic violet-blue to greenish blue, 

 passing into black on sides of head; rest of upper parts except remiges 

 and lateral rectrices metallic green, more bluish on rump and upper 

 tail-coverts; remiges spotted with white, the lateral rectrices exten- 

 sively white terminally; anterior under parts, as far backward as 

 middle of abdomen, fight gray (the throat more whitish), posterior 

 under parts red. (Sexes alike.)
