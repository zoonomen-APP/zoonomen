	La Galerie des Oiseaux du cabinet d'histoire naturelle du jardin du roi.

	Vieillot, Louis Jean Pierre and Oud(t)art, Paul Louis	
	1820-6
	Paris
</pre>
	<li>See [Zimmer, 1926] and [Mathews, 1915, 1925] for discussions of
	the complex and confused publishing history.</li>

	<li>This work represents an enormous bibliographic challenge.
	This challenge is increased by the confusing treatment afforded this work
	by G.M. Mathews in 1915.  That treatment Mathews indicates was partial
	and incomplete; he re-summarized it with minimal added information in 1925.</li>

	<li>The situation is, at least in part, as follows.
	Zimmer's summary indicates that the work was<pre>
	planned to give colored figures of all the birds in the
	galleries of the Paris Museum, accompanied by brief general accounts
	of each.  Six livraisons were issued thus, with 24 plates by Oudart
	and with anonymous text which is probably also by Oudart since the
	dedication is signed by him.  This original matter forms the variously
	paged text and the unnumbered plates at the close of Vol. II.  The
	enormity of the project caused its abandonment and the substitution of
	a more modest program, with the writing and the text assigned to
	Vieillot, and livraisons 7-82 carried the work to completion.
	</pre></li>

	<li>Given that the work was issued in livraisons the problem
	devolves, in part, to determining which plates (and text) were
	contained in which livraisons, and then assigning dates to those
	livraisons.</li>

	<li>Mathews has taken the most systematic approach to this problem,
	In the AustralAv.Rec. 1915 <b>II</b>(7):153-158 he publishes his
	results which he indicates are incomplete.  He tells us that the
	data comes from the "Biblioth&egrave;que Fran&ccedil;aise" and he
	indicates that this if from the "number for Sept 2, 1820".  I am
	unable to find such an entity, but of interest, the Sept. 2, 1820
	number of the Bibliographie de la France contains a discussion (p.472)
	of this work containing <b>some</b> of the details that Mathews
	includes; the dates of the livraisons and listing of the number of
	plates contained therein is <b>not</b> a part of this, nor could it be, given that in
	1820 only the proposal of publication existed.
	After Mathews presentation (p.154) of details (that <b>could</b> have
	come from the Bibliographie de la France), Mathews indicates:<pre>

	The succeeding dates and contents follow :&#151;</pre>

	He appears to imply but does not explicitly state that the dates and contents that
	"follow" are from the "Biblioth&egrave;que Fran&ccedil;aise", though this is
	clearly impossible. Examination of the Bibliographie de la France shows no such dates
	or listings of content which could not have possibly come
	from this publication (dated Sept. 2, 1820) which announes the <b>plan</b> of
	the work, and could hardly document occurances up to six years in the future.</li>

	<li>In addition, Mathews evidently <b>assumes</b>, though he does not explicitly
	state, that the plates were issued serially in numerical order. If
	this assumption is not correct, Mathews' entire subsequent scheme
	collapses on itself, and Mathews provides no evidence for or against
	this (implicit) assumption.  At this point it is worth noting that a
	bibliographer with even a small part of Mathews' experience would not
	expect the plates to have been consistently issued in strict numerical
	order, several hundred plates are involved and it was common for there
	to be irregular delays in the production of plates.</li>

	<li>We have extremely strong theoretical grounds to believe that Mathews' assumption
	of numerically serial plate-production is more of a servant to convenience
	than to truth.</li>
	<li> What evidence, if any, do we have regarding the actual contents (by
	plate number) of the individual livraisons? Certainly, the bound copies are no
	testament to what the contents of the individual livraisons were, and I have never
	seen any indication of anyone examining a copy with the original wrappers, or a copy
	unbound with the original livraisons.</li>

	<li>The only evidence I know of that relates to this problem is in CW
	Richmond's unpublished notes on Dates of publication. There, Richmond
	has a number of cards including data of interest.
	He indicates that Livr.7 contains pll. 1,2, .. 4. (which fits with
	Mathews' scheme).
	He indicates that Livr. 8 contains pl.25 "Kakatoe rose". Mathews'
	approach would indicate that this livraison should include pll.
	5,6,7,8; so if Richmond's data are correct the sequence was 
	well out of register already in the second of the livraisons in which
	sequence should have been maintained. (It must be remembered that
	livraisons 1-6 do not enter into this sequence). Richmond indicates
	that Temminck "Pl.Col. refers to it in his livr. 14, texte."</li>

	<li>On these cards, which we presume are Richmond's working notes, he
	lists further plate contents of various livraisons (though it is usually
	unclear how he comes to know this). This listing shows.<ul>

	<li>Livr. 9 includes pll. 5,7 (9-12 predicted by Mathews' scheme)</li>
	<li>Livr. 11 includes pll. 8,9 (17-20 predicted by Mathews'
	scheme)</li>
	<li>Livr. 13 includes pl. 13 (predicted by Mathews'
	scheme to occur in livr.10)</li>
	<li>Livr. 16 includes pll. 21,22 (predicted by Mathews' scheme to
	occur in livr.12)</li>
	<li>{It also is worth noting that CWR includes pll. for livraison 16
	which is listed as "missing" from Mathews' collation. This
	listing would appear to provide support for the reasonable
	interpretation that the <b>data</b> are missing, and that the
	livraison actually was published.}</li>
	<li>Livr. 17 includes pl.49 (<i>Calopsitta Guy</i>) according to CWR, and is dated 1835. (from RI)</li>
	<li>Livr. 19 includes pl. 51 (Correctly predicted by Mathews' scheme
	to occur in livr.19)</li>
	<li>{Of interest in the 1915 paper Mathews predicted that pl. 50
	should occur in livraison 20, though he corrected this to 19 in his
	1925 summary.</li>
	<li>Livr. 20 includes pl. 53 (Correctly predicted by Mathews' scheme
	to occur in livr.20)</li>
	<li>Livr. 21 includes pl. 56,59 (Correctly predicted by Mathews'
	scheme to occur in livr.21)</li>
	<li>Livr. 23 includes pl. 64,65 (Correctly predicted by Mathews'
	scheme to occur in livr.23.)</li>
	<li>Livr. 29 includes pl. 90 (Correctly predicted by Mathews' scheme
	to occur in livr.29.)</li>
	<li>Livr. 43 includes pl. 143 (predicted by Mathews' scheme to occur
	in livr.42.) Richmond here indicates that his data come from
	Swainson Zool.J. <b>I</b>:299.</li>
	</ul>

<li>So some plates fit Mathews' scheme, and some do not.</li>

	pp. xxxiv,495   8vo     Breslau
        Issued in 7 Hft. 1-5, pp. 1-400 appeared in 1841.
	
	Mathews states: 
		"pt. VI. pp.410-480(?), 
			towards the end of 1841, but date not certain; 
		 pt VII, pp.477-496 and pp.i-xxxiv,. including preface, 
		 	dated Oct. 17th, 1841, 
		 and title page 
		 	1842, perhaps early in 1842, but it may have appeared in 1841 as cases
		 	where the title-page is dated ahead do occur in connection with
		 	German books, and even French, as Cuvier."

	Edward Dickinson kindly provided a copy of the Title page and facing sheet
	from the copy at the Mus.Hist.Nat. London. C. Davies Sherborn has a handwritten note
	detailing:
	Pt.1	pp.  1-80	1841 [<small>APP: dated prior to May 1841 by Thomas 1895 Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist.(6) <b>15</b>:189</small>]
	Pt.2	pp. 81-160	1841 [<small>APP: dated prior to May 1841 by Thomas 1895 Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist.(6) <b>15</b>:189</small>]
	Pt.3	pp.161-240	1841
	Pt.4	pp.241-320	1841
	Pt.5	pp.321-400	1841
	Pt.6	pp.401-496 I-XXXXLV	1842
	[APP: note that Sherborn does not refer to Pt.7, thus he did not count the parts correctly, 
	or did not understand the structure of the publication.]

	Sherborn's note generally agrees with the representation given by Zimmer, who in addition discusses at length
	the issues that relate to Pt.7 which was unacknowledged by sherborn.

	CWR's unpublished notes on dates of publication address this issue. His listing of the parts is:

	"Publ. in 7 parts
	I 	1841 	pp.  1-80
	II 	1841 	pp. 81-160
	III	1841	pp.161-240
	IV	1841	pp.241-320
	V	1841	pp.321-400
	VI 	1841	pp.401-477?
	VII	1842	pp.477? - (illegible) &amp; also intro. pp., title p. etc.
	The point of interest turns on the date for Heft 6.
	CWR's unpublished notes on dates of publication address this issue. 
	One of his relevant notes states:
	"I <u>know</u> that Pts. I-V were publ. in 1841, as they are so cited in Isis.
	Each one had 80 pages. As the last (VII) part contained the introd. matter, + this
	is <u>dated by Gloger</u> in <u>Oct</u>., 1841, it follows that Pt.6 
	<u>must have appeared before</u> Oct., 1841."

	My interpretation is that <b>historically</b> it is likely that Heft VI was written <b>before</b>
	Oct. 1841, and thus it is <b>likely</b> that it was published before 1842.
	However, unlike Hefte I-V, we do not have <b>corroborating evidence</b> that it was published 
	in 1841, so absent other indications, the ICZN Code 1999 Art. 21.2 indicates that for 
	nomenclatural reasons 1842 (the <b>specified</b> date) should be held to be the date of 
	publication.

	The logic here is a little problematic:
		ICZN "21.2 <b>Date specified.</b> the date of publication specified in a work is to be 
		adopted as correct in the absenced of evidence to the contrary."

	In this case, the date specified (1842) is "found to be incorrect" (language from 21.4) for 
	Hefte I-V.  based on the reviews in Isis and the dates for those Hefte is thus 1841. 
	These reviews do not cover Heft VI, so the question becomes
	is there "evidence to the contrary" for the publication of Heft VI in 1842.
	CWR felt that there was such evidence, but it may be regarded as probabalistic and 
	circumstantial.
	The Code appears to me to be quite casual and loose in it's progression of date requirements. 
	In 21.2 is indicates that the specified date is to be accepted "in the abscence of evidence 
	to the contrary", however no instructions are given as to how to evaluate or deal with 
	"evidence to the contrary".
	It's next instruction in this matter deals with what to do if the date "is found to be
	incorrect." While one can easily imagine (as in this instance) a situation where there
	may be "evidence to the contrary" but not <b>proof</b> that the specified date is incorrect.

	This gives the clearly incorrect impression, that those composing the code had either 
	slight and casual acquaintance with matters of bibliographic history, an unistructed 
	idea of legal logic, or both.

	My experience suggests that a frequent occurance is "evidence to the contrary" for a 
	specified date <b>without</b> the specified date having been "found to be incorrect."
	This kind of logical "never never land" is, of course, the main reason for computer programs 
	to fail.

	References of note here are:<ol>
	<li>Thomas, O., 1895. "An analysis of the mammalian generic names given 
	in Dr. C.W.L. Gloger's 'Naturgesischichte' (1841)."  <i>Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.</i> (6)16:189-193.</li>
	<li>Isis 1842 (Heft <b>v</b>, p.379).</li>
	</ol>
	As Thomas says the anonymous 'review' in 1842 seems to date Heft 3-5 
	(not 3-4 as given by Thomas) from 1841.

	as far as I can see, but changes some dates from 1812 to 1811 in the Corrigenda.

	Sherborn in Index Animalium has a casual mixture of dates for Vol. VIII pt.1 -- mostly
	1812 but a few to 1811. True resolution of the issue and resulting consistency does not
	seem to have been achieved by Sherborn.

	Mathews in his Bibliography of the Birds of Australia indicates (p.124) 
	"Vol. VIII, title-page, pt.I., 1811; title-page, pt. II. 1812." 

	Richmond's unpublished notes on Dates of Publication <!--S162.jpg-->, say that Vol. VIII was
	'To be publ. "in May, 1809" (See adv. in vol. VII, at back of "Directions for
	placing the plates in vol. VII part I")
	[But vol. 8, Pt I is dated 1811! [+1812 on engr. p.!]. ]'
	that Vol. VIII pt1 is dated 1811 on the engraved title page, and 1812 on the printed title page of pt2.
	The latter date (1812) is supported (as noted both by Zimmer and by Richmond) by an advertisement
	on in Vol. IX, pt1 that says Vol. VIII was published in 1812 (agreeing with the date on the engraved
	title page.

	[APP NOTE: In archival correspondence between CW Richmond, and Witmer Stone (1928.09.18)
	Richmond asks Stone to examine the set at the Academy with regards to the spelling of the name
	<i>Ortyx temminkii</i> (so spelled in the Div.Birds Copy, and the L. of C. copy).
	Notation at bottom of letter indicates Stone apparently confirms <i>temminkii</i> (no "c")
	in the Academy copy.
	CWR refers explicitly to his little pencil cross-mark in the margin (though Stone notes
	that this mark is not present in the Academy copy]

[2011.12.14] Dickinson <i>et al.</i> "Priority!" p.147 discuss this work, and state 
"We [?=ECD] recommend using 1812 for all of vol.8".
Part of the supporting argument given for this is that "Sherborn's entries in the <i>Index Animalium</i> 
for various names in <i>Certhia</i> ... date the new names from 1812."  
While it is true that Sherborn dates <strong>most</strong> of the new <i>Certhia</i> 
names to 1812 (25 of them actually), he does date <i>Certhia purpuratus</i> (p.5295 in my copy) to <strong>1811</strong>.

Sherborn dates 95 names in Gen.Zool. to 1812, and only 2 to 1811.  

My recommendation would be to regard this matter as unresolved, which is in accordance with Dickinson. The date 1812 looks
very likely, but 1811 can not be fully excluded.
