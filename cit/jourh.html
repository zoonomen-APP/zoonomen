	Vol II. by above authors and Alfred Moquin-Tandon
	3 vols and atlas 4to and folio

</pre>
<ul>
This work appears to be highly problematic both with regards attribution of authority
	and dates of publication. First I will discuss dates.
	<h2>Date</h2>
	<li>The entire work appears to have been issued from 1835-1850. </li>
	<li>Zimmer writes (p.666-667).<pre>
	The ornithological portion of Webb and Berhtelot's natural history ov the Canary Islands, published
	in the years 1835-50 (Vol. II, Zoology, 1835-44). The present section [APP: referring to pp.1-48, 
	pll.1-4 (col.; by E. Travi&eacute;s).] appears to have been issued as a unit (traces of original ?
	wrapper remain), forming a portion of Pt. 2 of Vol. II, and probably dating 1841. Dresser
	(A History of the Birds of Europe, 1871-82, q.v.) cites 1841, as does Koenig (Journal f&uuml;r
	Ornithologie, July and Oct., 1890, pp. 398, 404, and 483); a number of references are given in the 
	work itself to publications dated 1840. The paper describes 108 species of birds, 5 of which are 
	new, and gives observations on habits based on the field notes of Webb and Berthelot, of Moquin-
	Tandon, and of all three authors, the last being indicated by the subtitle transcribed above.</pre></li>

<li>Sherborn, in Index Animalium  pp.1410, 2838, 3090, 3461, 4079, and 6476 lists a number of avian taxa, and 
dates them all as "[me judice 1841]" -- which is certainly indicative of some uncertainty on his part.</li>

<li>Evidence from the Richmond Index, indicates that the situation may not be as simple as suggested by Zimmer.
A number of cards in the Index indicate greater complexity and the certainty that the work was not "issued
as a unit":<ul>
	<li><i>Puffinus columbinus</i> from p.44 and plate 4 fig. 2 of the work notes:<pre>
		Plate 4 (livr. 31) July 1838
		Text, pp.1-48 (livr. 63) May 1842</pre></li>
	<li><i>Fringilla teydea</i> from p.20 and plate 1 (Livr.4) of the work notes:<pre>
		Livr. 1-9 reviewed in Isis, 1837 and date given as 1835</pre>
		</ul>
<li>Richmond clearly worked quite hard on understanding this publication, as in his unpublished notes
on dates of publication he has 16 cards dealing with the dating and structure of the publication. A few 
extracts are included here:<ul> <!-- W007-W022.jpg -->
	<li>The Prospectus was rec'd by the Paris Academy by Nov. 15, 1835, and it stated 
		it was to be in 50 no's each containing some letterpress in quarto
		and 5 of 6 plates in folio. Thus even in the prospectus there was an indication of separate 
		format and thus possibly separate issue for the letterpress and plates.</li>
	<li>"Livs. I-VII. Paris. 1836" were reviewed in Mag.Zool.&amp;Bot. I 1837 p.470-482 where it was
	stated it was to be completed in 50 livr. and <pre>two numbers are published monthly".</pre> additionally
	in that review it is stated <pre>no part of the letter-press [of the Zoology] having yet appeared.</pre>
	Richmond goes on to comment on that card <pre>
	So the text of the <u>Zoology</u> must have started <u>after Livr.7.</u> 
	The only bird plate in the above livr. 1-7 is <u>Fringilla</u> <u>teydea</u>.</pre></li>
	<li>Livr. 1-7 text and Livr. 1-6 Atlas. were noted in the Bull.Sci.Imp.Acad.St.Petersburg. for
	Jan. 1837.</li>
	<li>50 Livraisons (3-4 signatures and 5-6 pll.) were reviewed in Isis 1839 p.700-713.</li>
	<li>Additional notes from multiple cards:<ul>
		<li>Livr.29-38 quarto text and pll. Paris 1836-38</li>
		<li>Livr.34 Atlas folio</li>
		<li>Livr.39,40	1838</li>
		<li>Livr.41-47	1839</li>
		<li>Livr.48-51	1840</li>
		<li>Livr.72&amp;73 rec'd by Paris Acad. by Feb.19, 1844</li> 
		<li>Livr.74 rec'd by Paris Acad. by May 6, 1844</li> 
		<li>Livr.77-80 1845 or early 1846.</li>
		</ul></li>
		</ul>
<li>For my part, some confusion still remains, and Zimmer's comment about references to works published 
in 1840 seems peculiar given the data and evidence that Richmond sets out. It does appear that Zimmer's
impression that the "present section appears to have been issued as a unit" is misleading regarding the 
historical production of this work. While it is speculation, it is possible that the copy Zimmer dealt with
was a subsequent re-issue of the work, in which case it might well have been issued as a unit and contained
references to works from 1840. "No.'s it must be noted, are not equivalent to livraisons in this instance.</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Authorship</h2>
Avian taxon names from this work are variably attributed to:<ul>
<li>"Webb &amp; Berthelot" (CBBM). </li>
<li>"Webb, Berthelot, &amp; Moquin-Tandon" (BWP; CWR)</li>
<li>"Moquin-Tandon"</li>
<li>Some works are irregular in their attributions, sometimes employing "Webb, Berthelot &amp;
Moquin-Tandon" while other times employing "Moquin-Tandon" without bothering to explain what 
(if any) rationale or understanding they have of the matter. The explanation by Zimmer (<i>v.s.</i>) 
certainly suggests to me that all three authors should be listed.</li>
<li>I have never seen this work, and so do not know if there are indications within it that would affect the
authorial attribution. It is quite clear that, as usual, Richmond had the deepest, most critical and 
knowledgable understanding here of any of those addressing this matter. He always listed the three authors
and I choose to follow his example.</li>

	Peters lists this as "Quad." which would imply the

This section addresses volume I.<p> 
I believe some issues are resolved here  for the first time, while other issues remain unresolved. 
Volume II is not addressed here.<p>
My motivation for studying this problem started in the early 1990's when I wondered over the inconsistency
of the AOU Checklists in dating the genus group names published in Vol. 1.
The interest increased when I examined the Richmond - Witmer Stone Correspondence in 2004.<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Two volumes of a proposed 4 were published.</li>
		<li>The work was issued as 22 livraisons each proposed to contain six plates with accompanying text.</li>
	</ul>

	Richmond states in 1899 (Richmond. 1899. Auk <b>16</b>(4):327 fn.1) that the first livraison was published 1 Dec. 1807, and this fact has been 
	used as the basis for dating the genus group names <b>Pinicola, Piranga,</b> and <b>Icteria</b> to 1807.<p>
	<img src="./image/Rich1899.jpg" alt="Richmond footnote 1899" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><br>

	(Note that this is volume <b>16</b> of the Auk, not volume <u>14</u> as cited by Dickinson (2016 Zootaxa Zookeys. 2016, 550:132).<p>

	In various works the three genera are dated to 1807 or 1808

			</ol>

	</ul>
No literature that I am aware of mentions, discusses, or explains the first 
appearance of 1808 in the 1931 AOU CL4. 
You will note it is the first time (at least that I can find) that 1808 is proposed, 
yet no subsequent authors mention its appearance there, or the possible rationale! 
As you will see, I am quite sure I know why it occurs there, what the rationale was,
and why that date is correct.<p> 

When it comes to dating the species names from this work, sadly the mystery is not yet solved. In this regard Edward Dickinson (Zool.Bibliogr.2011 <b>1</b>(3):136) is correct 
in his plea to find a copy of this work with the wrappers bound in place.<p>

The most recent treatments of this matter are due to Dickinson (Zoological Bibliography. 2011. <b>1</b>:136); 
expanded on in "Priority!", 2011 p.157); and then in ZooKeys 2016 <b>550</b>:123).<p> 
I interpret Dickinson’s thesis to be as follows: Richmond, used the <i>Journal Typographique et Bibliogrpahique</i> 
(hereinafter <i>J.T.B.</i>) <b>N<sup><small>o.</small></sup></b>XLIII:331-332 28 D&eacute;cembre 1807, to determine the date of publication. Dickinson interpretation is
that Richmond blundered by mistakenly believing the text to be an announcement when in fact it was an advertisement announcing a future publication. 
Dickinson appears to base this on his translation of the French text "<i>sera publi&eacute;</i>", which indeed means "will be published". 
Seizing on this, Dickinson holds that the <i>J.T.B.</i> text of Dec. 28, 1807 date is advertising a <b>future</b> event, and not an announcement as Richmond thought. 
In other words, Dickinson’s French expertise make something obvious to him that Richmond missed. Of note, Richmond's letters include segments of French material, untranslated,
and implying that Stone would understand them.  As to Richmond's proficiency in French I have no direct knowledge.<p>
Here is the <i>J.T.B.</i> notice.  (<i>J.T.B.</i>:331-332).<p>
	<img src="./image/JTB331a.jpg" alt="JournTypogr.etBiblio. 1807 p.331" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><br>
	<img src="./image/JTB332.jpg" alt="JournTypogr.etBiblio. 1807 p.332" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><br><p>
	You will note we are told that more than 400 species are described, and more than 500 described for the first time(!)
	(In a later announcement the "500" becomes "50" as you will see.)<p>

	A relevant portion of text (p.332) reads: <pre>"<i>Cet Ouvrage ser publi&eacute; par Souscription et par Livraison,...</i>"</pre>
	which means "This work will be published <b>by subscription</b> and issued as livraisons" (emphasis added).<br>
      	This could be referring to a future event, or a current ongoing process (publication by subscription as livraisons).<p>

Is there any evidence of a current ongoing process?
There certainly appears to be. Further on the text states:<pre>"... &agrave; commencer du 1<sup><small>er.</small></sup> décembre 1807..."</pre> 
indicating in late December that this activity had already commenced in the beginning of the month (1 December 1807).
This presumably was the basis for Richmond’s very reasonable interpretation that 1 December, 1807 is the date of initial publication.<p>

In <i>Priority!</i> p.157 (2011) Dickinson states 
<pre>“that in Jul 1808 the first livraison was still promised ‘to be published’ but now on 1 Sep 1808.”</pre> 
– his single-quoted phrase almost certainly referring to Dickinson’s translation of “sera publié” mentioned previously. 
Here Dickinson is referring to the text in the July 1808 <i>Mercure de France</i> (hereinafter <i>MdF</i>). 
Given Dickinson’s incomplete translation above, it seems best to check the facts.
The <i>MdF</i> text is here:<p>
	<img src="./image/MdF95.jpg" alt="Mem.deFrance 1808 p.95" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><br>
	<img src="./image/Mdf96.jpg" alt="Mem.deFrance 1808 p.96" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><br>
The relevant portion (p.96, first complete paragraph) reads: 
<pre>"&agrave; commencer du 1<sup><small>er.</small></sup> septembre <u>1807</u>,"</pre> (underlining added).
NOT 1808 as Dickinson states ("Priority! 2011 p.157; Zookeys 2016:123), but 1807, with publication commencing not in 1808 (as per Dickinson), but before that in September of 1807! 
Dickinson’s error here appears to be not a problem of translation/interpretation, but a simple error of fact.<p> 
<pre>
</pre>
Dickinson in his early publishing on the subject still seems to regard this as an advertisement,<br> 
(the text is quite similar to the <i>JTB</i> announcement).  
It is in a section of the <i>MdF</i> entitled “ANNONCES” (p.94).   (“Advertisements” and “Notices” are translation alternatives for this word.)<p>

<h4>Advertisement or Announcement?</h4>

In his first note (<i>Zool.Bibliog.</i> <b>1</b>(3):136) Dickinson stresses the difference between an announcement and an advertisement, and feels this critical difference “mislead” 
Richmond.  
Here Dickinson states: <pre>“In fact, the announcement is an advertisement…”.</pre> In <i>Priority!</i> he again states <pre>“but this is based on an advertisement”.</pre> 
Then in 2016 in <i>ZooKeys</i>, what had been called “an advertisement” changes. Dickinson now says: <pre> “What Richmond saw was merely an announcement..”</pre>
Even though the distinction had previously been held as critical to the case that critical distinction is now reduced. I am still uncertain why this is "merely" an announcement,
and exactly what that implies.<p>

The relevent ZooKeys text is as follows (emphasis added):<pre>
“The <i>Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l’Amerique septentrionale</i> of Vieillot: was discussed 
by Richmond (1899) who mistakenly believed, and seems to have led Browning and Monroe (1991) 
to believe, that the first part was published on 1 December, 1807. In fact what 
Richmond saw was merely an announcement that appeared four weeks after that saying it 
“will be published” on that date. A later notice in July 1808 changes the story and said that it 
“will be published” on 1 September <b>1808</b>. The date of each part that was suggested by 
Browning and Monroe was merely a projection of a very rapid, and almost certainly over-
optimistic, timetable based on a start date that was at least nine months out. Indeed, based 
on the delay of the first part, it is extremely unlikely that subsequent issues followed on schedule every month. 
But here we have no correct dates to use and for the moment the incorrect dates are retained to avoid 
premature changes to nomenclatural stability (Dickinson 2011).”</pre><p>

As we can see for ourselves, the text actually says 1807, not 1808.<p>


In fairness to Dickinson it appears he may never have seen these announcements himself. This possibility is suggested by his in-text reference in <i>Priority!</i> which reads. 

<pre>“(source: a further notice by Desray in the <i>Mercure de France</i> 33 (CCCLXIV), dated 9 Jul 1808 – 
accessible on Google Books: Neal Evanhuis <i>in litt.</i> 17.04.11)”.</pre>  
<p>
The speculative possibility of Dickinson not seeing the announcement is strengthened, in my view, by the fact that he does not give page numbers for either the <i>MdF</i> announcement, or the notice in the <i>J.T.B.</i>  Citations of published material conventionally contain page numbers or ranges of page numbers.
If Dickinson did not see the announcement it would be understandable that he would seize upon "sera publié" (without the following text) as simply saying “will be published” thus describing a future activity and perhaps more typical for an advertisement than an announcement, or "mere announcement".

Dickinson makes no mention of the change of month from December to September as the date of publication commencement. 
My speculation here is that Dickinson, having gotten the year wrong, 
and having become invested in his theory of further delay saw September as fitting that narrative very well.
But this is merely speculation.<p>
We, however, must still question the 1 September/1 December difference. I cannot currently solve that mystery, yet still some increased understanding of this work is to be had.<p>

<h4>Summary to this point.</h4> 

Review of texts contemporaneous to the publication of the work do not match Dickinson's published data. Dickinson’s apparent 
misinterpretation of the implication of the translation of the French appears to result from an incomplete understanding of or incomplete access to the material. 
It appears to be Dickinson rather than Richmond who is mistaken about the dates and timing, Dickinson also appears to have been mistaken about 
the nature of the published notices in <i>J.B.T.</i> and <i>MdF</i> both of which  appear to be announcements of published material, 
not simply "advertisements" that promise future events. Dickinson feels that the announcements “change[] the story”, and it appears
they do, but not in the way Dickinson interprets. The change is describing the commencement from "1 Dec. 1807" to "1 Sept. 1807", not from 1807 to 1808.
Dickinson in turns changes his story, initially emphasizing  the printed material as an advertisement rather than an announcement, and emphasizing that fact. 
Subsequently Dickinson refers to the material as a “mere announcement”, an interpretation he himself previously felt was responsible for Richmond being mislead.  
Dickinson's writings here appear to add to, rather than to reduce, error and confusion. His assumptions are not supported and he is incorrect as to one crucial fact. <p>

Vieillot's work thus has endured as a source of problematic interpretations.  <p>

<h4>Additional Data</h4>

Unknown, and unknowable to Dickinson, a 1930 letter from Richmond to Witmer Stone explains his decision to date the three genera 1808. 

His rationale has nothing to do with the reasoning that Dickinson confidently attributed to Richmond.<p>

Stone refers to his correspondence with Richmond in his obituary for Richmond (<i>Auk</i> <b>50</b>:1-22. 1933). I know of this letter and its contents because of my pursuit of the material, travelling to the (then) Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences where it was held.
In discussing the <i>Hist.Ois.Am.Sept.</i> (in the context of changes necessary for the 1931 AOU CL ed.4) he writes (dated July 8, 1930):<pre>
“I was of the opinion that the preliminary plate of generic outlines 
and text belonging to it were issued in the first part (Dec., 1807), 
but on getting out the work, to verify the generic names that would date from 1807 
I was shocked to discover that a list of errata up to p.65 were on the same leaf, 
hence could not have been published in the first part! 
We shall have to change the dates of Pinicola, Piranga, and Icteria at least to 1808.”</pre><p>

I think this explains why the 1931 AOU CL ed.4 was the first to have the 1808 date for these genera. <p>

Richmond had been aware (at least in 1899) that the preliminary matter included in the bound first volume was not printed until that volume was complete. 
Similarly, Dickinson (2011 <i>Priority!</i> p.158) understood this. He guessed (correctly this time) that this preliminary 
matter was printed at the time the end of the volume (which he correctly guesses was livr.10 -- for which <i>v.i.</i>) was being printed and that the preliminary matter would then be included at the front of the volume when bound.
He states (<i>Priority!</i> p.158): 
<pre>“this would move two generic names (<i>Pinicola</i> and <i>Piranga</i>), now dated 1807, back to Sep 1808”.</pre> 
A glance at the text shows three generic names (<b>Pinicola</b>, <b>Piranga</b>, and <b>Icteria</b>) not two.  

As discussed above, given Dickinson’s dating error, and his confusion regarding notice <i>vs.</i> advertisement, there is 
no reason why he would be intrigued by the “septembre” in the line announcing the commencement of publication.<p>

But WE certainly should be.  What happened to “1 Dec. 1807” which all of a sudden is 1 Sept. 1807?<p>

Patience and providence have combined and we can add to the tale.<p>

Mr Ben Lamb recently purchased a copy of volume 1 of this work (color plate edition) that had been in the Wassenaar Zoo library.<p>
This volume is described as having been acquired by the Wassenaar Zoo Library from the De Goederen firm in December 1952.<br>  
There is nothing in the volume itself to indicate its history beyond a small number inside the front board that was the zoo's own catalog number.
It was sold as the only example of the wrappers known.<p>
Sadly, the wrappers are bound at the back, so no definitive help is to be had in delineating livraison contents and limits.  But contributions to our understanding of the matter are still to be had.<p>
There are 10 wrappers, establishing that vol.1 was composed of 10 livraisons.<br>  
The work itself is composed of NUMBERED signatures. An exception to this is what must be the preliminary matter 
which starts with pages in a signature labelled “a”.  According to Leslie Overstreet of the Joseph F. Cullman 3rd Library of 
Natural History at the Smithsonian, it was a common practice for preliminary material to be printed AFTER the volume was otherwise complete.  
And this makes practical sense, a summary of the contents (and errata) can not possibly be published and released with the first livraison.
This preliminary material was then bound at the front – as seen in bound copies, and as anticipated by Dickinson, and Richmond. 
Understandably, the preliminary material had a different signature notation than the body of the work, with "a" as seen here being common.<p>

We have some advance of understanding simply from the number of wrappers (10). It seems convincing that the preliminary material 
including the generic names and errata in signature “a” could not have been published in 1807. Certainly not if publication commenced in 1 Dec 1807, 
and  would still be extremely unlikely even if it commenced in 1 September 1807.  
Either date of commencement would have required an impossibly fast publishing rate to complete the whole volume in 1 month or 5, 
and would have been completely unlike the proposed rate of 1 livraison per month.<p>
Therefore, 1808 is the appropriate date for the preliminary matter including the errata and three genus group names (<b>Pinicola</b>, the Evening Grosebeak,  <b>Piranga</b>  the Summer Tanager group, and <b>Icteria</b>, the Yellow-breasted Chat).<p>

Lamb describes his copy thus:<p>
“The plates and text are not bound in a logical manner - meaning the plates have not been positioned opposite the relevant text.  Rather the plates are inserted a few at a time between signatures of text.  It has occurred to me that this could be a clue to the contents of each livraison.  If someone had merely taken a stack of ten original parts to a binder and asked that they be bound, the binder having no other instructions would probably take off the wrappers, put the title in front and then just bind everything else in the order in which it was handed to him.  But I had not done a complete collation until this morning, and it's not obvious that this is what happened.”<p> 
Comparing Lamb’s collation with the livraison assignments made by Browning and Monroe only increases my confusion. We have, I believe, near complete uncertainty 
regarding the livraison contents and the order in which the material was published. While the Browning and Monroe livraison attributions can not be disproven, there 
appears to be very little support for them.  In my opinion the order and dating of all but the preliminary matter is not established, and is best treated as 1808.
This matches Dickinson's conclusion, but for very different reasons.<p>


So, what do these wrappers LOOK like, and what can be known, surmised, guessed, and imagined from them?<p>
Time to take a look.<p>
Here is the first.
<h4>Wrapper for livraison 1</h4>

</pre>
This last part can be translated as:<pre>
This work is available by subscription and issued as livraisons.  
Each livraison is composed of 6 plates accompanied by text to be delivered 
regularly on the first day of the month, beginning with September 1, 1807.  
	No advance payment is required.
</pre>
Comparison of this text with the published notices shows important differences and similarities.<p> 
There are different spellings (unimportant), differing use of diacritical marks (unimportant) and 
there is information given on the notices that is not seen here, for example the geographic range covered in the work. 
This additional information appears to come from the AVERTISSEMENT. The Avertissement, part of signature “1”, was undoubtedly issued 
with the release of livraison 1 (which would have lacked the preliminary material comprising signature “a”).<p>

The wrappers apparently were printed in at least one batch before the livraisons were printed and distributed. There are two indications of this. 
First, the aôut crossed out, with septembre written beneath, and second the handwritten entries for “Tome” and “livraison” at top of page.  
The wrappers would have been printed in anticipation of the Tome / livraison details being filled in when the livraisons were issued. 
The apparent original intent of an August start apparently was not met, that text was hand cancelled, and the actual starting date provided. 
The fact that every wrapper has an identical hand alteration from aôut to septembre implies a fact that was maintained to be correct 
through to the last livraison of the volume. 
Absent other evidence, this should be regarded as the date when the first livraison was delivered and not a year (or more) later as Dickinson interprets.<p>

The September commencement data is supported by the July 1808 <i>MdF</i> statement that the delivery of subscription livraisons commenced on 1 September, 1807. 
Presumably, the July 1808 <i>MdF</i> statement is simply taken from a livraison wrapper, with additional details supplied either from the Avertissement or from a previous notice.
Why this September date did not appear in the Dec. <i>J.T.B.</i> notice is not clear to me.<p>
Additionally note that the wrapper promises the Livraison on the first day of the month (obviously requiring printing in the month prior). I speculate that this may explain why aôut is crossed out and septembre written in. A delay in production that made livraison 1 miss the projected date, and slide from August into September.<p>

The December <i>JTB</i> announcement has text with word for word similarity to the wrapper.  
It also appears to have been composed (or set) in haste, with errors like announcing that the work contains 400 species accounts, 
and that over 500 [sic] of those are newly described. (corrected to 50 in later notices).<p> One wonders if this sloppy haste is responsible
for the "December" listing, which is found only on this notice.<p>

One appropriately might wonder what the other 9 wrappers show, and if that might help with this mystery.  
All 10 wrappers are identical, with the exception of the hand written numbers at the top.  
On the top line all have a handwritten “1” after the “Tome” and then handwritten numbers “1” thru “10” prior to “Livraison”.  
If that is helpful, I am not sure how. But we know all 10 livraisons were issued with a notice indicating that the publishing 
commenced on the 1st of September, 1807.
The writing on all 10 wrappers is in the same hand.<p>

<h4>Publishing date:</h4> 
All evidence points to publishing commencement in 1807. Possibly initially intended to start in August, but with wrappers uniformly indicating that it commenced 1 Sept. 1807.<p>

Is there evidence or proof of delay? I am not sure there is. It has been <b>assumed</b> there was delay, but I think this may 
simply reflect uncertainty about the dates of issue of the livraisons and their contents. 
It seems to me that the case is moot, in that even if we assume the livraisons were issued on the first of the month, starting 1 September, 1807, 
we still don’t know what was in each livraison. The first taxon (after the 1808 preliminary matter) of possible dating concern is <i>Accipiter striatus</i> on p.42 and pl.14. 
At 6 plates per livraison that <b>MIGHT</b> be livraison 3 (as Browning and Monroe have it), and <b>might</b> have been published in November, 1807. 
Already we are up to two “mights”. The collation of Lamb’s volume would support, but certainly not prove livraison 3 as containing pl.14 but not page 42.<p>

Wrappers 1-10 (each hand numbered 1er behind the printed ‘Tome’ and 1-10 before the printed ‘Livraison’)</pre>

The preliminary matter (sig. a) certainly was printed upon completion of vol. 1, putting it in 1808 unless all 10 livraisons 
were published between 1 September and 31 December 1807 – a likelihood so improbable it is not worth considering. 
Thus, placing the preliminary matter in 1808 makes sense, as Richmond understood and commented on to Stone in his July 1930 letter. 
However, in contrast to his understanding in 1899, Richmond felt that all of the material in vol. 1 therefore needed to be dated to 1808 (or possibly later).<p> 

Interestingly, Dickinson makes no mention of the important list of errata found on p.[iv] in signature "a".
I show them here on the same page where <b>Pinicola</b>, <b>Piranga</b>, and <b>Icteria</b> occur.<p>
	<img src="./image/HNOASiv.jpg" alt="Hist.Nat.Ois.Am.Sept. livr.1 p.iv" width="442" height="642" style="veritcl-align top"><p>

	<h4>Distribution of the plates and text pages of the first 10 livraisons.</h4>
Sadly, my opinion is that for the moment we have no advance in understanding on this important point.  
Even a guess as to 1807 versus 1808 for the species group names would require our needing to know which plates and text appeared in which livraisons.

If the livraison attribution suggested by Browning and Monroe is in fact is correct, it suggests to me that the livraison contents 
are not in anything close to numerical order, a possibility supported by the collation of Lamb’s vol.
Browning and Monroe’s assignation of taxa and plates to livraisons appears to me to be based on these assumptions:<ol>
	<li>A 1 Dec. 1807 start of publication.</li>
	<li>6, or close to 6 plates per livraison (consistent with the proposal on the wrapper).</li>
	<li>Plates published in numerical order (or very close to it).</li>
	<li>Appropriate text accompanying the plates in the same livraison.</li>
	<li>or assurance of essentially consistent numerical order of text pages.</li>
</ol>
The first assumption appears correct, as to the second, it may be correct, but I see no strong support for the other assumptions.

<h4>Summary:</h4>
For volume one, the genera clearly should be dated to 1808.<p> 
While a few specific names might eventually be demonstrated to have been published in 1807, such a possibility remains 
speculative and I do not see adequate evidence to determine to which cases it can applied with certainty.
Thus all names in volume one are best dated to 1808 in the absence of other evidence.<p>
Despite the <b>considerable</b> differences in interpretation, and despite data errors by Dickinson,
my recommendation for dates here does not differ from his.
