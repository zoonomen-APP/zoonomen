At question is the date of publication (date of availability)
of Volume VIII-A (Mammalia and Ornithology), Peale of 
The United States Exploring Expedition.

Generally this is cited to 1848 (the imprint date).

The complex and vexed matter of the entire Exploring Expedition and
its publications is discussed at length in:
Haskell, DC. "The United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842 and its
Publications. 1844-1874." The New York Public Library. 1942. 

Volume VIII-A (Peale, Mammalia and Ornithology) is treated on pp.54-63.

Haskell's presentation suggests to me this summary for Volume VIII-A
(Peale's volume of text treating "Mammalia and Ornithology"):

Peale completes the text in early 1848; this version of Volume VIII would have 
limited distribution as discussed below, and would not have the intended
accompanying atlas. Plates were produced with Cassin's later volume VIII-B.
Cassin's replacement volume is often referred to as an "Edition" of "The
Mammalia and Ornithology" of the expedition.  It is, however, a new work, and
not an "edition".

Haskell in his section "Date of distribution" notes that a 
letter of June 5, 1849 states that 70 copies had been sent to 
the Department of State the previous week.

The number of copies <b>printed</b> remains uncertain.  The enacting
legislation limited the work to 100 copies, but there may have been
only 87, as a bill for 87 copies was presented by the printer, C. Sherman
(Haskell p.55),

The number of <b>extant</b> copies of Peale's volume is even more of a question,
one that starts with uncertainty about the original number printed.

It is known that 70 copies were reported as received by the Department of
State in late May 1849 (Haskell p.55).  The Department of State was the entity
responsible for distributing the copies, so it is reasonable to regard this
time (early 1849) as the date of "publication". This is Haskell's position.

It seems to me that the only remaining possibility of "publication" involves 
the Library of Congress. A List of holdings of the work (Haskell p.144) 
shows the LOC holding only a single copy. Availability of a <b>single</b>
copy would not satisfy the current requirement for publication.

However, two copies were apparently were INTENDED to be placed in the 
Library of Congress (Haskell p.9), though only a single copy is recorded 
present at the Library at the time of Haskell's research. If it were
demonstrated that two copies were present and available at the LOC in 1848
that would appear to satisfy the requirement of the Code, and the publication
date would appropriately be considered 1848.  Absent such demonstration of 
multiple (2) copies AND availability at the LOC, I feel the case for 1848
is not proved, and in fact is unlikely.

It is not uncommon to point to Mathews as a source for 1848 as a publication
date for this work.

Mathews in his 1925 Bibliographic supplement to Birds of Australia 
notes: that this was "initially published in or before October of 1848" (p.105).
The basis for this assertion is not given and given the knowledge from
Haskell which was unknown to Mathews, it is not clear if this action
in of before October of 1848 meets the requirement for publication.
In this entry, Mathews is somewhat casual with his bibliographic terms. 
He refers to Cassin's subsequently issued volume VIII (referred to by Haskell
as "VIII-B") as a "second edition", which it emphatically is NOT.

If it were demonstrated that two copies were deposited at the LOC and 
available in 1848, then 1848 would need consideration as the date of 
publication. Absent documentation of this speculative possibility,
I feel 1849 must be held to be the date of publication.  This follows
Haskell's position (Haskell p.55).

Further weakening the possibility of the LOC being a site where the publication
was available is the fact that the <b>current</b> copy held by the LOC was 
obtained <b>on exchange</b> from the NY Public Library in April 1941.
