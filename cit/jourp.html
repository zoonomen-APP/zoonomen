	often conveniently, usefully, and unambiguously as PZS.
	but peers favored using the fuller and more cumbrous title,
	perhaps feeling it to be more scholarly.

	Title varies.

	See PZS 1937 vol. 107 pt.1 April (Duncan)  for a listing of dates of
	publication of the parts and numbers.

	Note, that Duncan's very helpful publication is often used as the source
		of authority for dates of publication for this serial.
	It appears to me that most of Duncan's data is simply a replication of 
	the material that Sclater presented to the Society and that was 
	published in the 1893 volume. It is interesting that these dates are
	"dates of receipt from the printers of the sheets of the 
	Society's 'Proceedings'".
	It is a small and picky point, but the date of receipt of the "sheets"
	might preceed the date of "publication" (as defined by the ICZN) by a 
	variable, but presumably short period.

	An additional matter, that I have not seen discussed is the fact that
	the Society published 30 copies of the reprints of their articles (see for example
	1923 pt.1 p.[1] #4). I interpret these to be essentially author's preprints
	which could, at least in theory, be distributed to authors and then further
	distributed by them prior to the publication of the completed part.
	(Note: that it has been established that this serial was published in
	two states (both ongoing parts as they were completed and final collections
	including all the parts in a volume).  So the possibility of yet another (third)
	state of publication must be considered.

 After 1860 The Proceedings were published in three parts every year, "in the months of May, 
 August, and February, the part published in February completing the volume for the preceeding
 year."

 Starting in 1890 the Proceedings "for each year [were] issued in four parts, on the
 first of the months of June, August, October, and April, the part published in
 April completing the volume for the preceeding year."

	It is vitally important to understand that the Proceedings are demonstrated to exist 
	in more than one "state". Edward Dickinson (<i>in litt.</i>) investigated the date status
	of <i>Calyptomena whiteheadi</i> as it appeared that 1888 was a likely date, while the
	Richmond Index (and Duncan's listing) indicated 1887. I understood it was Edward's intention
	to publish his findings.

	Initially Edward indicated to me that he thought that Richmond's date of 1887 was an error,
	and felt that no other interpretation was possible other than error on Richmond's part.
	(He seemed quite pleased by the idea of Richmond having made an error and felt that any suggestion
	of 1887 being correct was "ridiculous and illogical.") In support of his position
	he sent me a xerox copy of the page in question which included a running head referring to
	the November meeting (the Calyptomena sp. was described in the July meeting); the November meeting
	is known to have been published in 1888 <b>not</b> 1887. I speculated on the possibility of
	two (or more) states of the publication, based on having read notices in the Proceedings
	that the Society wanted subscribers to indicate whether they wanted their subscriptions filled
	as the numbers became available or as volumes were completed.
	Subsequently it is demonstrated that in one "state" the page in question has a blank
	lower half, and a running head referring to the July meeting. Only in the form that evidently
	was published for distribution as a completed volume (as opposed to individual numbers) is the
	lower half of the page printed, and the running head changed to refer to the November meeting.

	Despite his vehement opposition to the interpretation of the possibility of two "states"
	Dickinson's indefatigable efforts demonstrated that my thesis was in fact correct.

	Dickinson in fact became such an avid student of my thesis, and its implications that he prepared
	a more extensive treatment of this matter, which was published in J.Zool. <b>266</b>:427-430. 2005.

	This date structure was apparently understood by Duncan, though he gives no comment on this issue.
	CW Richmond also clearly understood the nature of this problem (<b>long</b> before Duncan ever
	began work on his compilation). From my point of view this suggests that CW Richmond knew 
	at least as much as Duncan about the history of this publication, and quite possibly more as he 
	was working at a time more contemporaneous to the publication itself.

	The important lesson here is that simply looking at a given set of the Proceedings may
	easily lead to the wrong conclusion regarding the date of publication.

	I encounter workers that seem eager to dismiss the nature and quality of the data in the 
	Richmond Index. This is unfortunate, as the quality of the data contained therein is, 
	in my opinion, superb, and it creates the unfortunate situation where the interpretation 
	that comes to mind is that the criticisms or skepticisms of the Richmond Index stem from 
	its not being available or conventionally used. This seems a tragedy, as when it was available 
	it cost (at $400) less than a <b>single</b> volume of the Cat.BirdsBr.Museum which in comparison 
	is a relatively weak resource of much more variable quality than Richmond's Index.

	"Del." = Date of delivery

	Note, that Duncan's very helpful publication is often used as the source
		of authority for dates of publication for this serial.
	It appears to me that most of Duncan's data is simply a replication of 
	the material that Sclater presented to the Society and that was 
	published in the 1893 volume. It is interesting that these dates are
	"dates of receipt from the printers of the sheets of the 
	Society's 'Proceedings'".
	It is a small and picky point, but the date of receipt of the "sheets"
	might preceed the date of "publication" (as defined by the ICZN) by a 
	variable, but presumably short period.
	Duncan refers to the "lists of dates of publication of the 'Proceedings' 1830-1859 compiled
	by the late F.H. Waterhouse" (p.77) but remarkably makes no reference to the list
	published in the Prodeedings and presented by Sclater. Indeed it appears that Waterhouse
	may simply have replicated Sclater's list!

	2014.12.05

	Additionally, I learn from Dr David Donsker that the PZS was offered
	in at least two ways: "with plates for a pound and change and w/o plates
	for six shillings. In addtion, some volumes with plates are 
	hand colored and others were issued only with B&amp;W plates."
	Donsker speculates that some delay may have occured with those 
	sets having colored plates.

"From an examination of the available account-books it appears that up to,
and including the year 1860, payments were made always for sheets, and
presumably the 'Proceedings' were available in that form as well as in the
three paper-bound annual parts. Beginning with the year 1861, payments
were made only for each completed part, and the issue of separate sheets seems
to have ceased." (Duncan, 1937 p.71).

<li>Duncan does not list a "Part" that continues from those above.
<li>The Richmond Index <b>DOES</b> list part numbers continuing
	so that, for example examples from 1859 have both "pt.XXVII"
	<b>and</b> "pt.3". I reflect this in my citations by including
	both Parts indicated by Richmond.
<li>Examination of some <b>bound</b> copies of the Proceedings, have
	so far left it uncertain exactly what was printed on the individual
	covers for the parts.
<li>My suspicion is that the Richmond Index may accurately reflect the
	covers in which (at least some of) the Proceedings were issued.
<li>The fact that at least at some times subscriptions were available in
	different schedules adds uncertainty to all this, and suggests that
	a single set examined may not solve the mystery.

After 1860 The Proceedings were published in three parts every year. In the 
1864 number the pattern of publication is described thusly in endpapers to the 
volume: 
"in the months of May, August, and February, the part published in 
February completing the volume for the preceeding year."
	This description does not match the history given by Duncan in his 1937 publication.

Starting with this year (1861) Richmond lists only Part I, II, or III for a particular year.

	In 1874 the Proceedings were published in four parts instead of three.
	Part I: 	Papers read in Jan. and Feb.
	Part II: 	Papers read in March and April
	Part III:	Papers read in May and June
	Part IV:	Papers read in Nov. and Dec.

	Thus it seems there was a summer recess with no papers read July-Oct.
	Duncan has a note concerning the four parts of year 1874:
	"I have been unable to see copies of thse four parts with their
	original covers.  Probable pagination is given between brackets."

	This implies the original covers are necessary for determination of
	"Part" limits at least during this period.

	In 1874 the Proceedings were published in four parts instead of three.
	Part I: 	Papers read in Jan. and Feb.
	Part II: 	Papers read in March and April
	Part III:	Papers read in May and June
	Part IV:	Papers read in Nov. and Dec.

	Thus it seems there was a summer recess with no papers read July-Oct.
	Duncan has a note concerning the four parts of year 1874:
	"I have been unable to see copies of thse four parts with their
	original covers.  Probable pagination is given between brackets."

	This implies the original covers are necessary for determination of
	"Part" limits at least during this period.

>From 1901-1906 the Proceedings were issued in two volumes for each year,
each with separate pagination (!). This not surprisingly lead to 
confusion, and made it a necessity (often unrecognized) that
the volume number be included in a citation.

To quote Duncan (p.75): 
'Beginning in 1903, Vol. II Part. I., the actual date of publication of the
previous part was printed on the back page of the cover --" 'Proceedings,'
1903, Vol. I Part. II., was published on August 6th, 1903" -- and this is still
continued.'

Note: Beginning in 1904, and continuing until 1958, "Abstracts" of
the Proceedings were publised well in advance of the Proceedings
themselves.  This fact appears to have been unknown to Duncan, or at
least not mentioned in his review article.  The Richmond Index lists at
least two taxa (<i>Babax waddelli</i> and <i>Pitta douglasi</i>) with
descriptions published in the Abstracts 6 months prior to their
publication in the Proceedings. I enquired of Ann Sylph, librarian to
the Society, regarding these abstracts, and her response is as
follows:<pre>
'Thank you for your enquiry, yours is the first I have received about the
abstracts and I had not really looked at them before.
 
According to P. Chalmers Mitchell in Centenary history of the Zoological
Society of London 1929.
 
"from 1904 on the Society has issued an "Abstract of the Scientific
Proceedings" on the Monday following each Tuesday's Scientific Meeting,
and [in] this, if it be required, new names with their diagnoses can be
printed. A a further bibliographic convenience there was adopted in 1904
the practice of printing on the cover of each Part of the Proceedings
(the annual volume is published actually in four quarterly "Parts") the
exact day on which the preceding Part appeared. The confusion between
real dates and the often inexact dates on the publications therefore no
longer exists in the case of our Proceedings."
 
This sequence seems to finish with Abstract no. 401 dated Nov 24th, 1936.'

Edward Dickinson pursued further matters that were suggested by some apparent
irregularities in Duncan's expostion, and established further addtional data.
I reproduce here his table of page breaks, as first published in the 
Journal of Zoology <b>266</b>: 427-430. I have added some additional notes and queries.

	Dates of publication are a question here.
	Numerous Lichtenstein taxa are listed as "1838".
	The Richmond Index in the entry for <b><i>Hylomanes</i></b>, 
	published in the volume for 1838, has a note
	that says "One t.p. says '1839' + another '1840'"
	The Index lists this taxon as 1840.
	The Richmond Index in the entry for <b><i>Hemignathus</i></b>, 
	published in the volume for 1838, has a note
	that says "One t.p. says '1839' + another '1840'"
	with an additional note that says:
	"Isis quotes the date as 1839.
	Rchb. in 1853 quotes the date as '1840'"
	The Index lists this taxon as 1840.
	In support of the 1840 date, Neave Index Zoologicus, and
	Sherborn all give a date of 1840 for <i><b>Hemignathus</i></b>.
	Olson SL and James HF, address this issue in
	<cite>Olson & James. 1995. Nomenclature of the Hawaiian Akialoas and
	Nukupuus (Aves: Drepanidini). Proc.Biol.Soc.Wash. 108(3):373-387.</cite>
	The date of "1839" as argued by Olson and James appears to have the
	best literature support. They do not discuss the evident comment
	by Reichenbach which would appear to be the main documented support
	for the year "1840". (Logically, given the history of publication
	for this series, I think 1840 is most likely <b>historically</b> 
	correct but can not disagree with Olson and James' nomenclatural 
	argument for 1839.

	They cite a review in Isis von Oken (1844, Heft XI: col. 842-854).
	That gives these dates of appearance for the volumes of the 
	Abh. der Berliner Academie:
	1832=1834
	1833=1835
	1834=1836
	1835=1837
	1836=(no entry)
	1837=1839
	1838=1839	(O&J question the possibility of a typo here)
	1839=1841
	1840=1842
	1841=1843.

	[Notes from the Society's Website:

	The name of the Society has remained much the same since 1772 except for the
	addition of the royal designation, and orthographic changes in the Swedish
	words for "physiographic" and "royal". The spelling Physiographiska appears
	to have been used as late as 1838; the spelling Fysiografiska appears to
	have been used as early as 1899. We find Kongliga (and Kongl.) as late as
	1911 in a publication of the society entitled Eine neue Methode zur
	Zuckerbestimmung. It seems likely, however, that the change to Kungliga (and
	Kungl.) was complete by the end of World War One.]

	Jan Kaiser also notes:
	"...the Society was founded in 1772. In became "royal"
	[kongliga or kungliga as it is written from 1919} in 1778, so it very well
	may be that volume 1 of the Handlingar [Proceedings] were published in 1776."

<ul>

	<li>* Regarding the date of livraison 57, Browning and Monroe state (p.394):<ul>
	<li>"We agree with Zimmer's (<i>op. cit</i>) summary for the years of the 
	different livraisons with the exception of livraison 57 which he dated 
	as April 1825. Specimens forming the basis of <i>Glaucopis aterrimus</i>,
	proposed in livraison 57, could not have been available to Temminck until
	8 October 1828, and the livraison could not possibly have been published 
	earlier than October 1828 (Mees, 1986)."</li>
	<p>
	</ul>

	Dickinson 2001 notes:<ul>
	<li>'The premature appearance of <i>Glaucopis aterrimus</i>. Livraison 57 (Apr. 23, 1825).
	<p>  
	  In part one of this report mention was made of another 
	irregularity discovered by Mees (1986), and reiterated 
	by Browning &amp Monroe (1991). The name <i>Platysmurus leucopterus aterrimus</i> 
	(Temminck, 1825), based on <i>Glaucopis aterrimus</i> Temminck (pl. 265, livraison 45) 
	caused Mees concern. He had noted that Temminck said that the specimens, 
	collected around Pontianak on the west coast of Borneo, had come from 
	Diard and were in Leiden, and that Leiden's records showed his collection 
	arrived on October 8, 1828. Mees concluded that Temminck's decription 
	could not have appeared before October 1828 and that the currently accepted 
	date of 1825 must be incorrect. "Something remains to be cleared up here" Mees wrote. 
	<p>
	  The cases examined above demonstrate that Temminck was willing to issue 
	supplementary text and to assign numbers to the pages that assisted with 
	filing or binding. He was it appears insensitive to future dating requirements.
	<p>
	  In this instance we are concerned with the question of what text was 
	  inseparable from that with plate 337 (of <i>Glaucopsis temnura</i>) 
	  and what text was on wholly different pages? The answer is that the 
	  leaf of text with plate 337 is printed on both sides and it mentions 
	  two species, <i>G. temnura</i> on the front and <i>G. aterrimus</i> 
	  on the back. Both this text and the separate text on the genus 
	  (two pages, with three of the four sides printed) are marked "livraison 57". 
	  The conclusion must, therefore, be that a later issue of text for both 
	  species, with printing on the second side, superseded the page of text 
	  for plate 337, originally issued with printing on one side only. 
	  <p>
		If it is clear how this text may be found where it is, then it is 
	  unfortunately still unclear when this substitution took place. 
	  For now it is suggested that it be dated from livraison 80 (Sept. 5, 1829), 
	  which is the first livraison that appeared after October 1828. 
	  Lesson (1830: 341) uses the name and it is just conceivable 
	  that he was the first to do so. Only discovery of a notice of 
	  cancellation and substitution will allow better dating or show 
	  that Lesson was the original describer.'</li>
</ul>
<p>
		<li>** The dates for the livraisons are almost always Saturdays, with a few other days 
		of the week. The date for livraison 63 (Oct. 9 1825) is a Sunday. This seems unusual to me
		but I don't know if it is reasonable or not.</li>
<p>
<li>*** This livraison is often listed "[1827]". Dickinson explains:<br />
'The third difference noted by Browning and Monroe (1991), but accepted, 
concerned livraison 75. Sherborn (1898), wrote "There appears no reason 
to doubt that Crotch's list for the remaining livraisons is correct, 
with the exception of livraison 75, which was received at the Linnean 
Society's Library in 1827, and should therefore be so dated" and 
his subsequent table of dates added "1827" in a square bracket after Jan. 1828. 
In fact Crotch's "5 Jan. 1828" seems perfectly possible on the evidence of the 
Linnean Society's Donation Book. This has been kindly examined by Alwyne Wheeler 
who found that livraisons 74 and 75 were received together on January 25, 1828 
from "G.B. Sowerby". Zimmer (1926) simply used "1827" without further explanation, 
but should not be followed in this. Crotch's date should be used. ' <ul>
	<li>While I doubt it adds any significant weight to the arguments here, 
	Jan 5, 1828, as indicated by Crotch, was a Saturday, which is consistent
	with the majority of dates provided for other dates of livraison publication.</li></ul>

<li>**** Dickinson (2001) explains 1836 instead of the conventional 1835:<br />
'Mees (1994) reported that an "Avis accompagnant la 97e livraison" was present in the 
copy of the "Planches colori&eacute;es" in Leiden and that this carries the date April 1836. 
It follows that the dates for livraisons 98 and 99 must also date from 1836, 
presumably from after April, and thus from December 31. The birds described 
by Temminck in the texts for these three livraisons, most of them Asian but including 
three from New Guinea and one from Africa, ... should now be dated from 1836 in place of 1835.'</li>

<pre>"When a date is established by a letter of acknowledgement it is necessarily
later than the actual distribution of the part. Where therefore, the dates of
publication were frequently earlier than those here given, they were certainly
never later." (p.vii).</pre>
<li>I am not certain if the listing is designating a difference between "Acknowledged by....", 
"Receipt acknowledged by ..." and "Recieved", but I strongly suspect that there is.  I speculate 
that differing kinds of evidence exist: some from receipt logs, some from notifications of receipt mailed
back to the orginating source, and some from other kinds of indicaitons. My suspicion is that "Receipt 
acknowledged" may be mailed notifications sent back to the originating source, and that these may
well have the longest potential lag time between their dates and the actual dates of publication.
Not knowing what means what, I retain the distinction in my listing below.</li>

<li>Additional notes: In 1994 Ms Robin Sinn, then Public Services Librarian at the Academy worked on
identifying the history of the publication.
Her notes to me indicate several interesting possibilities:<ol>
<li>Vol.69, imprint date 1917 (section including <i>Lepidopyga lillae</i>Stone, p.204) was 
mailed "2/27/18". However, Colin Jone notes (<i>in litt.</i> 2008.07.06) that they have certified dates of mailing to members
and it notes that this page was mailed out 8 Aug. 1917.</li>
<li>Vol.81 (imprint date -- 1929) The Richmond Index (<i>Halcyon albiventris prentissgrayi</i> dates p.627 to Feb. 18, 1930</li>
<li>Vol.83 (imprint date -- 1931) "pub. date for entire volume 1932" (but see below)</li>
<li>Vol.84 (imprint date -- 1932) "pub. date for entire volume 1933"</li>
<li>Vol.85 (imprint date -- 1933) "pub. date for entire volume 1934"</li>
<li>Vol.87 (imprint date -- 1935) "pub. date for entire volume 1936"</li>
<li>Vol.91 (imprint date -- 1939) "pub. date for entire volume 1940"</li>
<li>Vol.97 (imprint date -- 1945) "pub. date for entire volume 1945" (i.e. the same)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Regarding the dates for Vol.83, the evidence suggests that up through p.453
or p.454 this volume was published in 1931, with the remaining portion published in
1932; it appears that p.455 was published in 1932. The evidence (so far 2007.01.28)
is this :<ol>
	<li>The Richmond Index dates <i>Bradyornis herero</i> Meyer de Schauensee "Dec.
	14, 1931" </li>
	<li>The Type list of the ANSP also lists this to 1931. However the consistency
	of the Type list suggests that it can not be relied upon fully in such matters.
	The Type list, for example gives:<ol>
	<li>For <i>Sicalis citrina occidentalis</i> Carriker p.467 a date of 1931 but
	the
	volume number is in error listing it as <b>87</b> when it is actually
	<b>83</b>r, and the date should be 1932.</li>

	<li>For <i> Microrhopias quixensis albicauda</i> Carriker p.465, it gives the
	correct volume number, but a date of 1931, and the date apparently should be
	1932.</li>
	<li>For thirteen taxa from p.455 on in this volume the Type list gives a date of
	1932.</li></ol>
	<li>The Richmond Index gives a date of Jan. 21, 1932 for the taxa from p.455
	on.</li>
	<li>The Peters Checklist series gives an inconsistent selection of 1931 and 1932
	dates for this volume.</li>
	<li>Certainly the source <b>most</b> likely to be correct in dating matters is
	the Richmond Index.</li>
	</ol>

	At least one volume (VI) crosses years.
	Ser. 1 Vol. VI Pt II Sept. 12, 1881 p.180 {<i>Nasiterna Finschii</i> Ramsay}
	Ser. 1 Vol. VI Pt IV Mrch. 20, 1882 p.843 {<i>Eurostopodus nigripennis</i> Ramsay}
	]

	[Discussed by Mathews, (under Ramsay), but Mathews discusses only Australian taxa,
	and perhaps for this reason, no discussion of dates of publication is presented.
	Thus it appears for the first 3 vols. of the first series, anyway, that Mathews
	accepts the imprint date.]

	[Note that Peters <b>1</b>:332 appears to make a bit of muddle of the citation
	for <i>Astur pulchellus</i> (now <i>Accipiter novaehollandiae pulchellus</i>).
	Peters attributes this to "<cite>Journ. Linn. Soc. London <b>16</b> p.131</cite>"
	and gives the date as 1881. 
	CWR gives <cite>Trans. Linn. Soc. (London) Zool. vol.16 no.90 Jan. 26, 1882, p.131.</cite>
	CWR indicates that this is a new name for 
	"Astur soloensis <u>Ramsay</u> (<i><u>nec</u></i> <u>Latham</u>),
	P.L.S.of N.S.W. iv. pt.1 p.66" [for which I have not found a separate card in the cardex].

	A somewhat complicated relation exists among the "Proceedings" the "Transactions", and the 
	"Journal of the Proceedings" and I can not completely rule out the possibility
	of the Peters citation having some validity, but by far the greatest likelihood 
	is that the Richmond Cardex is correct.]

	The Prodeedings issued (in 1929) an Index to the Proceedings 
	(1875-1925)	which resolves many of the date uncertainties. In summary 
	it appears that the dates in the Richmond Index comport with those
	listed in the Index from the Society. Dates for this serial, as listed in
	Peters Checklist should not be trusted.

	A complex and not fully resolvable structure of publication.
	The volumes are comprised of both "numbers" (no.) and Facsciles.
	Evidently articles sometimes extend across fascicles, so the date 
	of publication for a given fascicle may not pertain to the WHOLE fascicle.

 Data are taken from: <ol>
	<li> The Richmond Index 
	-- by all indications the most accurate and dependable source. Of note, in an 
	unpublished letter from CWR to Witmer Stone (1930.07.07) he notes that his
	dates for this serial come from "carefully going over the Registrar's transportation 
	books in which were given the the dates of receipt of the various signatures from the 
	Government Printing Office, ... " </li>
	<li> Harris. 1928. The Condor <b>XXX</b>:4-118. "Robert Ridgway". 
	--an excellent source which appears to largely agree with The Richmond Index.</li>
	<li> Foster, LS. 1892. Bulletin of the Unites States National Museum No.40
		IV. "The Published writings of George Newbold Lawrence, 1844-1891."
	-- Full of inconsistencies and errors. I have not found it trustworthy for dates.</li>

	<li> Crombie, RI. 1994. "Herpetological Publications of the National Museum 
		of Natural History (USNM), 1853-1994" 
		Smithsonian Herpetological Information Service No. 101
	</li>

	<li>CW Richmond's annotations bound into the front of several of the copies 
	of the Bound volumes of Bird Papers from this serial that are in 
	the library of the Bird Division of the U.S.National Museum. 
	This material exists in two forms: there are handwritten listings 
	on very thin tracing type paper (in CWR's hand) and these 
	have been transcribed as typewritten lists.
	The volume numbers of the listings do not exactly match 
	the volumes as they are bound, and as the compilation
	consists only of the bird papers it is not possible to 
	determine (from this material alone) the limits of the
	volumes.
	These listings include the signature number, the page numbers,
	the Date of delivery to the U.S. Nat. Museum, and the stereotype date.
	The listings cover 
	1878.03.27-1879.05.26
	1880.03.27-1881.05.09
	1882.06.14-1883.07.06
	1885.07.08-1885.05.18
	It is not clear if there are gaps in the coverage, and I suspect
	that there are, and that some listings may still exist
	but be bound in other copies of the Proceedings -- 
	quite possibly somewhere else in the Bird Division or
	elsewhere at the National Museum.</li>

	P<small>ROCEEDINGS OF THE</small> U.S. N<small>ATIONAL</small> M<small>USEUM</small>.

	In imitation of those learned societies which publish 
	periodically descriptions of new species, &amp;c., 
	in the form of proceedings of weekly or monthly meetings, 
	and thus present to the world the discoveries connected 
	with the establishment at the earliest practical moment, 
	it appeared to be very desirable that the National Museum 
	should have some medium of prompt publication for announcing 
	descriptions of specimens received, (many of which are new species,) 
	by correspondents of the Institution.  To meet this want a fifth series 
	of publications, (octavo) entitled "Proceedings of the National Museum" 
	was commenced in 1880.  They are printed in successive 
	signatures as fast as material sufficient for 16 pages is 
	prepared and distributed at once to scientific societies 
	and leading active working naturalists in this country and in Europe,* 
	each signature having printed at the bottom of its first page the date 
	of actual issue, for settling any questions as to the priority 
	of publication.  Of this series, four volumes have been published, 
	comprising 2,221 pages with 28 cuts and 19 plates.

...

	In the year 1862 the plan of stereotyping every article printed by the 
	Institution was adopted, the plates being carefully preserved, thus making 
	it practicable at any time to issue new editions except where expensive 
	lithographic plates were used, a limited number, only of impressions 
	from these having been taken.  
	...
	The printing of the Bulletins and Proceedings is authorized by the 
	Department of the Interior and paid out of its fund.  
	An edition of 1,000 copies is published of which one-half 
	is distributed by the Department of the Interior and 
	one-half by the Institution.  As the pages are stereotyped, 
	the cost of additional copies is slight; and for the 
	purpose of making sure that a sufficient number of sets 
	will be accessible forever

	to students in all parts of the world, it has been considered 
	expedient to print 1,500 additional copies of each for 
	incorporation in the miscellaneous collections.

	It is not clear how long this scheme of signature dating and stereotyping lasted.

 Crombie (p.2) makes the following important points:

	Regarding the dates of signatures and nos.<pre>

	 "It was difficult to establish dates for earlier papers and in
	some cases it was not possible. The earliest volumes of the
	<b>Proceedings</b> were published by "signatures" of varying numbers of
	pages. [<small>Footnote, USNM Bull. (93):39. Proceedings papers Nos. 1-760 [vol. 1-11] 
		were issued by signatures, and when the published date for a
		signature differs from the date it was received from the
		printer at the National Museum, the latter date has been used
		here as the actual date of publication.  After No.760 each
		article has its actual date of publication recorded in the
		completed volume of Proceedings.</small>] Often the end of a
	given signature did not coincide with the end of a paper, so
	portions of one paper may have appeared several months later. In
	these cases I [Crombie] have attempted to give inclusive dates for
	the entire paper, although the annotations for some
	signatures are very confusing."<pre>

	Regarding the relation between imprint dates and publication dates:</pre>

		"At the back of the table of contents in <b>Proceedings</b> volumes
	9-11, there is an explanation that the articles were "stereotyped" on the
	date at the bottom of the signature page but that the actual date of publication
	for each signature is given in the front of the volume. In these cases both the
	"stereotyped" date and the later "published" date are given, with the latter
	assumed to be the correct date of publication. Unfortunately, there is no indication
	if the same situation obtained with volumes 1-8, and a search of the records in the
	Smithsonian Archives and Press did not clarify the problem.  Consequently, the 
	signature dates are regarded as publication dates for volumes 1-8; it should be 
	emphasized that some doubt exists and that additional data in the future could 
	modify these dates."<pre>

	It appears to me [APP] that data from the Richmond Index and from his
	listing of dates of receipt and stereotype dates that modifications
	of some of these dates is necessary. In addition it appears from 
	Richmond's data (which was unknown to Crombie) that the relationship 
	between stereotyped date and date of availability suggests that 
	<i>contra</i> to Crombie's approach, the stereotyped date can not 
	be regarded as the "published" date for the early volumes.

	Additionally I note that the pagination scheme employed changes.
	Initially pagination was by volume.
	Commencing with Volume 60 each article was given an article number
	and paginated individually. Each article was still given a "No."
	which was cumulative from the first No. of Vol.1.
	The change in pagination commences with Vol.60 no.2396
	With volume 83 in 1937, the scheme reverted to through pagination
	of each volume.

	Psovaia ochota =  chase or hunt.
	Ruzheinaia = rifle shooting.
	CWR's translation "Hunting and Shooting" is understandable.
	Don Cunningham notes an association with dogs, (esp. Borzoi's) and
	suggests "Hunting with Gun and Dog" as a possible translation.
