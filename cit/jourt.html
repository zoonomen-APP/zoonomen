	1830-1831

		Evidently much uncertainty remains concerning the
		publications dates of the different livraisons of this
		work.  The uncertainty seems focused on livr.5 and
		livr.6.  I find most citations for livr.5 as 1830,
		except for GENUS Merulaxis, and species Merulaxis ater,
		which occur ar the end to livr.5.  These are given as
		1831.  Richmond says in livr.5, under <i>M. ater</i>, that
		Lesson cites <u>Centurie Zoologique</u>  pl.30 as the
		original citation for <b>Merulaxis</b>.  The publication date
		of that plate { <u>Centurie Zoologique</u> livr.IV p.88 pl.
		30 } is given as 1831.  This suggests that portions (at
		least) of livr.5 of the current work were published in
		1831. 
		[ I interpreted the break to be between p.392 (1830) and p.397 (1831)]

		Mathews (Birds of Australia, Bibliography p.80) 
		gives dates by Bibl. de France:
		Livr. 1	pp.1-80			Fb 13, 1830
		livr. 2	pp.81-160	30 pl.	My 08, 1830
		livr. 3	pp.161-240	15 pl.	Jy 10, 1830
		livr. 4	pp.241-320	15 pl.	Sp 25, 1830
		livr. 5	pp.321-400	15 pl.	De 01, 1830 "about"
		livr. 6	pp.401-480	15 pl.	Fe 01, 1831 "about"
		livr. 7	pp.481-560	15 pl.	Ap 09, 1831
		livr. 8	pp.561-end	15 pl.	Jn 11, 1831

		This would appear to place all of livr.5 in 1830.
		Murray Bruce has studied this matter, and provides considerable 
		additional understanding. I include a copy of the portion of his
		communication detailing this (rec'd 2002.03.15):</pre>
		<ul>
		<li>"<b>Lesson</b>:  ... , this is another case needing study in more detail.  
		Mathews used the 'Bibl. de France' as a reliable source for resolving a number of issues of dates, 
		when compared to notices in contemporary journals.  He first published his findings on Lesson's 'Trait&eacute;é' 
		in 1911, but was unable to provide details for livr.5.  Zimmer's 'Catalogue' (1926) cited this and noted 
		that if livr.5 was uncertain, then this could make the subsequent livraisons uncertain (and noted that 
		the preface was dated November 1830).  Mathews updated his findings in 1925 with details for livr.5, 
		but obviously this was not available to Zimmer.  As Zimmer's work was more influential later, this added 
		to the confusion.  In the 'Catalogue of the Birds of the Americas', another influential work, Hellmayr, 
		in the first volume he published in 1924, dated <b>Merulaxis</b> (p.397) and <i>Muscicapa delalandi</i> (p.392) 
		as 'end of 1830'.  In a footnote on p.34 he indicated that it had to be earlier than 1 March 1831, 
		the date for livr.6, and must have been in late 1830 (1 March for livr.6 followed Mathews 1911, 
		although Mathews later amended this to 'about 1 February').  Hellmayr also added to the confusion by using 
		1831 for livr.5 later (see his vol. on Tyrannidae from 1927).<p>

		Where the Peters volumes covered Neotropical birds studied by Hellmayr, he was accepted as a reliable source.  
		As a result, Peters omitted names synonymised by Hellmayr, even if they post-dated Sharpe's 'Handlist', 
		contrary to Peters's policy for other regions.  However, for livr.5 Peters himself was more cautious than 
		Hellmayr and noted the ref. as late 1830 or early 1831, but this may have been because Hellmayr dated livr.5 
		names as either 1830 or 1831, with 1831 apparently preferred later.  Mathews himself accepted livr.5 as 1830 
		and used this later (e.g. in his 'Systema Avium Australasianarum', 1927-1930).<p>

		This confusion is reflected in how livr.5 names have been cited in Peters volumes.  
		I have a copy of the Lesson publication and went through livr.5, i.e. pp.321-400, to sample how they were 
		handled in Peters, with the following result (an asterisk means only the page mentioned, i.e. 
		no indication of 'livr.5'):<pre>

	</pre>

	Another demonstration of the inconsistencies to be found in Peters volumes.  In this case, as noted, 
	the confusion can be traced to Zimmer and Hellmayr in particular.  Peters himself was cautious, which is 
	understandable considering that Hellmayr was inconsistent and Zimmer was tentative based on incomplete evidence.  
	Mathews was consistent once he established a date for livr.5, as noted.</p> 

	The citing of pl.30 from 'Cent. Zool.' (1831) under <b>Merulaxis</b> is irrelevant.  
	As Mathews had pointed out, Lesson himself was one of the reviewers of recent publications in contemporary journals 
	and dates from the 'Bibl. de France' demonstrated that Lesson was noticing his own works in advance of publication.  
	Moreover, one should bear in mind that in the early 1830s Lesson was working on at least six publications 
	simultaneously, all appearing in parts and all being publicised by him as well as others.  One can find 
	other examples of birds described in one place and illustrated in another, although both were being published 
	around the same time.<p>

	All things considered, I accept the dates of publication of the livraisons as established by Mathews in 1925 
	(as quoted from the Zoonomen website).  As indicated above, the confusion can be traced through Peters to Zimmer 
	and Hellmayr.  Therefore my conclusion is for HBW to accept 1830 as the date for all names cited from livr.5.  
	Thus 1831 only applies to names published after p.400."</li>

	<li>Edward Dickinson has pursued this further, especially investigating the weight and value
	of the evidence provided by the Bibliography de France. Edward's work would appear to increase 
	the uncertainty with regard to the possibility of livr.5 being published in 1830. His judgment, 
	with which I agree, is that under the current Code the livraison 5 should be dated to 1831.<p>
	Edward's letter (2004.11.22) is as follows:<pre>

	The Bibliographie de France was a weekly publication produced by the printing trade. 
	Within each weekly issue the bulk of the content concerns new French books 
	(including livraisons of part works); there are other shorter sections that include 
	English and German books, but I spent no time looking at those, 
	and there are further sections dealing with certain kinds of other print. 
	The normal issue was 16 or 24 pp.  

	The information relative to Lesson's Trait&eacute;, that was obviously found by Mathews (and Sherborn) 
	can be documented clearly for others to find and is as follows:
 
In <big>1830</big>:
 
    in issue 7 dated 13 Feb. [pp. 97-112] on p.107: No.910 records the first livraison, 
    made up of 5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp.]
 
    in issue 19 dated 8 May [pp. 289-304] on p. 298: No.2538 records the second livraiosn, 
    made up of 5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates, 
    and a further 15 plates from the first livraison.
 
    in issue 28 dated 10 July [pp. 457-480] on p. 473: No.3932 records the third livraison, 
    made up of 5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates
 
    in issue 39 dated 25 Sept. [pp. 633-648] on p. 644: No.5177 records the fourth livraison, 
    5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates
 
    The index for the year lists only these four entries for this publication.
 
    I checked every issue from No.40 to the year end to see if the Trait&eacute; appeared 
    (without having made the index); it did not. 
    This is not hard to check as the titles are arranged roughly in alphabetical order 
    in section I of each issue.
 
In <big>1831</big>:
 
   in issue 10 dated 6 March [pp. 137-152] on p. 147: No.1100 records the sixth livraison, 
   5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates
 
   in issue 15 dated 9 April [pp. 201-216] on p. 213: No.1635 records the seventh livraison, 
   5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates
 
   in issue 24 dated 11 June [pp. 337-352] on p. 347: No.2732 records the eighth livraison, 
   5 sheets of octavo [thus 80 pp] plus 15 plates
 
  The index for the year records just these three entries for this publication.
 
  I checked every issue from No.1 to No.9 to see if the Trait&eacute; appeared 
  (without having made the index); it did not.
 
  I did not search the 1832 volume for the last part. 
  The idea that there is a 'last' part is based on the fact that 8 x 80 = 640 
  and there are 659 pages in the finished work 
  (not counting the introductory pages to the text volume and to the separate volume of plates). 
  Note however that Lowe (1925, Ibis, p.483) thought, or assumed, that p. 650 was part of 
  livraison 8 (and thus implied that this livraison was not limited to 80 pages, 
  although I suspect he probably didn't even count). 
  Zimmer noted this and also that the plate count total seemed to exceed by one the number of 
  plates issued.
 
  Note that Zimmer thought (and perhaps Mathews said) that these dates were 'dates of receipt'; 
  they are not, they are the dates of the weekly publication. They may or may not be reporting 
  a mandatory donation during the previous week to some central library (as happens in the UK), 
  but they are certainly not dates of receipt.

  [APP note: Mathews <strong>does</strong> appear to regard them as dates of receipt, his wording
  on p.80 of the Bibliography of The Birds of Australia is "This was published in
  eight livraisons, the receipt and contents of which are acknowledged in the Bibl. de France as
  follow: ..."]
 
  I also examined the text of Mathews (1925) and I conclude that Mathews, 
  who refers ONLY to the Bibliographie de France had found nothing new and 
  was still guessing as to the date of the fifth livraison. 
  Nor is it obvious from the cadence of publication that November 1830 would be right. 
  Issue 7 was only 5 weeks behind issue 6; had that, in turn, been 5 weeks earlier it 
  would have appeared in the last week of January. Actually it would seem that Mathews 
  did not even find the data from issue 10 in 1831 as he was still unsure about livraison 6.
 
  In the circumstances I revert to my previous view that due to lack of proof for 1830 
  Livraison 5 must be treated as 1831.</pre>

	[Note that Peters <b>1</b>:332 appears to make a bit of muddle of the citation
	for <i>Astur pulchellus</i> (now <i>Accipiter novaehollandiae pulchellus</i>).
	Peters attributes this to "<cite>Journ. Linn. Soc. London <b>16</b> p.131</cite>"
	and gives the date as 1881. 
	CWR gives <cite>Trans. Linn. Soc. (London) Zool. vol.16 no.90 Jan. 26, 1882, p.131.</cite>
	CWR indicates that this is a new name for 
	"Astur soloensis <u>Ramsay</u> (<i><u>nec</u></i> <u>Latham</u>),
	P.L.S.of N.S.W. iv. pt.1 p.66" [for which I have not found a separate card in the cardex].

	A somewhat complicated relation exists among the "Proceedings" the "Transactions", and the 
	"Journal of the Proceedings" and I can not completely rule out the possibility
	of the Peters citation having some validity, but by far the greatest likelihood 
	is that the Richmond Cardex is correct.]
