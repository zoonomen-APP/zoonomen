<ul>
	<li>[APP: The CWR unpublished notes on Dates of Publication indicates that "errors in 
	Sherborn and Allen are corrected by Osgood" <cite>Osgood. Proc.Biol.Soc.Wash. <b>XXVII</b>.
	1914:1-2</cite>.]

	<li>Osgood's article (dealing with dates for <i>Ovis canadensis</i>, <i>Ovis cervina</i> and
	<i>Ovis montana</i>) argues that the material in Nat.Misc. was issued with a great deal of regularity
	and he feels that the dates of plates can be determined with a great deal of certainty.
	The evidence in support of this includes:<pre>
	"the original prospectus, the admitted regularity of the first thirteen volumes, 
	the fact that the scattered dates of the later volumes occur on the parts that 
	would in regular course have been issued on those dates,* the fact that such 
	scattered dates occur even in the next to the last volume practically at the 
	end of the series,&dagger; and the correspondence of the issue of the last part 
	with the date of Doctor Shaw's death which occurred on July 22, 1813."<p>

	"* In the very few cases where there is not absolute agreement, the date
	on the plate is always earlier, never later, than the contingent date of issue.<p>

	&dagger; This evidently escaped Doctor Allen, possibly  on account of imperfection
	in the copy of the work examined by him.  In the Field Museum copy and the
	Library of Congress copy, Plate 1004 of Vol. XXIII is dated 1812. In this 
	connection, it may be stated that these copies directly diasagree with Doctor
	Allen's statements in the following particulars: Vol. II, Pls. 44, 62, 69, and 
	72 are dated; Volume III, Pl. 78 is dated; Vol. IV, Pl. 124 is dated; Vol. V, 
	Pl. 152 is not dated; Vol. XXIII, Pl. 1004 is dated."</pre>

					is the last plate for 1791, the first of several of his demonstrable errors in this piece.
					This would imply that plates 88, and 89 should date to 1792, however Sherborn himself
					dates these two taxa (<i>Xiphias platypterus</i> and <i>Lacerta unistriata</i>) to
					179<b>2</b> in his <i>Index Animalium</i> (pp.759,1019 of his 1902 volume).

					<li>While Sherborn felt free to ingnore his Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist. compilation of dates,

	The most complete discussion of this work known to me is:
	A Bibliography of British Lepidoptera
	1608-1799.
	Arthur A. Lisney
	The Chiswick Press
	London
	1960
	(Privately printed)

	There are a significant number of disagreements between Lisney's collation, and
	the tabular representation by Sherborn. Unfortunately, a listing showing which plates have
	which dates has not been published. This would substantially increase the 
	certainty with regard to a number of the dates at issue.
	Sherborn's dates appear to be those that have been followed by many of the 
	more careful workers (many dates alternatively are listed that simply seem to be repetitions
	of previous errors). It appears that Sherborn's dates may be incorrectly worked out.

	Subsequently, an important and detailed publication undertakes a careful review of the dates of 
	publication for this work.

	"Vivarium naturae or the naturalist's miscellany (1789-1813) by George
	Shaw: an assessment of the dating of the parts and volumes"
	Edward C. Dickinson Murray D. Bruce Robert J. Dowsett. 
	Archives of Natural History <b>33</b>:322-343.

	It is worth noting that for avian names this detailed investigation shows that
	the dates determined by Charles W. Richmond, and previously published are all correct.

	<li>Note: Dick Banks has investigated the details of a publication by
	Bonaparte, which is often referred to as "Consp. Psitt." or "Consp.
	Psittacorum".
	Dick's notes on this include:<ul>
	<li><pre>Naumannia (the forerunner of Journal f&uuml;r Ornithologie)
is in the Div.  Birds (USNM) library.  The 1856 volume includes the
index for 1850-1856.  The table of contents lists Beitrage nr. 1a,
Tabellarische Uebersicht der Papagaien by C. L. Bonaparte at page
352. There is nothing else by Bonaparte in the table of contents.  At
page 352 there is what seems to be a report of a society meeting on 5
June 1856 - no mention of Bonaparte. This extends through page 382 and
includes (apparently) papers read at that meeting.  Between pages
382 and 383 there is a hand written note bound in, which says that
Bonaparte's Beilage Nr. 1a "which should occur here, is missing, but
may be found in the copy at L.C. [= Library of Congress} and signed
by C.W.R. [Charles W. Richmond].  The paper starting on p. 383 is the
one listed in the table of contents for that page.</pre></li>
<li>Banks' examination of the Library of Congress copy yields:<pre>

The Table of Contents and the information on pp. 352-382 seem to be the
same as the Birds [Division] copy.  But, between pp. 382 and 383, there is
bound in a 4 sheet (8 unnumbered pages) insert (larger than volume size,
and folded to fit, but tearing along folds) that is headed on the first
(right side) page: 
	Beilage Nr. 1. | Tabellarische Uebersicht | der | PAPAGAIEN. ||
	Von | Sr. Hoheit || Charles-Lucien Prince Bonaparte ||

There is a paragraph of text on that page.

The next two pages are headed, centered on both pages: 

CONSPECTUS PSITTACORUM | ORDO I. PSITTACI | Familia Psittacidae |
Series 1. Americani ||

Below the heading there are eight columns, with groups of them headed by
subfamily names, with numbered genera and numbered species.  Columns 3, 4,
and 5 are headed Subfam. 2.  Conurinae.  The last entry, at the bottom of
col. 5, is  
			20. Pyrilia. Bp. 
		[76.] typica <i>Bp.</i> 
		  (<i>pyrilia, Bp.</i>) 
		[77.] amazonina <i>O. des Murs.</i>
		
	The numbers 76 and 77 are torn off by having been folded.

Columns 6, 7, and 8 are headed Subfam. 3.  Psittaculinae.  In col. 7 is:
			25.  Gypopsitta <i>Bp.</i>
		112.  vulturina <i>Wagl.</i>

Both generic names <b>Pyrilia</b> and <b>Gypopsita</b> have lines drawn to
the left, in ink, probably by Richmond, indicating that they are new names.
It is strange that there are no cards in the Richmond files with these
names and citations.  Note that Bonaparte considered these genera to be in
different subfamilies.

The table occupies 6 pages. The end page is a table of subfamily
distribution by geography.  </li></ul></ul>

	Mees discusses the dates of publication of the early part of this serial.
	(ref.<cite> Mees GF 1973 "Once more: the identity and authorship of 
	<i>Treron griseicauda</i>." BBOC. <b>93</b>(3):119-120.</cite>). 

	He indicates that Schlegel In Ibis 1863 <b>5</b>:119-120 indicates that the
	first nine sheets of this serial were printed around the middle of
	1862, but that "publication of this work can only begin with 1863."
	[APP: exactly what that means is not clear to me]
	That issue of the <i>Ibis</i> contained  a review of Schlegel's paper,
	and an article by Wallace discussing it.  This indicates that
	the Schlegel article was published well before the July <i>Ibis</i>
	but possibly well before Wallaces PZS publication of <i>Treron griseicauda</i>.
	It must be mentioned that Mees' speculation was based in part on
	his belief (based on Duncan 1937) that the issue of PZS in question
	was published in April of 1863.  The Richmond Index indicates that
	that issue of the PZS was published in February, not April. In my view
	the date of the Richmond Index is much more likely to be correct than 
	Duncan's date, and it makes it more likely that Schlegels article could
	have been published in 1863, though I agree 1862 must remain a speculative
	possibility.

 APP Notes:<ul>
	<li>Neave, remarkably makes no mention of Schulze <i>et al.</i> (at least that I can find).
	Schulze <i>et al.</i> were working well before Neave's first volume was completed
	and their project was almost completely published before the first volume of Neave was 
	available. The Nachwort of the final volume of Schulze includes a discussion
	with many references to Neave. (My German is so poor, I can not be confidant of 
	extracting much of what is said).</li>
	<li>It must be remembered, especially when searching the electronic version,
	that one can not count on rigorous consistency in the representation of authors'
	names, or the names of Publication sources: Thus one can find both 
	"Ogilvie Grant" and "Ogilvie-Grant" (<b>1</b>:291,598), as well as "Bull. Orn. Club", 
	"Bull. Brit. Orn. Club", and "Bull. Brit. Orn. Cl." (<b>1</b>:528; <b>3</b>:772,959).
	In the first instance, "Ogilvie Grant" is spelled "Ogilvie-Grant" in the original
	source cited.</li>

	Nomenclatoris zoologici index universalis

	Agassiz, Jean Louis Rodolphe
	1846	
	pp.8+393	Solothurn

</pre>
</pre>
	On examining the copies of Nomenclatoris zoologici index universalis in the
	Herpetology Division of the U.S. National Museum, I found, tipped in a copy of a two-page 
	paper by Donovan and Smith, which I here reproduce.
	<pre>
	The Dates of Publication of Louis Agassiz'
		Nomenclator Zoologicus
	Donovan, R. Bowley and Horbart M. Smith

	Most copies of Agassiz' Nomenclator Zoologicus are bound without
the original covers, and since no other single source gives the dates
of publication of all parts, which are of considerable nomenclatural
importance, we here place on record the information on publication 
dates that has been gleaned from a copy in the Library of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology. This copy was presented by Alexander Agassiz to 
Walter Faxon, who in turn bequeathed it to the Library, in which it was
accessioned October 16, 1934.
	As given to the printed <u>cover</u> of each fascicle, the publication
dates and contents of the separate fascicles are as follows:
	Fasciclus I 	(Mammalia, Echinodermata et Acelephas): <b>1842</b>.
	Fasciclus II 	(Aves): <b>1842</b>.
	Fasciclus III et IV 
		(Crustacea et Vermes, <i>i.e.</i> Entozoa, Turbellaria et Annulata; 
		Hemiptera et Infusoria; Polygastrica et Rotataria): <b>1843</b>.
	Fasciclus V et VI 
		(Neuroptera, Orthoptera, Polypi et Reptilia): <b>1844</b>.
	Fasciclus VII et VIII 
		(Mammalia (addenda), Aves (addenda), Reptilia (addenda),
		Pisces, Crustacea (addenda), Hemiptera (addenda), 
		Orthoptera (addenda), Neuroptera (addenda), Hymenoptera,
		Vermes (addenda), Rotatoria (addenda), Polygastrica (addenda),
		Echinodermata (addenda), Acalephas (addenda), et Polypos (addenda):
		<b>1845</b>.
	Fasciclus IX et X 
		(Titulum et Praefotionem Operis, Mollusca, Lepidoptera, 
		Strepsiptera, Diptera, Myriapoda, Thysanura, Thyusanoptera, 
		Suctoria, Epizoa et Arachnidas): <b>1846</b>.
	Fasciclus XI
		(Coleoptera): <b>1846</b>.
	Fasciclus XII
		(Indicem Universalem): <b>1847</b>.

	Of additional special interest to nomenclature is the indicated date of
publication of the Index Universalis, which has been almost universally accepted
as 1846 in conformance with the date printed on the title page. It is presumed
that the title page was printed with other parts in 1846, but that the Index
actually did not appear until 1847. Carus and Englemann (1861, Bibliotheca
Zoologica: 238), in fact, give the date 1848 for the Index, presumably in error.
	A note is pencilled in on the title page of another copy of the Nomenclator in
MCZ Library, giveing the date of publication of a "fascicle 13" as 1847, but
presumably it refers actually to fascicle 12, and may aid in confirmation of
1847 as the date of publication for the Index.
	Although "Infusoria" appers on the cover of fasciculus III-IV, the name
does not appear on the title page of either fasciculus, nor does material
pertaining to this group appear in either the Nomenclator or the Index Universalis.
	Although "Infusioria" appears on the cover of fasciculus III-IV, the name does
not appear on the title page of either fasciculus, nor does material pertaining
to this group appear in either the Nomenclator or the Index Universalis.
	The Faxon copy is bound with the three parts not regularly present in other
copies: a "Prospectus" for the work, a "Lecori Benevolo", and author-publisher
notes. None of these parts, for example, is present in the other two copies in the 
Museum Library, and only one of them (the "Lectori Benevolo") is bound with the 
copy in the University of Illinois Library.
	An interleaved annotated copy of the Nomenclator, bound in four volumes, from
Agassiz' personal library, now exists in the Rare Book Room of the Library of the
Museum of Comparative Zoology.

These dates suggest a substantial number of taxa may need alterations of date.

My examination of the set at the Library of the National Museum of Natural History 
shows the following:
<li>The Fascicules are stamped with apparent acquisition dates (from early in the
20<sup>th</sup> century, and the volumes are stamped with what I interpret to possibly
be binding dates (from late in the 20<sup>th</th></sup> century).

Then covers, when bound in the back of the volume, have pasted on
an oblong of paper, which I presume to be the label from the
wrapper of the Fascicule. It contains the Tome and Fascicule number
and the list of articles from the Memoire and Bulletin (if present).
The later examples have handwritten indications of the pagination
and plate numbers included.

		Of interest at the foot of p.64, the Smithsonian copy has a date stamp in blue
		ink that reads "Dec. 17, 1868" In discussing this with Leslie Overstreet

		[Note APP: From the material examined so far, I am unable 
		to be certain of the publishing history for this serial. 
		One guess is that the pattern may be reflected in the bound 
		volume 5 (1869). If this is so, then it suggests that parts 
		of the Bulletin sometimes were published with Fascicules (and 
		sometimes not). This possibility would appear to be strongly
		supported by the lack of any "Bulletin" covers bound with 
		the volumes.  Certainly articles often continued across 
		Fascicules, and it appears that the Bulletin articles may 
		well have as well.  The timing and organization of the plate 
		publishing is uncertain.] 

Tome Sixi&egrave;me: 1870

	[Note APP: The Fascicule covers have written in ink
	the pp. and pl. components, and (starting with F. 2)
	the Smithsonian Accession Date]

	Premier Fascicule: pp.1-56 pl.3-789

		[Note APP: Smithsonian Copy has a blue ink stamp "Aug 5 1874"
		at foot of p.72. Thus highly likely that this is the end
		of the Fascicule 1 (though not otherwise determinable by the
		structure and data of the volume to hand.]
		[Note APP: Smithsonian copies with covers bound in back have an
		oblong of paper pasted on to the cover. I interpret this to be
		the contents data taken from the wrapper. This interpretation 
		is supported, in this instance, by the pencil script
		"<big>1</big><sup><u>er</u></sup> <big><u>F</u></big>".

	(the component listed above) is uncertain. It appears that the

	Successor journal to <u><i>Commentarii</i></u>.
	Published in 21 vols. from 1747 to 1778.
	By 1750 political chaos had casued significant publication lags in the <i>Commentarii</i>
	which was by then 10 years behind authorship.
	Articles written over the course of six years were bound into the two final volumes
	of the <i>Commentarii</i> (13 &amp; 14), and then publication passed to the <i>Novi Commentarii</i>.

	Of interest, Euler published extensively in the <i>Novi Commentarii</i> publishing 179 articles
	between 1750 and 1776.

	Series appears to have been issued quarterly and appears to follow a 1 vol./yr sequence.
	This was apparently maintained from vol. <b>1</b> (1894) through vol. <b>17</b> (1910) 
	Vol. <b>18</b> is published in 1911, but no.3 of that series was published Jan. 31, 1912.
	The sequence then appears to return to normal until the latter portion of 
	vol. <b>34</b> (1927) when no.3 was not published until July 31, 1928.
	All subsequent volumes (at least until 1932) appear to have been published one
	year delayed from the one that would be predicted from the original sequence.

Collecting data predominantly from taxa in Sherborn, Neave, and the Richmond Index I have determined
