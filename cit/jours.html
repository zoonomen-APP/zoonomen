user-friendly and valuable website.

It is clear that the publication in which Isert published had a varied, 
if short, history, appearing in the Bielefeld index under three successive titles 
(n° 2 including Isert):

	Dating note:
	Volume "for 1884" is dated inconsistently by most modern workers.The current
	approach to this problem appears to be to simply and unquestioningly use the dates
	published by others, and this seems to occur without knowledge of or concern for
	the obvious inconsistencies that thereby result.

	Peters Checklist dates taxa from Heft 1 of this volume to 1884 and 1885, and despite the
	obvious inconsistency implied thereby, these dates are faithfully reproduced by others.

	The Richmond Index, appears not to have been consulted by any of these workers, but it
	does give an indication that there may be a basis for the confusion and uncertainty.

	The taxa I have checked so far (2007.12.29) all show a date of "1884" with the
	added text "(July or later)".

	I interpret the imprint date to be "1884" (and probably "July 1884")

	<li>The various volumes of Peters Checklist treat the date of vol. <b>70</b> inconsistently,

	<li>I have interpreted this to imply thata while the <b>imprint</b> date is 1874, that
	some evidence was developed argueing that the <b>publication</b> was delayed until 1875.

Additional information is provided by Anita Garnauf which both suggests
some probabilities and also the complexity of the situation.

Most important it seems evident that the material was initially printed as
pre-prints before being included in the published journal.
Her text (2005.01.07) reads: <pre>
Every month (begin or in the middle of the months) the Acadamy had their
meetings, where they decided to accept a manuscript or not. Usually a few
weeks later these ms were printed (=praeprint) and send out to other
institutions, the authors etc. The Academy was very fast in this procedure,
only In December they were not able to print it before mid January. E.g.,
Meyer1874: the meeting of the Academy was held at Dec 3, but the article +
the contents was published at January 7 1875.

	[Interestingly, it has been suggested that James Sligo Jameson was
	the model for Joseph Conrad's character "Mr Kurtz" in "Heart of Darkness".
	This speculation is found in "The British Library writer's lives Joseph Conrad" 
	by Chris Fletcher. The British Library. 1999. There (pp.60-61) Fletcher notes
	that Conrad referred to Mr Kurtz as "an emissary of pity, and science, and progress".
	When Conrad returned from his time as a river boat captain in the Congo, the press was full
	of accounts of the behaviour of members of H.M. Stanley's Pasha relief expedition.
	Jameson, as a member of the expedition "apparently paid six handkerchiefs for the
	privilege of watching and sketching a young girl sacrificed and eaten by cannibals."

	Conrad refers to Kurtz as "presid[ing] at certain midnight dances ending up with 
	unspeakable rites, which ... were offered up to him - do you understand? - 
	to Mr Kurtz himself."

	The possible parallel also seems interesting to me [APP] in that Mrs Jameson edited her
	husband's Story of the Rear Column (her husband who died on the expedition, as Kurtz 
	also dies in Africa), and in Marlow's account in Heart of Darkness 
	he confronts Kurtz's widow, but is unable to
	tell her of the behaviour of her late husband.

	These are clearly speculations, but the timing and the many parallels seem interesting.

		Zimmer (from Cat Lib Br Mus (NH) ) says:
		sigs a &amp; b and all plates  pub. 1828
		all others (sigs. c-gg) appeared in 1833

		I interp.  that all entries listed "fol." is equvalent to "sig."

		Bob Dowsett writes (2003.06.06):
		[Begin Dowswett 2003.06.06]
		'You will be interested to know that the NHM at Tring has a set of all 20 plates, 
		i.e. including those from the <i>Decas secunda</i>. 
		Alison Harding has most kindly confirmed that they hold the following:

			"1) The first one has a title page which states it is '<i>Decas Prima</i>' 
			and someone has added in pen '<i>et unica!</i>'.  At the bottom of the 
			title page in pen has been added 'Fol. a and b and all plates appeared in 1828, 
			the rest in 1833'.  
			(I do not know who wrote these annotations).  
			This volume has plates 1 to 10 only.

			2) The other copy has no title page but has a handwritten 'title' -
				'<i>Symbolae Physicae seu Icones et Descriptiones corporum Naturalium Novorum 
				aut Minus Cognitorum quae ex itineribus per Libyam Aegyptium Nubiam, Dongalam, 
				Syriam, Arabiam et Haberssiniam publicio instituto sumptu.</i>  
				Hemprich et Ehrenberg.  
				Pars Zooligica I.  
				Berolini ex Ifficina Academica 1828'

				It has all 20 plates"

			She gives me a list of plates XI-XX which corresponds exactly to that supplied by the 
			bookseller. This is presumably where Sclater got his information from, and I am waiting 
			to know whether there are also sets elsewhere (e.g. AMNH, Berlin or Stuttgart). 
			If it is agreed (as I think is the case) that this work was indeed distributed 
			(despite the booksellers' claim to the contrary) then we have earlier descriptions 
			for two Afrotropical taxa: 
				<i>Centropus superciliosus</i> (pl. XI) 
				<i>Estrilda rufibarba</i> (pl. XIII).
			In neither case do the names change, but the authors become:
				Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg (1829) rather than Hemprich &amp; Ehrenberg (1833), and 
				Cabanis (1850) respectively.
		[End Dowsett 2003.06.06]

	Regarding the posited date of 1829, <i>contra</i> 1828, Dowsett's thinking as of 2003.06.07 is:
	[Begin part of Dowsett 2003.06.07]

			'The two people to have used this reference for <i>Centropus superciliosus</i> 
			gave different years: 
				<b>1828</b> in W.L. Sclater's <i>Syst. Av.</i>, and 
				<b>1833</b> in Chapin's <i>Bds of the Belgian Congo</i>. 

				1829 is the date on the copy Steven's bookseller has on hand. 
				That copy is clearly <i>Decas secunda</i>, whereas one notes the title of the 
				NHM volume containing the full set of 20 plates is somewhat different. 
				Had XI-XX been distributed in 1828 (as were the first 10 plates) then one might 
				have thought people aware of the first 10 would know of the 2<sup>nd</sup> batch 
				(which clearly most people didn't). 
				So I think the choice is between a "certain" <b>1829</b> and a less so <b>1828</b>, 
				and I would go for the later date. What do others think?

			As for the different titles, the NHM copy being handwritten I don't think we can be 
			sure it is what covered the plates when distributed, rather than one [that] someone took 
			to be the composite title of the whole work.'
		[End Dowsett 2003.06.07]


		Steven Gregory is currently the primary investigator of this mystery and his explanations
		are:
		[Begin S.G. 2003.06.08.001]
		"Bob appears to have introduced you to this particular loop without
	explaining the background. Edward and I had a 'lively' discussion concerning
	the correct authorship of the new names introduced by the <i>Symbolae Physicae</i>.
	I argued that Zimmer was correct in stating that '...all of which must be
	credited to Ehrenberg although most of them are initialled "<i>H. et E.</i>" in the
	text.' It turns out that all those initialled "E." alone are named
	'<i>hemprichi</i>'. As well as the obvious fact of Hemprich's death in 1825 there
	are some more subtle clues such as: 

	1). The portion of the title page dealing with authorship translates as 
	'establishing publication at the expense [<i>publico institutis sumptu</i>] of 
	F.G.Hemprich &amp; C.G.Ehrenberg', but that it was 'magnificently and expensively published 
	by the surviving [<i>superstes</i>] Dr. C.G.Ehrenberg'. And 

	2). The names are introduced exclusively as footnotes, supporting my contention that 
	while Hemprich will have made extensive field notes later to be incorporated into the text, 
	he was unlikely to have named species 'on the spot' (there were 34,000 zoological
	specimens collected!) and that the names, therefore, were inserted by
	Ehrenberg prior to publication, and cited Art. 50.1 and Recommendation 50A
	of the ICZN in support. 
	
	This is a condensation of a far larger
	correspondence between just the two of us, the upshot of which is that we
	appear to agree to differ on this subject, he is happy with H. &amp; E. in E.,
	and I with E. in H. &amp; E. !!!
	It was at this point, after a lot of digging around into this subject, that
	I found that W.L.Sclater cited 'fol. R, pl. xi,' for <i>Centropus superciliosus</i>, 
	a plate which should not exist, and discovered a set of
	plates for sale by Antiquariaat Melchior purporting to be the Decas Secunda,
	plates XI-XX.

	I attach here the e-mail concerning the names of these plates, and will
	continue with an e-mail attaching scans of the two most interesting plates.

	Each plates has in top left the text: "Zoologica I. Aves" and in top right the plate number. 
	On bottom right is the artist name (usually F. Burde), 
	sometimes on bottom left the engravers name.

[Begin S.G. 2003.06.08.002]
 From available evidence so far a rough chronology would be:

  1820-25	Expedition to North Africa and the Middle East

  1825		Death of F.W.Hemprich in the field from malaria (no day or month
			found), return of C.G.Ehrenberg with 34,000 zoological specimens.

  1828		Start of publication of Symbolae Physicae (1828-1845 et supra)
    			Title
    			Subtitle
    			Text folios a and b (4 ll. or 8 pp).
    			Plates I-X (birds)

  1829		Plates XI-XX (birds)

  1833		Text half-folios <i>c-i</i>, <i>k-u</i>, <i>x-z</i> and <i>aa-gg</i> (28 <i>ll</i> or 56 pp).

 The non-ornithological part of the work continued from this point. 
 Although referred to variously as 'signatures' and 'folios', strictly speaking the
 first two parts (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) are superroyal folios, that is superroyal sheets
 folded once, and the latter parts (<i>c-gg</i>) superroyal half-folios, that is
 single leaves of the same size.
 
 I must say that it seems entirely plausible that texts were released between
 1829 and 1833, and not 'all at once' as the bibliographers have it, but that
 this is probably now beyond any investigation unless a library somewhere has
 retained proof of receipt. Bob Dowsett has taken up the running in this area
 as he was the most enthused by my 'discovery'. As well as at the NHM, I believe 
 a complete set resides in Berlin, although I'm unsure which institution as the 
 internet description merely states 'Zoological Library',

[End S.G. 2003.06.08.002]

	Hemprich died in the field during their labors, 
	Zimmer in attributed all taxa to Ehrenberg. 
	I have interpreted ICZN 50.1 (1999) to indicate that both authors should

	Notes:
		This rare work was discussed by CWR in a letter to Witmer Stone (1904.06.10).
		Richmond Indicates that after Sherborn had long insisted that there was no
		"bird part" he eventually found it in Alfred Newton's library.
		The first volume (containing material relating to mammals) was issued in 
		12<sup>mo</sup> in 1827. Though many copies of that volume are apparently dated
		1828, implying the presence of two issues of it.
		The second volume (with the bird material) has two title pages, one with the
		author's name and a general title, but lacking a date, the second title page has
		a title and indicates the volume and part, but lacks the author's name. 

		Billberg introduced a large number of generic names, many of which were senior 
		to those already in wide use in the early 20<sup>th</sup> cent.

<!-- 
	This portion of the BBOC <b>XL</b> no.<b>CCXLV</b> was published December 8, 1919.</li>
	<li>There are three main possibilities:<ol>
		<li>The Corrigenda was issued on Nov. 7, 1919 with foreknowledge of not only
		what would be published in the upcoming issue of the BBOC, but knowledge
		(more than a month prior) to the exact date of publication of this 
		long-delayed number. This seems extremely unlikely, and I know of no data
		to support this possibility.</li>
		<li>The Corrigenda was issued separately <b>after</b> Part <b>II</b> as an
		unnumberd and undated sheet -- essentially a "part" and work unto itself.
		(to date there is no evidence to support this).
		<li> Part <b>II</b> was delayed to some time after the date specified 
		(Nov. 7, 1919, a Friday). This last possibility is supported by evidence
		within the publication itself.</li>	

	</ol>
	<li>If we accept the third scenario (the most likely one, and the only one supported
	by evidence) the question stands: what date should be given to part <b>II</b>?<br>
	The Code indicates that if the date specified (in this instance Nov. 7, 1919) 
	is not correct, then the date to be adopted is the "earliest day on which the work 
	is demonstrated to be in existence as a published work".
	Thanks again to Edward Dickinson, we know that notice of Part <b>II</b> <b>and</b> the
	Corrigenda was given in the Ibis in 1920 (p.505). 
	I do not have the exact date for this issue but it appears to be in the July-Oct. span.</li>
	<li>I expect that this part was undoubtedly published well prior to mid-1920, and expect that
	data may become available that will allow an earlier and more certain date. 
	It is even possible that data may become available that will allow it to be dated to
	1919, but as of yet, such data has not been brought forth.</li>

 Murray Bruce sends this description of the structure and arrangement of the work.(slightly edited).
</pre>
  "I have a copy of Wagler's <b>'Systema Avium'</b> in front of me [...].  
  Wagler's work is unpaginated and consists of a collection of reviews 
  of various genera. It is subtitled <b>'Pars Prima'</b>, 
  but with Wagler's early death, no more were published.<p>

  I think Peters 6:79 shows the conventional way to cite names 
  based on the numbered sequence of species <b>within</b> an individual review. 
  The genera are not numbered so you have to search for the cited species.  
  My copy (as with others I've seen and as Richmond implies) has handwritten 
  page numbers, starting from the beginning of the reviews. <p>

 So:<ul>
  <li><i>culik</i> and <i>reinwardtii</i> appear on page [11] 
  of the first signature group of 16 pp; 
  <li><i>punctuligera</i> appears on p.[27] 
  (the 11th page of the second signature group of 16 pp.)  </ul>

  Sherborn's solution for citing names is a logical one, but requires a search for the cited species 
  Also, he is right to call it 'I', even if no more were published.  

  I think the best way to cite Wagler's names is to follow what Peters does, 
  but to also add a bracketed page number at the end.  
  This is easier to follow than Sherborn and combines Richmond's simple solution 
  with the reality of how Wagler constructed his text."

	[
	Note 1: I remain interested and confused by the orthography of the type locality
	representations with regard to the use of italics.
	In many instances italics seem to be used to describe habitats, as opposed to
	locations.
	e.g. p.205 under Gecko:
	"<i>Habitat in</i> Indiis, <i>frequens etiam in domibus.</i>"
	(trans. "Lives in the Indies, often even in homes.")
	However, contrast p.205 under Stincus:
	"<i>Habitat in montis</i> Lybiae, AEgypti, Arabia <i>petreae.</i>"
	(trans. by Kitchell and Dundee, "A trilogy on the Herpetology of Linnaeus's 
	Systema Natura X" 1994 p.14 
	"Lives in mountainous areas of Libya, Egypt and Arabia Petraea." 
	With a footnote (27, p.37 stating: 
	'Not "Rocky Arabia" as in the translation of the 13th ed. of Syst. Nat. by Wm. Turton, 
	but rather the area of Arabia surrounding Petra. The term is an ancient one.'

	This appears to me that they are suggesting that the italicization of "petreae"
	is a typographic error? I do not find a discussion from them regarding the
	meaning and implication, if any, of the italics.

	In classical Latin 
	<b>petra</b> ~ae <i>f.</i> A rock, boulder, or crag.
	<b>Petra</b> ~ae <i>f.</i> The name of several towns, esp. the chief town
	of Arabia Petraea.

	I expect that Kitchell and Dundee may not have attended to the implications
	of the italiciziation, and lower case used by Linnaeus. Alternatively the
	lower case and italicization may not have been Linnaeus' intent.
	Occam's razor would, I believe, favor "Rocky Arabia" over "Arabia Petraea".

	However, the meaning and consistency of the italiciziation is not clear.
	In the instances of  <i>Testudo carinata</i> p.198 and <i>Testudo serpentina</i> p.199
	The text reads: 
		"<i>Habitat in</i> Calidis <i> regionibus</i>."
		And the only reasonable interpretation is that given by Kitchell and Dundee:
		"Lives in warm regions."
	"Calidis" does not seem to be any PLACE, so by my theory it would seem it should 
	be italicized, and it is not.

	Note 2: The date of Systema Naturae is fixed by the ICZN as 1 January, 1758.
		This may not be far from the actual date it was published. In his
		'Index to the "Systema Natur&aelig;" of Linnaeus.' 1899. 
		C. Davies Sherborn indicates (p.vi):
			"In a letter to Mr. John Ellis, dated 8 Feb., 1758, Linn&aelig;us says the
			first vol. of the 10th ed. of the Systema was just published.  We 
			can therefore safely date Zoological Nomenclature from 1st Jan.,
			1758."

	<li>The use of the dagger (&dagger;) is of interest. I include the explanations from
	Martin Spies, David Nicolson and Dick Petit concerning this mark.</li><ol>
	<li>Martin Spies (2003.04.18):<pre>
	"With this symbol ... Linné denotes that he has not seen the animal 
	in question neither <i>in vivo</i> nor in any museum (but instead has 
	named it only after an older description or figure by another author)." 

	The above is my translation from the German out of: 

	<cite>Nordstroem, F. 1943. 
	Zur Deutung einiger Linnéscher und Clerckscher Schmetterlingsarten. 
	II. Was ist Phalaena Geometra amata L.? 
	Pp. 14-19 in: Malaise, R. (ed.): Folium entomologicum. Festschrift 
	z. 60. Geburtstage von Felix Bryk. - Lund.</cite> 

	At least in the entomological literature, many authors after Linné 
	- for example the founders of dipterology, Meigen, Wiedemann, etc. - 
	have followed the 'master' all the way down to typographical detail, 
	and also used the dagger symbol when discussing species they 
	knew only from literature references.</pre></li>

	<li>David Nicolson (2003.04.18)[from Dan Nicloson]:<pre>
... It appears that Linnaeus used the dagger for different things, 
according to which publication was involved!

Botanists rarely have occasion to use the <i>Systema</i> since we have his 
<i>Species Plantarum</i> (2 editions) as well as his <i>Genera Plantarum</i> and Linnaeus rarely
(but sometimes) used the <i>Systema</i> for new plants species.<ul>
<li>The dagger in his <i>Species Plantarum</i> indicates an imperfectly known species
or some doubt or obscurity.</li> 
<li>The dagger in his <i>Genera Plantarum</i> indicates that he knew the genus only
from herbarium material.</li></ul> 

The same problem (different meaning) exists for the asterisk. [*]<ul>
<li>In the <i>Species Plantarum</i> it indicates that a good description is to be found at the
place cited.</li>
<li>In the <i>Genera Plantarum</i> an asterisk indicates that Linnaeus had
studied living material.</li></ul>
Hence, in the <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, the <b>absence</b> of a dagger and an asterisk
indicates that Linnaeus only knew it from the literature.<p>

This info is to be found in William T. Stearn's magisterial introduction
the 1957 Ray Society's facsimile edition of Linnaeus' <i>Species Plantarum</i> in
his Chapter 18 "Signs Used by Linnaeus" (pp.162-163).</pre>

<li>Dick Petit (2004.01.09)<pre>It is explained by Linnaeus himself on page 613 of the
10th edition of the Systema.  In addition to what it represents, his reason
for using it was to call attention to unseen species "so naturalists may be
stimulated to examine them more closely."
Dance gives a translation taken from Heller, 1964 Huntia <b>1</b>:33-70 
(which I [RP] have not seen).  
He is quoted by Dance as translating Linnaeus' note as:<br> 
"We have everywhere used the sign of the Cross to mark 
animals which we have not seen either in the living state 
or preserved in Museums, that so Naturalists may be 
stimulated to examine them more closely."  
</li></pre>

<li>Linneaus' text on p.613 of the 10<sup>th</sup> appears as follows:<pre>
(&dagger;) Signo <i>Crucis ubique notavimus animalia nobis nec viva, nec in mu&#383;eis a&#383;&#383;ervata
vi&#383;a, ut Natur&aelig; con&#383;ulti ad ea attentius examinanda incitentur.</i>
