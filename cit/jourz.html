	(The) Zoological Journal.
	Conducted by Thomas Bell, John George Children, James de Carle Sowerby,
		and GB Sowerby.
	[From vol. 3 edited by NA Vigors, with the co-operation of 
		Thomas Bell, ET Bennett, JE Bicheno, WJ Broderip, JG Children,
		Thomas Hardwick, T Horsfield, W Kirby, J de Carle Sowerby, W Yarrell]
	1824-1835
	5 vols., 8vo
	Supplement. Nos. 1-6. 1835
	London, W. Phillips.

	This Journal was the result of the splinter group (essentially Quinarian in nature) that broke
	from the Linnean Society. This group progressed as the Zoological Club of London to the
	Zoological Society of London, with its <i>Proceedings</i>.

	vol. 1 as both 1824 and 1825, split between 412 and 466
	Journal definitely started in 1824. (See Soc.Hx. of Nat. Hx.
	Newsletter 51. Jan 1995. Article 11.) But, if and when a 
	break occured is not clear. Article states: "vol [1?] is stated 
	to be the collected issues 'from March 1824 to January 1825'."
	This is evidently on the title page of vol. 1.

	vol. 3 vast majority of citations are given as 1827.
	CWR gives later pp. as Dec 1827 or "Dec" 1827.
	However, in the Richmond Index, the card for <b> </b> from p.356 of no.XI
	is written as 1827, and corrected to 1828.
	Peters volumes give a few as 1827 (1828).
	For many citations given as "1828" Sherborn lists:
	"Aug.-Nov." [<i>i.e.</i>Dec 31] 1827."

	Whether or not some parts of vol 3. were published in 1828 is a
	question, though the basis for this possibility is not clear.

	I currently give all vol.3 's as 1827.

	In support of this,Mathews says (Bibliography, Birds of Australis p.131).

		"Zoological Journal, Vol. III. 
		(pt.10), pp. 158-175, April-Sept. No., Sept. 1827;
		(pt.11), pp. 343-463, Sept.-Dec. 31st No., Dec, 31st, 1827."

	[APP: Mathew's dating is revelatory, as Dec. 31<sup>st</sup>, 1827 was
	a Sunday. Thus, it appears the Mathews did not have <b>specific</b> information
	about the date of availability but rather had reason to believe that it was
	available <b>sometime</b> in 1827.
	I am subsequently (2006.07.09) not so convinced of what this means. Societies certainly
	met not infrequently on Sundays in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. I wonder, as well, what
	Mathews' dates refer to -- publishing dates? meeting dates? or even if he knew himself?
	]

	Mark Brown communicates (<i>in litt.</i> 2007.05.21).
	In Monographia heliceorum viventium by L. Pfeiffer (1848) he lists the dates for the Z. J. as:

	Vol. I N.1-3 1824, 
		N.4 1825
	Vol. II N.4-7 1825 
		N.8 1826
	Vol. III N. 9-11 1827. 
		12 1826
	Vol. IV N. 13 &amp; 14 1828,

	Vol. V N.17 &amp; 18 1830, 
		N.19 1831,
		N.20 1834

When sold as a group it was sold as five books volumes 1-5 and one book- plates only, six altogether.

	(From the "Official Web site" dated Feb. 2016 Accessed 2021.02.09

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

		EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:
	Yu. I. Chernov

	English title: Russian Journal of Zoology (1997-1999)
	Since 2000, the Russian Journal of Zoology, the English version of the journal of the 
	Russian Academy of Sciences Zoologicheskii Zhurnal, is no longer being published as a separate title, 
	but has been merged into the journal Entomological Review.

	It is the oldest periodical in Russia covering all the branches of zoology. 
	The journal features contributions on the relationship between evolution and phylogenesis of animals, 
	species, taxonomy, onthogenesis, evolutionary and functional morphology, embryology, hystology, cytology, 
	bionics, ecology, biocenology, biological productivity of fauna of land and sea, 
	problems of zoogeography, genesis and development of faunas.

	Among the applied problems priority is given to the fundamentals of the fish industry, 
	hunting, and pest control. Equally welcome are contributions on restoration and protection of 
	populations and on the problems of biological water quality control and biological treatment of polluted water.
	A special section is devoted to methods of zoological studies. 
	The journal also presents information on the activities of russian and foreign zoological institutes, 
	their scope of work and developments, and chronicle of meeting, conferences, research expeditions, etc.
	The Reviews section includes book reviews of russian and foreign publications

	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	This is confusing to me, as I have two taxa cited to the "Zool.J.[Russ.]

	2006 Zool.J.[Russ.] 85 p. ??? Larvivora cyane nechaevi (Red'kin)
	2008 Zool.J.[Russ.] 87 no.09 p. 1097 Numenius phaeopus rogachevae Tomkovich

	Should these be cited to the "Entomological Review" ? (seems weird).
	Or "Ent.Rev.Zool.zh." ?
	Should abbreviation be "Zool.zh." ?

	Uncertainties exist regarding the dates of taxa from this work, and I asked Daria
	Wingreen-Mason of the Cullman Library at the Smithsonian Institution. As always, her
	careful and knowlegable work produced interesting results, and I include some of those
	here (2007.01.24) :
	<pre>
At the bottom of the first page of Gmelin's article on Shaw's <i>Zoology of New Holland</i>
("<i>Auszuge aus G. Shaw's Thiergeschichte von Neuholland</i>." in <i>Gottingisches Journal
der Naturwissenschaften</i>. Bd.1: Hft.2, pg.143-148) there is a footnote citing that v.1:
nos.1-2 of Shaw's Zoology were published in 1794, and no.3 was published in 1795.

The article on Shaw's <i>Zoology of New Holland</i>, as you will see, contains references to
the entire publication <i>i.e.</i> there is a footnote pertaining to each plate.  According
to Engelmann, the British Museum catalog, and Nissen (Zoo.), together, the three parts of
the <i>Zoology of New Holland</i> consist of 33 pages and 12 color plates (by Sowerby).
	
Given that plates IX and X are dated 9 Sept 1794, it is suspect indeed that Mathews states the
Linn. Soc. received pt. (<i>i.e.</i> no.) III on 4 Feb 1794; but it would not be the first
time plates were printed and issued before the text, even though it was not a very common
practice. And as you say, it very well could be a typo.

I found in our collection an incomplete copy of Shaw's <i>Zoology of New Holland</i>. It
is *bound-in* with three other titles that were originally issued simultaneously by Shaw,
Sowerby, and James Edward Smith. You'll be especially interested to know that tipped in
with Shaw's <i>Zoology</i> is a note from Gregory M. Mathews to Richmond discussing
Mathews' very own copy of the <i>Zoology</i>. Mathews writes of seeing the Linn. Soc. copy and
then goes on to transcribe one of the wrappers from that copy about a part published in
1794.  It says:
	"Zoology / of / New Holland / by / George Shaw M.S. F.R.S/ etc. etc. / The figures by
	/ Sowerby F. L. S. / This volume contains / The [illegible] Parrot The Long-necked
	Tortioise / The [illegible] [Perops ?]  The serrated lobster / in binding the work,
	the order of the pages only is to be [attended ?] to in the / Description[s?], which
	are immediately to follow the corresponding plates / London / M.DCC.XCIV"
 
This description is clearly different from the one described in <i>Gottingisches</i>. Mathews
then goes on to describe his own copy (which lacked plates 7 & 8) which he outlined by part,
corresponding page numbers and plate numbers, plate names, and date.  In his note, he clearly
dates his Part 3 as <b>1795</b> [APP: emphasis added] even though he does not include the
corresponding page numbers for that part.

I have collated the parts of our incomplete copy and compared it against Gmelin's article.  The
plate names all check out, but there are two typos in the footnotes regarding part
numbers:<ol><li>In footnote "b" at the bottom of page 143, referring to "Didelphis pygmaea"
it reads:
	b) Nr. I. Pl. I. S. 5. f.
According to our copy "Didelphis pygmaea" is actually plate 2 and should read:
	Nr.I. Pl.II. S.5 f.</li>
<li>In footnoote "e" at the bottom of page 145, referring to "Psittacus eximus" it reads:
	e) Nr. I. Pl.II. S. I. ff.
According to our copy, "Psittacus eximus" is actually plate 1 and should read:
	Nr.I. Pl.I. S.1 ff.</li></ol>
Interestingly, plate 1 "Psittacus eximus" appears to have had the plate number and
genus/species name rubbed off. I don't know if it is true of all copys. And that's just the
tip of the iceberg. The signature marks are all wonky.  There two known signature F's
and 2 signature G's, with F and G appearing once in parts 2 and 3. The second set of 21/21
describing plate 8 is lacking in our copy, but I consulted an online version from the State
Library of New South Wales which includes both the text and plate. (Go to:
http://image.sl.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/ebindshow.pl?doc=dixson/a319;thumbs=36).  
 
Shaw's <i>Zoology of New Holland</i> was orginally published in parts with James Edward Smith's
<i>A specimen of the botany of New Holland</i>, and a combined work by Smith and Shaw on New
Holland titled <i>Zoology and Botany of New Holland and the isles adjacent</i>. Our copy has
all these titles bound together. The title page bound in with Shaw's work is the combined
title: <i>Zoology and botany of New Holland and the isles adjacent</i>. On it Richmond has
written in pencil "title differs from copy in Phila. Acad."  It is most likely that this title
page was printed after all the works were finished in 1795. It's no wonder this work is a mess.

	[Zoologiia, Vol. 3(Gady i plazy) (1822)]

Mathews comments:
"This means that the book is the second volume of a series entitled "Zoologiia,"  the one dealing with Birds. 
Only six volumes were issued, the work being too big for completion
though perhaps other events, such as war, interfered with the project.

	These dates are as reported by Zimmer, who is quoting the work of Sherborn
	{<cite>Ann.Mag.Nat.Hist.,(6) <b>20</b>, p.483</cite>}

See, Steinheimer FD, Dickinson EC, &amp; Walters M. 2006. "<i>The zoology
of the voyage of the HMS Beagle Part III. Birds</i>: new avian names,
their authorship and their dates." BBOC <b>126</b>:(3):171-193. They
discusses this question in detail. For <i>Strix punctatissima</i> the
plate (by Gould) was evidently published first (in 1838) and the text (by
Gray) subsequently in 1839.</li>
<li>Steinheimer, Dickinson, &amp; Walters also argue that the authorship
for <i>Strix punctatissima</i> should be Gould &amp; Gray.
<li>These authors also take an approach to authorship attribution which, in my view,
employs a "flexible" interpretation of the Code. For example they attribute authorship of <b>Myiobius</b> to Gray
arguing "It is clear from p.46 of the <i>Zoology</i> that G.R. Gray was its author, not Darwin. Zimmer (1952)
should have seen from the work, especially its introductory pages, the significant role Gray played, and from p.46
Gray's staked claim to authorship."
	The text of p.46 indicates that Mr.Gould had proposed the name Tyrannula, but Mr. G.R.Gray pointed out that Tyrannulus
had been proposed as a genus name by Vieillot, and "therefore he (Gray) proposes <i>Myiobius</i>."

This text does NOT seem to be written by either Gould, or Gray, or they would not refer to themselves in the manner they did.
Rather it appears likely to me that the text was written by Darwin. The entire case is a complex and confusing one, and I feel
difficult to resolve with certainty given the current Code.
The mere "proposal" of a name does not, by my understanding, satisfy the requirements for authorship.
Hundreds of manuscript names constitute "proposals" yet they are not allowed as the basis for authorship.

In this muddled and confused matter, these authors do not hesitate to criticize the late John Zimmer for
not having reached the same conclusion they do now, despite his having made decisions under a different Code, and with different
prevailing conventions.

	1. Generally referred to as: "Historja Naturalna"

	2. Sometimes dated as 1797.  There appears to be a 1797 reprint,
		which may explain this.

	3. Sometimes dated as 1799 (eg CWR.)  I don't understand the basis
		for this.
