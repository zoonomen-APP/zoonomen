THE Fifth. Volume of the ' Catalogue of the Birds in the British 
Museum' contains an account of all the species of Warblers and 
Thrushes known at present; it has been prepared by Mr. II. 
Seebohm, whose special acquaintance with this group of Birds is 
probably unequalled. The total number of species described amounts 
to 344, of which no less than 303 are in the British Museum; 
they are represented by 2560 examples. 

Of the principal donors we have to mention the author himself, 
Capt. Stackhouse Piawill, E. DuCane Godman and 0. Salvin, 
Esqrs., Lieut.-Col. Irby, Lord Lilford, and Canon Tristram. 
The frequent occurrence on the following pages of the name 
of B. H. Hodgson, Esq., is a testimony of the lasting value of 
the collections which he deposited in the Museum nearly forty 

years ago.

INTRODUCTION. 

WHEN I undertook to prepare the fifth volume of the Catalogue of 
Birds, at the request of ,Dr. Giinther, I hoped to be able, by 
devoting to it a year's work, to render it as nearly perfect as the 
present state of our ornithological knowledge would permit. After 
two years' close application I am obliged to admit that many 
difficult points have had to be somewhat hurriedly settled for want 
of time to work them out, or to be left undetermined for want of 
material upon which to base an opinion. I must also ask for indulgence 
for the errors and omissions which are sure to be found 
in the voluminous synonymy required to make an index, not only 
to the nomenclature, but also to the general literature of each 
species treated of in the volume. I hope, however, that the results 
of my work are at least worth the labour I have bestowed upon it, 
and that I have not only removed many difficulties from the study 
of a group of birds which have hitherto been in a greater confusion 
than many others, but also smoothed the way towards the solution 
of some problems which puzzle all ornithological students. 

It is only fair to those who cannot but think that my treatment 
of genera in this volume is more or less heterodox, that I should 
attempt some defence or explanation in these introductory remarks. 
If I am accused of disturbing the existing genera of 

iXTKODrCTIOX. 

birds, in some instances by cutting up recognized genera, and in 

others by uniting several together, I can only plead that I have 

not done so capriciously, but in oider to facilitate the perception of 

the community of origin, -which must more and more interest those 

who accept the theory of evolution. 

It has been accepted as an axiom amongst ornithologists that 
genera must be founded upon structural characters. The reader 
will rind that in the first division of my work I have made use of 
characters that are not structural in defining some genera, and 
have, in many cases, considered so-called structural characters as 
having only value enough to divide genera into subgeneric groups. 
In the second division of my work I have convinced myself that 
these so-called structural characters have no generic value at all, 
and I have been obliged to fall back upon colour or pattern of 
colour as the only character which indicates neir relationship. In 
my opinion the pattern of the colour in the family or subfamily of 
Turdinse is a character which is more trustworthy i as showing community 
of origin), which in fact dates further back than the shape 
of the wings, tail, or bill. 

The species included in this volume are admitted by most modern 
ornithologists to be the most highly developed group of birds. 
Amongbt them are found the finest songsters, showing the highest 
development of the vocal organs, whilst few families can rival them 
in their powers of flight. In many species their range of migration 
extends from beyond the limit of forest-growth in the Arctic 
regions to the limit of continental land in the Southern hemisphere. 
It is difficult to say which of the two subfamilies is most highly 
developed. The Sylviinse have acquired a complete double moult, 
and have most of them lost the spotted plumage of their remote 
common ancestors, not only in the adult but also in the young; but 
they still retain the seutellated tarsus. The Turdinse, on the other 
hand, have scarcely the rudiments of a spring moult, and retain 
the spotted plumage of their remote common ancestors in the nestling 
plumage, but the seutellated tarsus only occasionally appears in the 
very young birds of a few species. On the whole, however, I am 

inclined to give the palm to the latter group. They are un


doubtedly the finest songsters. It may be that their greater size 

and strength has rendered the other changes less necessary. They 

EraRODTJCOCIOK. IX 

are one of the most cosmopolitan groups of birds, and undoubtedly 
the most cosmopolitan of Passerine birds. Prom these two characters, 
their high development and the cosmopolitan character of 
their distribution, we may infer that they are an example of the 
most numerous, most recent, and most nearly allied groups of 
birds. In fact they form one enormous genus. There has been no 
time or opportunity for intermediate forms to die out. Nature 
has not yet split them up into genera; in fact she has as yet only 
very imperfectly segregated them into species. Under these circumstances 
their subdivision into generic groups is to some extent 
arbitrary. I have endeavoured to choose my types of genera as 
carefully as possible, and to define their limits (i. e. to draw a line 
where nature has drawn none) with as much judgment as possible. 
The keys to the genera are, I admit, very artificial, and will require 
modification when new species are discovered; but I have endeavoured 
to characterize the genera at length, and in most cases I 
trust that the instinct of the ornithological student will enable him 
to tell a Chat, for example, from a Eedstart, without being able to 
define the characters of each genus. 

It is also due to the student that some explanation should be 
given of the way in which conspecies *, or forms between which 
the difference is only subspecific, are treated in this volume. In 
the previous volumes of the ' Catalogue of Birds9 subspecific forms 
are recognized. This is an immense stride upon the hard and tight 
system of previous English ornithologists who refuse to acknowledge 
the imperfectly segregated species which undoubtedly exist 
in nature, because forsooth their binomial system of nomenclature 
does not easily lend itself to their discrimination. The American 
system, clumsy as it is, has undoubtedly the advantage of being 
far in advance of the old mode. We must all admit that Oorone 
macrorhyncha, var. levaillanti is most objectionable as a name for 
an extreme form, and one, moreover, which leaves the intermediate 
forms nameless. It is vefy important that no mistake should be 
made as to what constitutes a conspecies. Two forms may be very 
closely allied; but if the difference between them, however small it 
may be, is constant, and is not attributable to age, sex, or season, 

* I am indebted to Professor Schlegel for this word. 
ItfTRODTTC HON . 

tlie probabilii ios aro thai it is a specific difference. On the other 
hand, if the two forms are bo closely allied that they interbreed 
and produce fertile offspring, which again interbreed, wo may draw 
two inferences—first, that the difference between the two forms 
is only subspecific, and, second, that between the two extremes 
must be an infinite gradation of intermediate forms. If the two 
forms have different areas of geographical distribution (which is 
usually the case), the intermediate ones will be found where the 
two areas overlap. If, from any cause, the species should be exterminated 
in the overlapping areas, and the causes which produced 
the variations of the two forms still continue, the peculiarities 
of each become emphasized, until they become so far separated, 
that should their areas of distribution again overlap they will 
nevertheless not interbreed, and the two species may be considered 

to be completely segregated. Under these circumstances, I have 
preferred to retain the binomial nomenclature for each of the extreme 
foims, reserving the trinomial name for the intermediate 
ones, uniting the two specific names by a hyphen, and placing the 
name of the bird first which it most resembles. Sterile hybrids 
may be denoted also by a trinomial name, the two specific names 
being united by a cross, the name of the male taking the precedence. 


Whilst I have endeavoured to bring the treatment of genera and 
of specific and subspecific forms into harmony with the latest 
discovories of science, and therefore may be considered an ornithological 
revolutionist by those who have not yet accepted the 
modern theories of evolution, upon questions of nomenclature I have 
adopted conservative principles. The former involve questions of 
fact, in which it is necessary to march with the progress of research; 
the latter are merely questions of names, in which it must be obvious 
to the merest tyro that change is in itself an evil. It appears 
to me that the recent attempts to carry out certain parts of the 
Stricklandian code to an extreme that may not inaptly be called 
revolutionary, has been productive of much confusion and unnecessary 
novelty. This I have endeavoured studiously to avoid by 
retaining the names in familiar use for many common birds, even 
where those names are not the oldest. I have only rejected them 
in cases where the name has been so frequently misapplied to 

INTRODUCTION. XI 

other species as to make it doubtful which it might be intended 
to designate, or "where the name was first used for another species 
which was also clearly defined. The violation of the rules 
of nomenclature laid down by the British Association for the 
Advancement of Science is nothing new in ornithology. I know of 
no writer who attempts to carry them out in their entirety. The 
modern attempt to carry out the law of priority regardless of 
con sequences, which has introduced so many unknown names into 
our nomenclature to the detriment of the study of ornithology, has 
generally been in direct violation of the equally important law of 
clear definition, which, if it were in its turn carried out in the same 
unrelenting manner, would further complicate our nomenclature to 
a perhaps still greater degree. If the new names already attempted 
to be introduced be carefully examined, it will be found that they 
generally fail in clear definition. It appears to me to be a great 
mistake to rake up old and little-used names, and to adopt them 
because the balance of collateral evidence that they were intended 
by their authors to be applied to certain species is in their favour. I 
venture to hope that future ornithologists will retain the old familiar 
names, even if the law of priority has to be modified to countenance 
their retention. I have accordingly adopted the law of priority 
with the following modifications—that names which have been 
extensively misapijlied must be rejected, and names otherwise 
unobjectionable must be retained, if a majority of ornithological 
writers have used them, even though they may not be the oldest. 
The adoption of this conformation of the law to the practice of the 
good old times would also have another immense advantage. It 

would enable us to omit the authority for the specific name, as all 
names would henceforth be yplurimorum auctorum, and thus the 
stigma that our names are after all trinomial would be avoided. 
Like many other conservative practices, this may not be very 
logical, but I take it to be an eminently practical solution of the 
difficulties that surround ornithological nomenclature. 

The following explanations are necessary to make the synonymy 
intelligible:— 
" Tardus modestm, Elyth nee Eyton" means that Blyth gave this 
name to the species in question, that Eyton had previously given 

INTRODUCTION. 

xn 
the same name to another species—a fact which Blyth did not 
know or did not remember at the time. 
" Saxicola leucomela, Pall, apud Dresser,? means that, in my 
opinion, Dresser was in error when he identified the species in question 
with the "species to which Pallas gave the above-mentioned 
name. 
"Sylvia sarda, Marmora fide Temm." means that Temminck 
ascribes this name to Marmora, but that I have been unable to 
find any publication in which this name was given by Marmora. 
The following contractions are used in the list of specimens:— 
« [C] " means " Collected by;" 
" [P.] " means " Presented by ?' 
" [E.] " means " Beceived in exchange from." 
The thanks of the author are due to various gentlemen for the 
loan of specimens, many of them types, without which it would 
have been impossible to work out this obscure group satisfactorily— 
particularly to George JN. Lawrence, Esq., Canon Tristram, Dr. 
Sclater, 0. Salvin, Esq., E. D. Godman, Esq., Captain "Wardlaw 
Eamsay, Allan Hume, Esq.. Dr. Scully, W. T. Blanford, Esq., 
Captain Shelley, II. E. Dresser, Esq., W. E. Brooks, Esq., John 
Gould, Esq., E. W. H. Holdsworth, Esq., and Howard Saunders, Esq. 
The author also wishes to record his especial thanks to Mr. E. 
Bowdler Sharpe for innumerable acts of courtesy in giving him 
assistance, frequently at considerable personal inconvenience; and 
also to acknowledge the obligations he is under for the facilities 
which have been so generously afforded him of examining types 
and other specimens in the Museums at Cambridge, Berlin, Prank-
fort, Bremen, Hamburg, Leyden, Paris, Copenhagen, St. Petersburg, 
Moscow, "Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.

Bill slender, but rather wide and depressed; -wing* long and 
flat, with a very small bastard primary not more than halt' the 
length of the second, the latter generally longer than the secondaries. 
Composed of biids generally migratory.—tiharjje, Vol. iv. p. 7. 

The family of Turcliche, as defined by Mr. Sharpc in his modifications 
of SundevalFs classification of the IVseres, in tho last 
volume of the Catalogue of Birds, is an artificial one. It consists 
of birds belonging to two distinct families, which arc separated 
from each other by structural characters of greater importance (/. e. 
extending in all probability to a remoter geological period) than 
those which divide either of them from the Mnsdcapiche and the 
Timelnclce, as defined in the classification referred to. Under these 
circumstances I have endeavoured to meet the difficulty by making 
two provisional subfamilies, which I characterize as follows:— 

SYLVIINJE. The young in first plumage differ very slightly in 
colour from the adult, both being generally unspotted, both above 
^and below, and the difference being confined to the shade or degree 

V#OL. V. B 

of colour, which in generally most conspicuous on the underparts. 
In tlu» rare instances in which the upper parts are spotted in the 
adult, tho spots are leas conspicuous in the young birds. In the 
first autumn before migration, if a partial moult takes place, 
it is simply a renewal of certain feathers by feathers of the same 
colour, so that, in winter, birds of the year are generally easily recognizable 
by a diil'erence of shade in the colour, especially in that 
of the undorparis. This deference, however, is lost in the complete 
moult which takes place in both adult and umng in spring, a moult 
which usually takes place in March shortly before the spring migration 
begins. In autumn, usually in September, shortly before the 
birds return to their winter quarters, a second annual complete 
moult takes place in adult birds. Tho autumn plumage is usually 
intermediate in colour between the spring plumage and that of the 
bird of the year. Curiously enough, this peculiarity in tho colour 
of the immature bird, and in the subsequent moults which the plumage 
undergoes, is correlated with the existence of scutellations on 
the front of tho tarsus. 

TURI)INJ3. The young in nr>t plumage differ from the adult in 
having (he upper and the underparts spotted, whether that is or is 
not the case in the adult. Instead of two moults in tho year, there 
is only one, in autumn, the spring plumage being obtained by abrasion, 
or by casting the points of the feathers. Where any feathers 
have become much worn by the spring, they are replaced by new 
ones, but nothing approaching a complete moult is observable. 
Under these circumstances the young birds would have to carry 
their nestling plumage, or the greater part of it, until the second 
autumn. To avoid this they have a complete moult, from immature 
plumage to adult, in their lirst autumn before they migrate. Consequently 
the winter plumage of the young and adult is the same, 
and they can generally only be distinguished by an isolated feather 
here and there, generally on the wing-covert s or innermost secondaries, 
which have a pale tip as in the immature plumage. These 
peculiarities of moulting appear in this group of birds to be always 
associated with a plain tarsus, exeejjt occasionally in very young 
birds of one or two species. 

"When sufficient facts have been accumulated to make a classification 
of 1 he Passeros possible, it is probable that the Mascivapidee 
and the 2vnaeVddtv will be all or most of them absorbed in the families 
Ttirdidce and SylvUdiv, each of which may be again subdivided 
into* Turdine, Timeliine, and Muscicapine groups of genera or subfamilies.

The genus Sylvia contains about a score species of birds closely 
allied to Phylloacfypm, Acroct'/ihulus, and Hypuluis. In live of tho 
species the bastard primary is so minute that it does not project 
beyond the primary-coverts, and in none does it project beyond 
those feathers more than (KJ inch. Tho tail is nearly even in two 
species, in three species tho outside feathers are about O'l inch 
shorter than tho longest, in four species about 0*2, in four species 
0-2."), in four species 0*35, and in one 0--1. The bill is shorter and 
less depressed at the base than in I'III/UOSCDJUIS, and tho rictal 
brislles are only slightly developed. The feet and tarsus are stout, 
and the latter is scutellated in front. Tho males of many of tho 
speoiea have black heads, and most of tho species have white on tho 
outside tail-feathers. Most of the species have the tail shorter than 
tho wing. In two species the tail is slightly longer than the wing, 
in another species more decidedly longer than tho wing, and in two 
other species tho tail is still more lengthened. The centre of distribution 
of tho genus is undoubtedly the basin of the Mediterranean, 
and several species arc resident on its shores. One species is a resident 
as far north as the south of England ; but niosl of the species 
are migratory, brooding in Europe and wintering in Africa. Several 
species extend their range eastwards as far as Turkestan in the 
breeding-season, wintering in India; and one spocies at least has 
been found in China. Most of the species are songsters of greater 
or less merit.

In the adult male hi spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is brownish grey, browner on the quills, wing-coverts, 
and innermost secondaries, and slightly greyer on the head, mmp, 
upper tail-coverts, and tail; the wing-coverts, the innermost 
secondaries, the outside tail-feathers, the feathers of the rump, and 
the upper tail-coverts, and occasionally the scapulars, forehead, and 
lower back, arc more or less distinctly margined and broadly tipped 
with greyish white, the pale tips being emphasized by a narrow 
transverse subterminal dark-brown bar; similar bars are present 
more or less distinctly on neaily every leather of the underpays, 
which are otherwise greyish white, slightly browner on the 
breast, flanks, thighs, and under tail-Coverts; axillaries and under 
wing-coveits bumsh white, generally transversely barred with dark 
grey ; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill of typical shape, 

dark brown, the under mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles 
few and slender. Wing very pointed, the second and third primaries 
being about equal and longest; bastard primary very 
minute, falling short of the primary-coverts by about 04 inch. 
Tail shorter than the wing, slightly rounded, the outside feathers 
being from Q'25 to 0*15 inch shorter than the longest. Logs,, feet, 
and claws pale slaty brown. Length of wing 3*5 to 3*35 inches, 
tail 3*0 to 2-8, oilmen 0*7 to 0-6, tarsus 0*05. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn 
moult the upper parts are slightly browner, and the barring bol h 
above and below more distinct. Birds of the year are browner both 
above and below, and the bars on the under surface are generally 
confined to the under bail-coverts.

fnid Turkestan. It passes on migration thiough the south of 
France, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, and Persia. Its winter quarters 
are unknown, hut, as it is said to pass thiough Nubia in spring 
and autumn, and has not been recorded from the Transvaal, they 
are doubtless somewhere iu Central Africa.

* According to the Strieklandian code of nomenclature aclo|)ted by the British 
Association, the proper name of the Wbitethroat is Sylvia conmivnis, Lath. 
Latham, however, cancelled his own name, and modestly considered our bird 
a variety only of the phantom continental species, the Parus cintrevs of Brisson. 
It being impossible to identify Brisson'h bird with any known species of Sylvia, 
Latham's name adopted from Brisson must be entirely ignored, leaving the 
coast clear for Sylvia cinerea of Bechstein. The British-Association rules 
having so generally failed in their object, we may safely violate them in 
fat our of the name in common use. It is possible that Daubenton's plate may 
have been drawn from a museum skin of a Wbitethroat; but it is obvious that 
he did not intend it for this bird, nor did such an idea ever cross Boddaert's 
mind. I look upon Motacilla rufa of Boddaert as another phantom species, and 
propose to ignore the name altogether. (Coiif. Seebohm, ' Ibis,' 1870, p. 311.)

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is greyish brown, darkest on the wings and tail, and 
shading into ash-grey on the head and upper tail-coverts; -Ringcoverts 
and innermost secondaries broadly edged with pale chestnut; 
outside tail-feathers paler than the rest, and broadly edged with 
white. Underparls white, purest on the throat and belly, with a 
vinous tinge on the breast, and shading into buff on the flanks ; a 
wdiite patch on the edge of the wing just below ilie carpal joint; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts pale grey, the latter frequently 
with darker centres; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill of 
typical shape, dark brown, the lower mandible pale at the base; 
rictal bristles only slightly developed. Wing pointed, with the 
second, third, and fourth primaries nearly equal in length; bastard 
primary very minute, falling short of the primary-coverts by 0*1 to 
0*2 inch. Tail shorter than the wing, the outside feathers about 
0*2 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. 
Length of wing 2*9 to 2-5 inches, tail 2*7 to 2*3", culmen 0*55 to 0-48, 
tarsus 0*8. 

In tho female the greyish brown of the back extends also on to the 
head and upper tail-coverts, and the vinous tinge on the breast is

absent. After the autumn moult the male assumes the plumage of the 

female. hi link of the, year the colour of the upper parts is still 

less grey, and almost approaches a dull chestnut-brown. 

The Whitethroat, or White-throated Warbler, is the commonest 

species of the genus, and has an extensive range, breeding throughout 

the whole of Europe, extending southwards to many of the islands 

of the Mediterranean, and northwards to within a hundred miles of 

the Arctic Circle. Eastwards its breeding-range extends to Persia, 

"Western Siberia, and Turkestan. Its winter quarters are Western, 

Central, and Southern Africa, and probably a 
few may remain in 

North Africa to breed.

* The arguments in favour of retaining the name in common use for the 
Garden-Warbler are precisely the same as those which I have endeavoured to 
bring forward in the case of the Whitethroat. According to the strict letter of 
the law, Sylvia simplex, Lath., is the name which ought to be used. As before, 
Latham subsequently ignored his own, name, and degraded our bird to the rank 
of a variety of the Motacilla horfends of Gmelin. The latter species is either 
the female of the Orphean Warbler, oris a phantom species : if the former, the 
name must be used for the Orphean Warbler, a step which the most faithful 
adherents of the Association code have not hitherto adopted; if the latter, the 
name of Sylvia hortensis, Bechst., may be adopted with perfect propriety. The 
name of Sylvia bciliearia, Linn., is obviously out of court, inasmuch as, besides 
the fatal objection of incorrect definition on the part of Linnaeus, it would have 
to stand as Linn, nee Bechst., nee Lath., nee Pallas, nee Wolf, nee Naum., and 
a host of minor authorities. {Conf. Seebohm, ' Ibis,' 1879, p. 312.)

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 

TURPI DiE. 

upper parts is olive-brown, darker and greyer on the wings and 
tail, and slightly paler on the margin of the wing-eoverts and innermost 
secondaries. Underpays greyish white, purest on the belly 
and on the edge of the wing just below the carpal joint, and shading 
into pale olive-brown on the breast, flanks, and the centre of the 
under tail-coverts; axillaries and under wing-coverts buff, the 
latter with darker centres ; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill 
of typical shape, dark brown, the lower mandible pale; rictal 
bristles few and blonder. Wing pointed, with the second and third 
primaries nearly equal in. length ; bastard primary very minute, not 
extending as far as the primary-coverts by 0*1 to 0*2 inch. Tail 
considerably shorter than the wing, nearly even, the outside feathers 

being scarcely 0-1 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and 
claws bluish grey. Length of wing 3*2 to 3*0 inches, tail 2*3 to 2-2, 
culmen 0*53 to 0*5, tarsus 0*8. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn 
moult the upper parts are more olive and the underparts buffer. 
Birds of the year scarcely differ from adults in autumn plumage. 

The breeding-range of the Garden-Warbler scarcely extends 
northwards as far as the Arctic Circle, and to the east it is bounded 
by the Ural mountains. 'This bird breeds in the south of Spain, and 
only passes on migration through South Italy, Greece, and Asia 
Minor, but is said to breed in the Jordan valley. It passes through 
Forth-cast and North-west Africa on migration, winteiing probably 
in Central Africa, and certainly in South Africa.

In the adult male m spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is slate-grey; head nearly black; wings and wing-
coverts dark slate-grey, the innermost secondaries edged wit h bullish 
brown; tail dark blate-grey, the outside feathers, including their 
shafts, white, with a dark margin on the basal half of the inside 
web, becoming broader towards the base; a web of white extends 
from the tip for nearly an inch on the second outside tail-feathers, 
and a smaller wedge of white extends for a quarter of an inch on 
the third feather of the tail on each side; chin and throat black, a 
narrow white line from the gape towards the shoulder separates the 
black of the head from the black of the throat; a patch on the edge 
of the wing below the carpal joint and the whole of the underparts 
white, shading into buff on the breast and under tail-coverts, and 
into pale slate-grey on the Hanks and thighs ; axillaries and under 
wing-coverts greyish white, the latter with dark centres ; inner 

margin of qnills pale brown. Bill of typical shape, very dark brown, 

the lower mandible pale at the base ; rietal bustles nearly obsolete. 

"Wing rather pointed, the second, third, fourth, and fifth primaries 

nearly equal, the third being slightly the longest; bastard primary 

very minute, seldom extending as far as the primary-coverts. Tail 

shorter than the wing, the outside feathers about 0-25 inch shorter 

than the longest. 
Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of 

wing 2*85 to '2-6 inches, tail 2-55 to 2*35, culmen 0*6 to 0*55, 

tarsus 0-82. 

The female differs from tho male in having the head of the same 

colour as the back, with dark centres to the leathers, and tho throat 

gre}ish white. After the autumn moult the blark feathers of tho 

male on the throat have pale maigins. Birds of the y<ar of both 

sexes resemble the female, but have the upper parts browner, and 

the breast and flanks suffused with pale brown. 

RuppeU's Warbler has a very limited range. It breeds in Algiers, 

Greece, Asia Minor, and Palestine, passes through Egypt on migra


tion, and probably winters in Nubia and Abyssinia.

Sylvia orplieus and Sylvia jerdoni. 

European examples of lids species, wiih the culuien varying from 
0-08 to 0-0 inch, are very dihliuet from the Indian, Turkestan, and 
Persian form, -\\ith the culnien varying' irom 0*70 to 0*00, and 
might possibly he considered distinct species, were it not for the 
fact that examples from Asia Minor and Palestine are mrcnuediate, 
with the culmen varying from 0*74 to 0*04. We must therefore 
admit that the difference between the two forms is onh a feuhspeeiiic 
one, being completely bridged over by examples from intermediate 
localities. 

The synonymy of the Western and intermediate forms is as

* The circumstantial evidence in favour of the opinion that •' La Fauveite" of 
Bribson, Buffon, and Daubenton (upon which Gmelm founded his Motacilla 
hortenbiii) is the female of the Orphean Warbler is \ery btrong. It is not, however, 
apparently strong enough to induce even the strictebt adherents to the 
StriuLlandian code to transfer Grmehn's name to thib species. \\ e may therefore 
ignore the name altogether, and adopt Temminckb name for the Orphean 
Warbler, leaving also the etfast clear for Bechstem's Motacilla horteiibib to be 
applied to the Garden Warbler. (Conf. Seebohm, ' Ibis,' 1879, p. 310.)

In the adult m de in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dull slate-grey; head to below the eyes sooty black; 
wings and tail brown; innermost secondaries shading into pale 
brown on the margins; outside tail-feather on each side white on 
the outside web, at the apex, and for some distance on the inside 
web near the shaft, the dark brown of which is thus made conspicuous 
; the next two feathers on each side have wedge-shaped white 
spots at the apex. Underparts white, shading into pale greyish 
brown on the sides of the breast, flanks, thighs, axillaries, under 
wing-coverts, the centres of the under tail-coverts, and the inner 
margin of the quills. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, the lower 
mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles few and small. Wing 
with the third primary the longest, and the second about equal to 
the fifth• bastard primary small, sometimes as long as the primary-
coverts, and sometimes extending 0*2 beyond them. Tail shorter 
than the wing, the outside feathers about 0*2 shorter than the 
longest. Legs, feet, and claws bluish grey. Length of*wing 3*25 
to 2-95 inches, tail 2-0 to 2*5, culnien 0*08 to 0*0, tarsus 0*9. 

The female differs from the male in having the head only slightly 
darker and browner than the back. After the autumn moult no important 
change of plumage is perceptible. Birds of the gear scarcely 
differ from the adult, except that both sexes appear in the plumage 
of the female. Males after their first spring moult attain a plumage 
intermediate between that of the adult male and adult female. In 
Spanish skins the pale greyish brown of the underparts is replaced 
by pale buff. 

The Western Orphean Warbler breeds throughout Central and 

Southern Europe and Worth Africa. Intermediate forms between 

this and the Eastern subspecies occur in Asia Minor and Palestine. 

They winter in the valley of the Gambia, and probably in other 

parts of Central 
Africa.

This form differs from the preceding only in the length of the 
bill, the measurements of which have been already given, and in 
the fact that it does not appear ever to have the buff underparts 
which are characteristic of Spanish examples. 

The Eastern Orphean Warbler breeds in Persia and Turkestan, 
and winters in India and Arabia.

This is an excellent example of a species in the process of breaking 
up into three species. Typical examples of each present excellent 
characters, and have fairly well-defined geographical limits. 
Unfortunately, however, for the student who is anxious to define 
his species with greater accuracy than Nature has hitherto succeeded 
in accomplishing the tabk, intermediate forms occur, and individuals 
do not always recognize their geographical limits as most species 
do. As Hume very justly observes, this is a case in which some 
ornithologists will treat the birds as three species, whilst others 
will consider them to be only three races of one somewhat variable 
species. I prefer to treat them as subspecies, adopting the pro


visional hypothesis that the intermediate forms are the result of 
the interbreeding of the different races.

TUBDIDiE. 

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 

upper parts is palo slate-grey, more or less suffused with brown on 

tho back, lores, and ear-coverts• eye-stripe almost obsolete ; inner


most secondaries with paler edges; wings and tail brown on out


side feathers. Underparts white on the chin, throat, centre of belly, 

and under tail-coverts, shading into very pale brown on the breast 

and flanks ; axillarios and under wing-coverts white ; inner margin 

of quills pale huffish grey. Bill of typical shape, dark bluish grey, 

the under mandible 
pale at the base • rietal bristles few and 

slender. "Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and 

longest; second primary generally intermediate in length between 

tli© fifth and sixth, in very rare instances between the sixth and 

seventh ; bastard primary extending beyond the primary-coverts 

from 0-03 to 0*2 inch. Tail shorter than the wing; the outside 

feathers 0*15 to 0*2 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and 

claws bluish grey. Length of wing 2-65 to 2*45 inches, tail 2*4 to 

2-2, admen 0*51 to 0*44, tarsus 0*76. 

The fimttle scarcely differs from the male, but has not even the 

rudiments of an eye-stripe. After the autumn moult the breast and 

flanks are somewhat more suffused with brown. Birds of the year 

have the upper parts more suffused with brown, and the pale brown of 

the underparts extends to the under tail-coverts. The bill an d legs aie 

also somewhat paler. 
After the first autumn moult the back is greyer. 

The European form of the Lesser Whitethroat, or Lesser White-
throated Waiblcr, breeds throughout Europe, extending northwards 
beyond the Arctic Circle almost to the limit of forest-growth, and 
southwards to the Mediterranean. It winters in the southern portion 
of North Africa (Nubia, Abyssinia, &c.)« Occasionally examples 
from Siberia and India agree in wing-formula &c. with the European 
form. Examples ftom Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor agree 
in colour and size with small specimens of the Himalayan form.

having the second primary generally intermediate in length between 
the sixth and seventh, in rare instances between the seventh and 
eighth; in all other respects (size &c.) it does not differ from the 
Western form. 

The Siberian form of ihe Lesser "Whitethroat breeds throughout 
Siberia, extending northwards almost to the limit of forest-growth, 
and southwards into North Persia, Turkestan, and North-east China. 
It winters in Baluchistan and the whole of India and Ceylon. Examples 
occasionally occur in Europe which agree in wing-formula

being* suffused with brown to an all but imperceptible extent. The 
second primary is intermediate in length between the sixth and 
seventh, or seventh and eighth. It is on an average a larger bird 
than the Western form. Length of wing 2*8 to 2'5o inches, tail 2'5 
to 2-25, oilmen 0-56 to 0-51, tarsus 0-8 to 0*75. 
The Himalayan form of the Lesser Whitethroat breeds abundantly 
in the extreme north-west of Cashmere, and winters in the northwest 
provinces of India.

This species differs from its near allies in having the forehead and 
crown of a pale bluish-grey colour, gradually shading into the colour 
of the back, which is a pale isabelline brown. It is a small bird, 
the length of wing varying from 2*45 to 2-3 inches. A male in the 
collection measures—wing 2-43 inches, tail 2-22, culmen0-41. The 
exposed portion of the bastard primary measures 0*45 inch, and 
the second primary is equal to the seventh ; in other skins it is 
said to be intermediate in length between the seventh and eighth. 
The outside feathers of the tail are 0*2 inch shorter than the 
longest. 

Hume's Lesser "Whitethroat breeds in Afghanistan, and winters in

* Hemprich and Ehrenberg's diagnosis of Curruea momns does not contain 
a single character by which this species may be distinguished from Sylviamelanocephala; and had it not been for the present existence of the type 
in the Berlin Museum, no one could have suspected that their species was 
identical with the one so excellently defined by Menetries. The rejection of 
M&oetneVs name in favour of that of Hemprich and Ehrenberg is in direct defiance 
of the Stricklandian code, which in this instance appears to me to be based 
upon strict justice and common sense.

In the adult male in spring pi umagetho head and cheeks are dark 
slate-grey, approaching black, fading into light slate* grey on the 
rest of the upper parts ; the quills are brown, the innermost secondaries 
margined with brownish white; the tail is dark browTn, with 
the outside web and the tip for some length of the inside web of the 
outer feather on each side white; more or less white on the tips of 
the next feathers. TJnderparts white, with an isabelline tint on the 
breast and flanks; axillaries and under wing-coverts pinkish white; 
inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, 
the under mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles few and slender. 
"Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries longest; second primary 
intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh, or seventh and 
eighth; bastard primaiy extending 0-15 inch beyond the primary-
coverts. Tail shorter than the wing, outside feathers 0*35 inch shorter 
than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 
2-42 to 2-05 inches, tail 2-32 to 1-98, culmen 0-5 to 0-45, tarsus 
0-75. 

The female differs from the male in having the upper parts a nearly 
uniform sandy or huffish brown, somewhat darker and greyer on the 
head, and in having the underparts more suffused with isabelline. 
After the autumn moult the brown of the upper parts of the female 
is darker (less sandy), and the breast and flanks are also slightly 
darker in colour. • The winter plumage of the adidt male appears to 
be unknown. What I take to be males in first winter plumage 
resemble the adult female at the same season, but have nearly black 
centres to the feathers on the crown and ear-coverts. 

But little is known of the geographical distribution of Bowman's 
"Warbler. It breeds in Persia, and is apparently a resident in Palestine, 
and probably also in Abyssinia.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the head to below the eye 
is slate-grey, gradually shading into greyish chestnut on the centre 
of the hack, and shading again into paler slate-grey on the rump and 
upper tail-coverts ; the wing& and wing-coverts are dark brown, the 
primaries narrowly edged, and the wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries broadly edged with chestnut; the tail-feathers are dark 
brown, the two centre ones slightly greyer than the rest, and the two 
outside ones white from their apices as far as a line drawn from the 
base of the outer web to the centre of the margins of the inside web; 
the second outside feather on each side has a terminal wedge-shaped 
white patch, extending a quarter of an inch from the apex ; the 
chin is white, gradually fading into pale slate-grey on the throat, 
which fades into vinous rod on the breast and flanks, leaving the 
centre of the belly and the under tail-coverts nearly white ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts vinous red; inner margin of quills pale 
grey, with a slight chestnut tint. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, 
the under mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles few and slender. 
Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; 
second primary intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, 
or sixth and seventh; bastard primary small, but usually extending 
0*1 inch beyond the primary-coverts, in rare instances equal to them, 
and occasionally extending beyond them 0-2, Tail shorter than 
the wing, considerably rounded, the outside feathers varying from 
0*2 to 0*4 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 2*3 to 2-0 inches, tail 2-1 to 1*9, culmen 
0-48 to 0-4, tarsus 0*73. 

1. 8YLVU. 2,1 
The female differs from, the male in having the head, back, rump, 
and upper tail-coverts of a uniform reddish brown, causing- the chestnut 
margins of the innermost secondaries to appear duller from want 
of contrast. In the underparts of the female the pale slate-grey of 
the throat and the vinous red of the breast and Hanks are replaced 
by pale huffish brown. After the autumn moult the upper parts of 
the tnale are of a richer brown, which appears also on the tips of the 
slaty-grey feathers of the crown and rump. The upper parts of the 
female are also slightly richer in colour. There appears to be no 
change in the colour of the underparts in either sex. Young in 
first plumage of both sexes scarcely differ from the female in autumn 

plumage. 

The Spectacled Warbler may bo said almost to be confined to the 
basin of the Mediterranean, extending westwards as far as the 
Canary Islands and eastwards to Palestine. On the European coast 
it appears to be only a summer visitor, but on many of the islands 
and on the African coast it is said to be a resident.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is bluish grey, almost imperceptibly suffused with olive-
brown ; forehead and crown black; checks and nape bluish grey; 
wings and tail brown, narrowly margined on the outside webs with, 
olive-brown. Underparts pale bluish grey, shading into white on 
the centre of the belly ; axillaries and under wing-coverts white ; 
inner margin of quills pale grey. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, 
the under mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles few and very 
slender. Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal 
and longest; second primary a little longer than the" sixth ; 
bastard primary extending 0*15 inch beyond the primary-coverts. 
Tail shorter than the wing, outside feathers varying from 0*1 to 
0-2 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws bluish 
grey. Length of wing 3*0 to 2-6 inches, tail 2-5 to 2-2, culmen 0-58 
to 0*5, tarsus 0-85. 

The female differs from the male in having the black on the head 
replaced by rusty brown. After the autumn moult the upper parts 

1 . SYLVIA. 
are more suffused wiih huffish brown, and the underparts, cheeks, 
and nape are pale huffish brown. Birds of the year scarcely differ 
from adults in autumn plumage, except that the head of the male 
is intermediate in colour between that of the adult male and adult 
female. 

The male in first plumage is said to resemble the female, and to 
attain the black head in the first autumn by a change in the colour 
of the feathers, and not by a moult. It is also asserted that this 
species has no spring moult; but these alleged facts require verification. 


A curious local race (Sylvia heineleni) is found on the island 
of Madeira, having the entire head, throat, and breast black. It is 
said to occur accidentally, one or two individuals in a brood 
only possessing this peculiarity. It is probably an instance of 
partial melanism and has no claim to be considered even a subspecies. 


The Blackcap, or Black-capped Warbler, breeds throughout Europe 
to within two bundled miles of the Arctic Circle, and occasionally 
in Forth Africa, extending eastwards as far as Persia, where, however, 
it is very lare. Westvi ards it extends as far as the Azores. 
Some winter in South Europe and North Africa, others in Senegal.

In the adult on ale in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is buff, shading into bright giraffe-colour on the upper 
tail-coverts; the quills are buffish brown, with more or less distinct 
pale tips ; the innermost secondaries arc buff, shading to pale giraffe on 
the edges, and with a central streak of huffish brown along the shaft; 
the two central tail-feathers are bright giraffe, with a central streak 
of bullish brown along the shaft; the outside tail-feathers on each 
side white, second dark brown, broadly tipped and narrowly mar


gined with white, remainder dark brown, margined with bright 
giraffe. Underparts huffish white, very slightly darker on the breast 
and flanks; a buffish-white patch on the edge of the wing, just 
below the carpal joint; axillaries and under wing-coverts buffish 
white ; inner margin of quills pale buff. Bill of typical shape, brown 
above, pale below, slightly darker at the tip• rictal bristles few 
and slender. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest; second primary intermediate in length 
between the fifth and sixth, or sixth and seventh• bastard primary 
occasionally equal in length to the primary-coverts, but generally 
extending beyond them from 0*1 to 0-15 inch. Tail shorter than 
the wing, outside feathers about 0*15 inch shorter than the longest. 
Legs, feet, and claws very pale brown. Length of wing 2-35 to 2*0 
inches, tail 2*1 to 1*85, culmen 0*46 to 0*4, tarsus 0*71. 

The female does not appear to differ from the male, nor is there 
any appreciable difference between spring and autumn plumage, nor 
is it known that birds of the year differ from adults. 

The Desert-Warbler, as its name implies, is confined to dry and 
arid wastes in Algiers, the Sinaitic peninsula, and Southern Persia. 
It breeds in Turkestan, and winters in Baluchistan and Scinde.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is slate-grey ; wings brown, with narrow pale edges to 
the coverts, and broader pale edges to the innermost secondaries ; 
tail brown, with more or less white on three or four of the outside 
feathers on each side; chin, throat, and breast chestnut, shading 
into pale chestnut on the flanks, and into nearly white on the 
centre of the belly and under tail-coverts; a narrow white line extends 
from the base of the bill towards the shoulder, separating the 
chestnut of the underparts from the grey of the upper parts ; axillaries 
pale vinous grey. Under wing-coverts pale grey, with darker 
centres ; inner margin of quills pale grey, with a slight chestnut 
tint. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, the lower mandible pale 

at the base• rictal bristles few and slender. "Wing with the third 
and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary 
usually intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, occasionally 
between the fourth and fifth ; bastard primary very small, 
sometimes equal to the primary-coverts, sometimes extending 0*05 
inch beyond them. Tail shorter than the wing, the outside feathers 
0*2 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 2*45 to 2*25 inches, tail 2*25 to 2*0, culmen 
0*49 to 0*4, tarsus 0*75. 

The female differs from the male in having the slate-grey of the 

28 TTraDiD-ae. 

tipper parts replaced by earthy brown, and the chestnut of the chin, 

throat, breast, and flanks by buifisli while, with a slight vinous 

tinge on the sides of the breast. I have been unable to obtain 

dated skins in autumn plumage; but undated skins, in which the 

chestnut of tho underparts of the male is replaced by pale vinous, 

may prove to be in this plumage. Birds of the year are huffish 

brown on the breast and flanks, the male resembling the female, 

except in being slightly greyer on the upper parts. 

The basin of the Mediterranean may be said to be the breeding-

range of the Subalpine Warbler, probably extending eastwards as 

far as Persia. In Europe it is certainly only a summer visitor; 

but in North Africa it appears to be a partial resident.

In the adult male in spring jplumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is slate grey, shading into black on the nape, head, and 
ear-coverts; quills, wing-coverts* and innermost secondaries nearly 
black, all except the longest primaries narrowly edged with white 
on the external webs ; tail-feathers nearly black, the whole of the 
external web and the terminal half of the internal web of the outside 
feather on each side white, and more or less white at the tips 
of the next two feathers on each side. The underparts are mottled 
black and white, each feather being white, with a nearly black 
centre; the flanks are nearly uniform slate-grey; edge of the 
wing white; axillaries slate-grey; under wing-coverts mottled 
black and white ; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill of ty|ncal 
shape, nearly black, the under mandible pale at the base; rictal 
bristles nearly obsolete. Wing with the third and fourth primaries 
nearly equal and longest; second primary intermediate in length 
between the fifth and sixth; bastard primary extending about 
0*1 inch beyond the primary-coverts. Tail shorter than the wing ; 
outside feathers 0*3 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and 
claws pale brown. Length of wing 2*35 to 2*25 inches, tail 2-25 to 
2*15, oilmen 0*52 to 0*47, tarsus 0*75. 
The female scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn 
moult the white margins to the feathers of the underparts are 
longer, concealing more of the black centres. Birds of the year have

the upper parts brown, arid the feathers of the chin, throat, and 
breast white, with concealed black bases; the rest of the undorparts 
are pale brown. 

The Palestine Warbler appears to be confined to Cyprus and 
Palestine. It is not known that it is a migratory bird.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dark grey, more or less suffused with brown ; head, 
nape, and ear-coverts brownish black ; innermost secondaries brown, 
with pale edges; quiiteJi&ww34_jtai]^ory dark brown, approaching 
black, outside feathers probably tipped with white. Underparts 
nearly white, slightly suffused with brown on the sides of the 
breast, flanks, axillaries, and under tail-coverts; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts greyish white, the latter with darker centres; 
inner margin of quills pale brown. .Bill of typical shape, dark brown, 
the under mandible slightly paler at the base; rictal bristles long, 
but few and very slender. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal; second primary about equal to the eighth 
or ninth; bastard primary somewhat longer than usual, extending 
0*3 inch beyond the primary-coverts. Tail slightly longer than the 
wing, outside feathers 0*3 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, 
and claws dark bluish grey. Length of wing 2'56 inches, tail 2*56, 
oilmen 0*5, tarsus 0*85. 

The female of this bird is unknown, as is also the plumage of the 

birds of the year, or of both sexes after the autumn moult. 

Blanford's Warbler has hitherto only been known from a single 

example obtained in Abyssinia. Nothing is known of its migrations.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 

tipper parts is slate-grey, shading into black on the nape, head, and 

ear-coverts; occasionally the npper tail-coverts have darker centres ; 

innermost secondaries dark brown, broadly edged externally with 

pale grey; wing-coverts dark brown, narrowly edged with pale 

grey; quills dark brown, tipped with pale grey; tail dark grey, 

approaching black, the outer web of the outside tail-feather white, 

the inner web broadly tipped with white; several of the succeeding 

tail-feathers with a more or less developed terminal wedge of white. 

Underparts greyish white, fading into pure white on the chin, 

upper throat, and centre of belly ; edge of the wing white; axil


laries and under wing-coverts bluish grey; inner margin of quills 

pale brown. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, the under mandible 

pale at the base; rictal bristles nearly obsolete. "Wing with the 

third, fourth, and fifth primaries neaily equal; second primary 

intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh, or seventh 
and eighth; bastard primary extending from 0*05 to 0*15 inch beyond 
the primary-coverts. Tail longer than the wing; outside 
feathers 0*3 to 0*4 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and 
claws pale brown. Length of wing 2-35 to 2*1 inches, tail 2-DO 
to 2-25, oilmen 0-53 to 0-49, tarsus 0-8. 

The female differs from the male in having the upper parts slaty 
brown, shading into slate-grey on the crown and ear-coverts; the 
breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts are more or less suffused with 
isabelline brown. After the autumn moult the head of the male 
becomes a browner, duller black. Birds of the year scarcely differ 
from adult females. 

The Sardinian Warbler inhabits the basin of the Mediterranean. 
On the European side it is a partial resident, but on the African side 
it appears to be principally a winter vi&itor.

* Boddaert's name is accompanied by no description, but is published as the 
Latin name of "le Pitte-chou de Provence," figured by Daubeuton in the 
' Planches Enluminees.' The figure is sufficiently good to leave no reasonable 
doubt as to the species intended to be designated; and Boddaert's name may 
therefore beheld toha\e been " clearly defined;" nevertheless there seems to be 
no sufficient reason why the name in common use shoidd be changed.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is very dark sooty brown, shading into very dark slate-
grey on the head; innermost secondaries, wing-coverts, and quills 
dark brown, edged externally with pale brown; tail very dark grey, 
the outside web and tip of the outside feathers white. Underpays 
chestnut-brown, shading into white on the centre of the 
belly, and having the feathers of the chin and upper throat tipped 
with white; a white patch on the edge of the wing just below the 
carpal joint; under tail-coverts grey, with whitish tips ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts grey• inner margin of quills pale reddish 
brown. Bill of typical shape, very dark brown, the lower mandible 
pale at the base; rictal bristles short and slender. Wing with the 
fourth and fifth primaries slightly the longest; second primary equal 
to the ninth or tenth ; bastard primary extending 0*2 inch beyond 
the primary-coverts. Tail considerably longer than the wing; outside 
feathers 0*4 to 0'6 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, 
and claws pale brown. Length of wing 2-15 to 1*9 inch.es, tail 2*7 
to 2*3, culrnen 0*5 to 0*42, tarsus 0*75. 

The female differs from the male in having the general colour 
of the underparts pale cinnamon-brown instead of rich chestnut-
brown. After the autumn moult but little change in the plumage 
apparently takes place. Birds of the year are slightly paler and 
browner above, and have the underparts considerably paler than in 
the adult female. 

The Dartford Warbler is a resident in the south of England, some 
parts of France, the Spanish peninsula, and Italy, occasionally 
straying into Greece; it is also found in North Africa and Palestine, 
apparently wintering in the plains, and retiring to the hills to 

breed.

coverts are brown, more or less suffused with chestnut, which in the 
predominant colour on the back; the wings are brown, narrowly 
edged on the outside webs with pale chestnut; wing-coverts and 
innermost secondaries broadly edged with bright chestnut; tail-
feathers brown, narrowly edged with pale chestnut, the two centre 
feathers the same colour as the others ; the entire outside web and 
a large part of the inside web of the outermost feather on each side 
white, and small wedges of white at tho tips of the two next outer 
tail-feathers on each side. The whole of the underparts, including 
the axillaries and inner margin of quills, pale chestnut, shading into 
bright chestnut on the sides of the breast and Hanks. Bill of typical 
shape, dark brown, the under mandible palo at the base; rictal 
bristles few and slender. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary intermediate in 
length between the seventh and eighth; bastard primary extending 
about 0*1 inch beyond the primary-coverts. Tail somewhat longer

* There can scarcely .be a doubt that G-melin's name has the priority of that 
of Teniminck; but, since this bird has been in undisturbed possession of the 
latter for upwards of half a century, we may fairly ignore the former, on the 
ground that G-melin's description does not " clearly define" the species. Gmelin's 
name does not deserve to stand, inasmuch as he obviously never saw the bird, 
or he would scarcely have copied Cetti s error in ascribing the rufous tint to 
the head instead of to theflanks,^

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is very dark grey, approaching dull black on the head ; 
innermost secondaries, wing-coverts, and quills dark brown, edged 
externally with pale grey; tail dark grey, the outside feathers 
narrowly fringed with white on the outside web and the others 
with pale grey. Underparts dark grey, shading into nearly white 
on the centre of the belly and chin, with a slight vinous tinge on 
the flanks and thighs ; a white patch on the edge of the wing just 
below the carpal joint; under tail-coverts dark grey with nearly 
white margins; axillaries and under wing-coverts dark grey; 
inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill of typical shape, dark brown, 
the lower mandible pale at the base ; rictal bristles moderately 
developed. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal in length ; second primary generally intermediate in length 
between the seventh and eighth, occasionally between the sixth and 
seventh; bastard primary extending 0*15 inch beyond the primary-
coverts. Tail longer than the wing, considerably rounded ; outside 
feathers 0*3 to 0 4 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and 
claws pale brown. Length of wing 2-25 to 2 inches, tail 2*45 to 
2-2, culm en 0*46 to 0*41, tarsus 0*8. 

The female differs from the male in being browner both above 
and below. After the autumn moult the plumage of both sexes is 
browner, the female being slightly paler than the male ; and the 
birds of the year somewhat paler still, especially on the underparts. 

Marmora's Warbler does not appear to be a migratory bird. It 
is found in Portugal, the Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. 
It is said also to have occurred in Algiers, Greece, and Palestine.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is a palish chestnut-brown or giraffe-colour ; lores and 
the feathers behind the eye brown; eye-stripe huffish white, extending 
to the nape ; quills and wing-coverts brown, the outside 
webs margined with huffish white ; tail rich chestnut-brown, the 
two centre feathers with a more or less obscure broad terminal dark 
band, sometimes obsolete, the remaining feathers with broad terminal 
white bands and nearly black subterminal bands. The whole of 
the underparts very pale buffish white, slightly darker on the sides 
of the breast and flanks ; inner maigin of quills buff. Bill with 
the upper mandible brown and the under mandible horn-colour ; 
rictal bristles very small. "Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the sixth, bastard primary 0*7 to 0-5. Tail shorter than the wing, 
considerably rounded, the outside feathers 0*2 to 0*25 inch shorter 
than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 
3-5 to 3-0 inches, tail 2-9 to 2*5, culraen 0*8 to 0-7, tarsus 1*1 to 1-0. 

The differences in the colour of the plumage caused by age, sex, 
and season are very small. Examples from Abyssinia are on an 
average smaller than those from other localities, and might almost 
be allowed subgeneric rank, in which case they will stand as Sylvia 
minor (Cab.). 

The Eufous "Warbler breeds in Spain and Portugal, and throughout 
North Africa as far south as Abyssinia, in the latter country 
being a resident. It is said also to winter on the Gold Coast.

This species differs from the preceding in having the two centre 
tail-feathers greyish brown instead of rich chestnut-brown; the 
rest of the tail-feathers and the rump and upper tail-coverts are the 
same in both species, but in the rest of the upper parts the palish 
chebtnut-brown of the preceding species is replaced by greyish

brown; the very pale huffish white of the underparts is replaced 
in the present species by very pale greyish white; inner margins 
of qnills pale huffish brown. Bill with the upper mandible brown 
and the under mandible horn-colour ; rictal bristles very .small. 
Wings with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and 
longest; second primary about equal to the fifth ; bastard primary 
0-65 to 0-8. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 3*5

There are no differences in colour worthy of note attributable to 
age, sex, or season. 

The Grey-backed Warbler breeds in Italy, Greece, Asia Miner, 
Palestine, the Caucasus, Persia, and Turkestan. It winters in

The genus PhyUoscopvs comprises a small group of birds familiarly 
known as Willow-Warblers. Some of the species approach 
the genus Cryptoloplia so closely as scarcely to be generically 

38 
TXJEDIDiE. 

distinct. The "Willow-Warblers are essentially fly-catchers in their 
habits, and may constantly be seen catching* flies upon the wing. 
Their bills, if not very wide, are considerably depressed at the base, 
and the rictal biistles are well developed. Most of the species are 
migratory; the wing is long, flat, and pointed, whilst the bastard 
primary is very small; and the range of migration extends over 
thousands of miles. The migrations of others is confined to the 
plains within sight of the mountains where they breed. In these the 
wing is shorter, more concaved to tit the body, and rounded, whilst 
the bastard primary is larger, the vital energy required for its production 
not having been absorbed in lengthening the adjoining primaries. 
The tail is generally nearly even and frequently forked. All the 
species of the genus are quietly coloured, the upper parts varying 
from yellowish green to Imffish brown, and the underparts from 
yellow to buff or white. The axillaries and under wing-coverts are 
yellow, a character which will serve to separate all the species of 
the genus from the nearly allied genera. Most of the species whose 
nidirlcation is known build a semi-domed nest on or near the 
ground, and lay white eggs spotted with red. 

In their breeding-range these birds are Palasaretic, ranging from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific, one species beingknown even to cross Behring's 
Straits into Alaska. Several species extend their range further north 
than the limit of forest-growth. Those species which do not breed 
within the Palasaretic Eegion ascend the Himalayas until they reach an 
elevation where they can enjoy a Pahearctic climate. The southern 
winter range of the genus extends in Africa to the Cape of Good 
Hope, and in Asia to Ceylon and the islands of the Malay archipelago, 
but no species has as yet been found in Australia.

A. Bill broad at the base and rather 
flat, with 
well-developed rictal bristles, almost Muscicapine 
j upper mandible dark, under mandible 
paler. In unabraded plumage the greater 
wing-coverts have pale tips, forming a conspicuous 
bar across the wing; the median 
wing-coverts have also more or less distinct 
pale tips, forming an obscure upper wing-bar.

0-45 to 0*55 ; tarsus 0*8 to 0*7. 

Bummer plumage. The colour of the upper parts becomes greyer, 
the yellowish-green edges to the wing and tail-feathers almost disappear, 
the pale tips vanish, the bars across the wings become indistinct, 
and most of the yellow disappears from the underparts. 


Autumn plumage. Similar to the spring plumage in minor details, 
but yellower, the underparts being slightly suffused all over with 
pale greenish yellow. Eye-stripe pale greenish yellow. 


Winter plumage. Similar to the summer plumage, but slightly 
yellower. 


The Arctic AYilb^-Warbler breeds in the north of the Palsearctic 
Eegion from Pinmark, across Asia to Alaska, towards the northerly 
limit of forest-growth, and in a similar climate in the subalpine 
districts of South-eastern Siberia and Mongolia. It passes in <~ 
great numbers on migration in spring and autumn along the coast 
of China and Formosa, and winters in the islands of the Malay 
archipelago, Malacca, Tenasserim, and the South-Andaman islands. 
An accidental straggler has been shot on Heligoland.

Spring plumage. General colour of the upper parts olive, slightly 
yellower on the rump; eye-stripe well defined, narrow, yellowish 
white, extending to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the 
eye to the nape dark olive; wing-coverts olive, the median wing-
coverts with narrow, and the greater wing-coverts with broad 
yellowish-white tips, forming an obscure upper wing-bar and a 
conspicuous lower wing-bar; quills brown, narrowly tipped with 
greyish white, the outside web edged with green and emarginated 
as in the preceding species; tail-feathers brown, the outside web 
margined with green, and the inside web with a narrow well-
defined greyish-white margin. General colour of the underparts 
greenish yellow, greyer on the breast and flanks ; axillaries, under 
wing-coverts, and thighs pale yellow ; inner margin of quills greyish 
white. Bill Acrocephaline; upper mandible dark brown, under 
mandible pale. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Third and fourth 
primaries longest; second primary usually intermediate in length 
between the fifth and sixth, sometimes slightly shorter than the

sixth ; bastard primary measuring 0*5 to 0-0 inch. Length of wing, 
male 2*84 to 2-7 inches, female 2*7 to 2-0 ; tail, male 2*1. to 1*95, 
female 1*95 to 1-8 ; culmen 0*51 to 0-55 ; tarsus 0*8. 

The changes of plumage in this species are similar to those of ilio 
preceding species, but at all seasons of the year the general colour 
of the underparts is much paler in colour in P. boreal is (Blasius). 
The smaller size and smaller bastard primary of the latter species 
serve, however, to distinguish even birds of the year from the 
present species, though they approach each other very closely. 

Swinhoe's Willow-Warbler is said to breed in Kansu and Japan. 
It passes through South-east China on migration, and winters in 

Borneo.

tail-feathers brown, the outside webs margined with olive, and the 
inside webs, except those of the two centre feathers, having a narrow 
well-defined greyish-white margin. General colour of the unclerparts 
nearly white, greyer on the breast and flanks, and slightly 
suffused with yellow; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs 
pale yellow ; inner margin of quills greyish white. Bill Aerocephaline; 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale. Legs, 
feet, and claws bluish brown. Third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
longest; second primary generally intermediate in length between 
the seventh and eighth, in rare instances between the sixth 
and seventh; exposed portion of the bastard primary 05 to 065 
inch. Length of wing, male 2*5 to 2-3 inches, female 2*3 to 2*18; 
tail, male 2-05 to 1*9, female 1*9 to 1*8; culmen 045 to 0-5; 

tarsus 0*75. 

Summer plumage. The colour of the upper parts becomes greyer 
by abrasion, the pale tips to the quills are lost, the lower wing-bar 
becomes narrow and obscure, and nearly all trace of yellow on the 
underparts is abraded. 

Autumn plumage. Similar to the spring plumage, but having the 
eye-stripe, the wing-bar, and the underparts suffused with pale 
greenish yellow, causing the upper wing-bar to be very obscure. 

Winter plumage. The changes which take place by abrasion are 
similar to those which take place in summer. The wing-har is 
often entirely lost; but the underparts generally retain some of the 
greenish yellow. 

The Indian Willow-Warbler breeds in Casl~rlere, and winters in 
the plains of India. An example was obtained by Meves in the 
Ural mountains, and another on Heligoland by Ludwig Gratke.

This species differs from the preceding solely in having the median 
as well as the greater wing-coverts with pale tips. It appears to 
me to be a very doubtful species ; and if Severtzoff's Phyllopieuste 
intermedia should really prove to be an intermediate form between 
it and P. viridanus, Blyth, it will have to be degraded to the rank 
of a subspecies. I have not seen Severtzoff's types.

darker on the head, and shading into russet-brown on the rump; 
eye-stripe narrow, well defined, greyish white, extending well onto 
the nape ; lores and the feathers behind the eye dark olive-brown ; 
wing-coverts brown, the lesser coverts broadly edged with buffish 
brown, the median coverts paler at the tips, forming an obscure 
upper wing-bar, the greater coverts with broad bullish-white tips 
to the outer webs, forming a distinct lower wing-bar ; quills brown, 
narrowly tipped with buffish white, and edged on the outside webs 
with pale huffish brown, the sixth quill perceptibly emarginated as 
well as the preceding quills. Tail-feathers brown, the outside webs 
margined with pale buffish brown, and the inside webs with buffish 
white. General colour of the underparts white, shading into pale 
greyish buff on the breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts pale yellow; inner margin of quills pale 
buff. Bill slender, Acrocephaline; upper mandible dark brown, 
lower mandible pale. Legs, feet, and claws pale flesh-colour. Third,

1-9 to 1-8; culmon 0*5 ; tarsus 0*73. 

Summer plumage. Upper and underparts greyer; wing-bars more 
or less lost by abrasion ; the pale tips to the quills have disappeared. 

Autumn plumage. The olive-brown of the upper parts replaced 
by russet-brown; eye-stripe and underparts more suffused with 
buff. 

Winter plumage. Somewhat buffer than the summer plumage. 

The Pale-legged "Willow-Warbler is supposed to breed in Japan, 
to pass through China on migration, and to winter in the Burma 
peninsula. 

The British Museum does not possess a skin of this species. The 
type is in the Swinhoe collection in my possession, and other examples 
are in the collection of Allan Hume, Esq.

Spring plumage. General colour of the upper parts dark olive-
green, slightly darker on the head and somewhat greener on the 
rump ; eye-stripe well defined, pale yellowish white, extending 
to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye dark olive; 
wing-coverts brown, the lesser coverts broadly edged with olive, the 
median coverts paler at the tip, forming an indistinct upper wing-
bar, greater coverts with pale yellowish-white tips to the outer webs, 
forming a conspicuous lower wing-bar ; quills brown, the outer webs 
edged with olive-green and emarginated as far as the sixth; tail-
feathers brown, the outside webs margined with olive, and the inside 
webs, except those of the two centre feathers, with a narrow 
greyish-white margin. General colour of the underparts pale greyish 
yellow, greyest on the breast and flanks ; axillaries, under wing-
coverts, and thighs greyish yellow ; inner margin of quills pale buff. 
Bill Acrocepnaline, much decurved at the tip, with the rictal bristles 
well developed, approaching the Muscicapine type ; upper mandible 

dark brown, under mandible pale, darker towards the tip. Legs, 
feet, and claws bluish brown. Fourth and fifth primaries longest;

2-3 to 2*15, female 2*15 to 2*0; oilmen 0'55 to 0-6 ; tarsus 0-75. 

Summer plumage. In abraded plumage the general colour becomes 
slightly greyer, the greener margins to the quills are nearly lost, and 
seldom more than traces of the wing-bars remain. 

Autumn plumage. This scarcely differs from the spring plumage, 
except in having the eye-stripe somewhat yellower and the general 
colour of the undcrparts not quite so pale. 

Winter plumage. Similar to the summer plumage, but somewhat 
greener above and slightly yellower below. 

The Large-billed "Willow-Warbler appears to be almost exclusively 
an Indian species, breeding in Cashmere, and passing through the 
North-west Provinces on migration. In winter it is found sparingly 
near Calcutta and Lower Bengal, and is generally distributed over 
Western, Central, and Southern India as far south as Ceylon. On 
the eastern coast of the .Bay of Bengal it has been found as far as 
Chusan, and it has been obtained on the South-Andaman islands.

This species is very closely allied to the preceding, being absolutely 
identical in colour and in its seasonal changes of plumage, and 
would scarcely be entitled to specific rank were it not that it appears 
to have a more eastern geographical range. It is a slightly smaller 
bird, with a somewhat more rounded wing. The fourth and fifth 
primaries are longest, and the second primary is about equal to the 
tenth; exposed portion of bastard primary 0*7 to 0*8 inch. Length 
of wing, male 2-6 to 2*4 inches, female 2*4 to 2-25 ; tail, male 2-35 
to 2-0, female 2-0 to 1-85; culmen 0-45 to 0*5; tarsus 0*85 to 0*75.

side becomes broader, still more sharply defined, and almost pure 
white. General colour of the underparts greyish white, whitest 
on the centre of the belly, and more or less suffused with yellow 
throughout; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs bright 
yellow ; inner margin of quills huffish white. Bill Acrocephaline ; 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale. Legs, feet, and

Summer plumage. Greyer above and below, with the wing-bars 
more or less abraded. 
Autumn plumage. After the autumn moult, the olive-green of 
the upper parts is replaced by yellowish green, the eye-stripe and 
the wing-bars are a brighter yellow, and the underparts are still 
more suffused with yellow than they are in spring. 
Winter plumage. The changes produced by abrasion in winter are 
very similar to those produced in summer.

Spring plumage. General colour of the upper parts olive-green, 
slightly yellower on tlie ramp; eye-stripe pale greenish yellow, well-
defined, and extending well on to the nape ; an indistinct ill-defined 
pale mesial line on the crown; crown between the mesial line and 
the eye-stripes, lores, and transocular stripe dark olive, extending 
across the nape and sharply defined from the paler back; wingeoverts 
brown, edged externally with yellowish green ; the median 
wing-coverts with ill-defined pale tips, forming an obscure bar across 
the wing ; the greater wing-coverts with well-defined pale greenish-
white tips to the inside webs, forming a conspicuous lower wing-bar; 
quills brown, very narrowly tipped with greyish white, the outside 
webs edged with yellowish green and emarginatod as far as the 
sixth; tail-feathers brown, the outside webs margined with yellowish 
green, and the inside webs of the outside feathers white, 
sometimes extending over three outside feathers on each side, and 
occasionally including the shaft and the basal portion of the outside 
web. General colour of the underparts a uniform greyish white, 
slightly suffused all over with yellow; axillarics, under wing-

coverts, and thighs pale yellow; inner margin of quills huffish white. 
Bill Acrocephaline; upper mandible dark brown, under mandible 
pale. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Fourth and fifth primaries 
longest; second primary intermediate in length between the ninth 
and twelfth; the exposed part of the bastard primary measures 
0*55 to 0*7 inch. Length of wing, male 2-2 to 2*05 inches, female 
2-05 to 1-9 ; length of tail, male 1-85 to 1*7, female 1*7 to 1-55; 
length of culrnen 0*45 to 0-5. 

* The specific name of presbytis may possibly be the oldest name given to 
this bird; but since no description was published until Blyth described the 
types in the Leyclen Museum in 1870, it must give way to Blyth's earlier name 
of iriridypmnis, which dates from 1856. It is also doubtful whether the birds 
labelled Sylvia presbytis m the Leyden Museum are the types to which Muller 
gave the name of Muscicapa pretbytis, inasmuch as they are all marked with the 
locality of " Timor," and Muller (loo. cit.) only mentions the name as belonging 
to a bird which he obtained on Sumatra. 
54 TUEBIDiE. 

Simvmer pdumage. The pale edges i o the primaries are soon lost 
"by abrasion, the wing-bars become narrow and obscure, and the 
underparts lose much of their 3 ellow. 

Autumn 'plumage. After the autumn moult the underparts become 
pale primrose-yellow, except on the throat, which still shows 
much greyish white mixed with the yellow. 

Winter 2)1 umage. The yellow of the underparts below the breast 
is never quite lost by abrasion, though the eye-stripe and the remains 
of the wing-bars fade to nearly wrhite. 

Wallace's Crowned Willow-Warbler breeds in the mountains of 
British Burin a, and winters in the plains, ranging also as far as Timor 
and probably Sumatra.

with a trace of yellow on the flanks and the basal part of the under 
tail-feathers; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs yellow; 
inner margin of quills nearly white. Bill rather Acrocephaline for a 
typical Phylloscopus, dark brown; under mandible paler at the 
base. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Third primary longest; second 
sometimes longer, sometimes shorter than the fourth, always much 
longer than the fifth; bastard primary very small, the exposed part 
measuring 0*3 to 0-4 inch. Length of wing, male 3*1 to 2*8 inches, 
female 8*0 to 2*9 ; length of tail, male 2%25 to 2*0, female 1*95 to 
1*85; length of culmen 0*48 to 0*53. 

Summer plumage. Owing probably to the retiring habits of this 
species and the more limited range of its migration, and possibly to 
the firmer texture of its feathers, its plumage scarcely suitors at all 
from abrasion. 

Autumn and whiter plumage. Scarcely distinguishable from those 
of spring and summer. 

The Wood-Warbler, or Yellow Willow-Warbler, breeds in Central 
Europe, as far north as Inverness in Scotland, TJpsala in Sweden, 
St. Petersburg in Russia, and BogoslofTsk in the Ural. Its southern 
breeding-range is bounded to the west by Gibraltar, and eastwards 
as far south as Transylvania. It passes through Greece, Asia 
Minor, and Palestine on migration, and winters in North Africa, 
having been found to the west as far south as the Gold Coast, and 
to the cast as far south as Abyssinia. The most easterly locality 
recorded of this bird is Lankoran, on the south-western shore of the 
Caspian.

Sjpring plumage. General colour of the upper parts olive-green, 
somewhat yellower on the rump, each feather having an indistinct 
pale tip, which forms four pale mesial lines on the crown, and gives 
to the rest of the upper plumage a slightly mottled appearance; a 
somewhat indistinct greenish-yellow eye-stripe extends from the base 
of the bill as far as the crown; the feathers before the eye and 
behind the eye as far as the crown dark olive-green; wing-coverts 
olive, edged with olive-green; quills brown, narrowly tipped with 
greyish white, the outside webs edged with yellowish green and 
emarginated as far as the fifth; tail-feathers brown, the outside 
webs edged with yellowish green, and the inside webs with a 
narrow greyish-white margin. General colour of the underparts 
white, suffused all over with yellow, and on the breast and flanks with 
buff; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs yellow ; inner 
margin of quills very pale huffish white. Bill (typically Phylloscopine) 
narrow, depressed, and slender ; upper mandible dark brown, 
under mandible very slightly paler. Legs, feet, and claws brown. 
Third and fourth primaries longest; second primary intermediate 
in length between the fifth and sixth ; bastard primary somewhat

variable, the exposed part in males occasionally measures 0-63 inch, 
is usually 0*6, and in raro instances as small as 0*48 ; in females 0*6 
is exceptionally large, 0*5 is usual, and 0*38 exceptionally small. 
Length of wing, male 2*83 to 2-65 inches, female 2-iSo to 2-45 ; length 
of tail, male 2*3 to 2*1, female 2-1 to 1-88 ; length of culmen 0-4 to 0*5. 

/Summer plumage. Upper parts greyer, in high latitudes occasionally 
with all the yellow and green abraded, leaving the general 
colour earthy brown, the eye-stripe having faded into greyish white. 
The pale tips to the feathers of the crown always lost, and those to 
the quills generally so. Much of the yellow of the underparts also 
becomes abraded, and in high latitudes all except that on the axillaries 
and under wing-coverts, leaving the huffish yellow of the 
breast and flanks pale grey. 

Autumn plumage similar to the spring plumage in minor details, 
but yellower, and without the pale tips to the feathers of the crown. 
Birds of the year are even more yellow than adults, the whole of 
the underparts being uniform huffish yellow. 

Winter plumage. Similar to the summer plumage, but yellower. 

The Willow-Warbler breeds throughout Northern and Central 
Europe, extending its range in the west of Southern Europe as far 
as Gibraltar, and in the east as far as Transylvania. In Asia it 
breeds throughout the pine-regions of Siberia as far east as the 
valley of the Yenesay. It winters in North, Central, and Southeastern 
Persia, in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, and North Africa ; 
but 1 have not seen skins from all these localities. That it winters 
in South Africa, from the Transvaal to the Cape, the fine series of 
skins in the Museum abundantly proves.

and paler; tail-feathers brown, the outside webs edged with yellowish 
green, and the inside webs with a narrow greyish-white 
margin. General colour of the underparts pure white, suffused 
with huffish yellow on the chin and throat, and with pale yellow on

yellow; inner margin of quills greyish white. Bill Phylloscopine; 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale brown, darker at 
the tip. Legs, feet, and claws light brown. Third and fouith primaries 
longest; second primary sometimes intermediate in length 
between the fifth and sixth, sometimes between the sixth and 
seventh ; exposed part of the bastard primary measures 0*5 to 0*6

secondaries become narrower. 
Autumn plumage unknown. 
Bonelli's Willow-Warbler breeds on both shores of the Mediterranean, 
extending northwards into Northern France, and eastwards 
into Palestine • winters in Senegal, the oases of North Africa, 
and Nubia.

than the Whitethroat by this name ; and under no circumstance can the name

to which he applied it. (Conf. Seebohm, 'Ibis,' 1879, p.432.)

Spring plumage. General colour of the upper parts olive-green, 
slightly yellower on the rump; eye-stripe somewhat ill-defined, 
greyish white, with a shade of yellow, and extending only a short 
distance behind the eye; lores and the feathers behind the eye 
olive; wing-coverts and quills brown, edged on the outside webs 
with olive-green, and emarginatod as far as the sixth; quills narrowly 
tipped with white; tail-feathers brown, the outside webs 
edged with yellowish green, and the inside webs with a narrow 
greyish-white margin. General colour of the underparts white, 
shading into grey on the breast and flanks, and more or less suffused 
all over with yellow; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs 
yellow; inner margin of quills very pale huffish white. Bill Phylloscopine; 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible scarcely 
paler. Legs, feet, and claws dark brown, approaching black. Third 
and fourth primaries longest, second piimary sometimes intermediate 

in length between the sixth and seventh, usually between the 
seventh and eighth, and in rare instances between the eighth and 
ninth; the exposed part of the bastard primary measures 0*5 
to 0-05 inch. Length of wing, male 2'5o to 2-25 inches, female 2-3 
to 1*95; length of tail, male 2-2 to 2-0, female 2-0 to 1-7; length 
of culmen 0*4 to 0*45. 

Summer plumage. This species suffers considerably from abrasion 
during the perils of migration. The upper parts fade into 
olive-grey, the eye-stripe and underparts lose some of their yellow, 
and the pale tips to the quills disappear. 

Autumn plumage. After the autumn moult the whole of the 
plumage becomes suffused with huffish yellow, which is almost pure 
pale buff on the eye-stripe, breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts. 

Winter plumage. The huffish yellow pervading the whole of the 
autumn plumage is never entirely lost by abrasion in winter. 

The Chiffchaff, or Ohiffchaff Willow-Warbler, breeds in the temperate 
regions of Europe almost up to the Arctic Circle, and winters 
on both shores of the Mediterranean, the southern limit of its winter 
range being Abyssinia.

Spring plumage. General colour of the upper parts earthy brown, 
very slightly suffused with yellowish green on the rump; eye-
stripe buffi&h white, narrow, tolerably well-defined, scarcely reaching 
to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye dark earthy 
brown; wing-coverts brown, with slightly paler margins; quills 
brown, showing traces of yellowish green on the outside edges, 
and cmarginated as far as the sixth quill; tail-feathers brown, 
showing traces of yellowish green on the outside webs, and narrowly 
margined with greyish white on the inside webs. General colour of 
the underparts neaily white, shading into pale buff on the breast, 
flanks, and thighs; axillaries and under wing-coverts yellow; 
inner margin of quills very pale huffish white. Bill Ph\ Uoseopine, 
both mandibles dark brown. Legs, feet, and claws nearly black. 
Third and fourth primaries longest; second primary equal to the 
seventh, or slightly shorter; the exposed part of the bastard 
primary 0-5 to 0*05 inch. Length of wing, male 2*58 to 2*33 
inches, female 2-25 to 2*1; length of tail, male 2*3 to 2*2, female 2*0 
to 1-9 ; length of culmen 0*45 to 0*48. 
Summer plumage. The slight traces of yellowish green on the 
outside web of the wing- and tail-feathers are soon lost by 
abrasion. The underparts and the eye-stripe lose some of their 
buff and become whiter, and, in very rare instances, the -yellow on 
the axillaries and under wing-coverts almost disappears. 
Autumn plumage. Yery similar to the spring plumage, but with 
the buff on the eye-stripe and underparts more developed. 
Winter plumage. The abrasion which takes place during winter 
is somewhat less than is usually the case in summer. 
The Siberian Willow-Warbler, or Siberian Chifichaff, breeds in the 
valleys of the Petchora, the Obb, and the Yenesay, extending 
northwards beyond the limit of forest-growth, and southwards as 
far as Perm in the west and Yenasaisk in the east. It passes 
across the Kirghiz steppes and Turkestan on migration, and winters 
in Ealuchibtan and the plains of India. It also breeds abundantly 
in Cashmere and in the mountains near Lake Baical.

This species appears to be subject to little or no seasonal change 
of plumage; nor does the slight abrasion of the feathers which 
takes place in summer make any appreciable change in the appearance 
of the bird. 

The general colour of the upper parts is olive-brown, very 
slightly darker on the head; eye-stripe deep yellow, paler at the 
nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye olive-brown; wings 

* No doubt a typical error for affinis.

Bering plumage. General colour of the upper parts olive-green, 
yellower on the rump and upper tail-coverts; a well-defined, 
narrow, greenish-yellow eye-stripe extends from the "base of the 
"bill to the nape; an irregular and very obscure greenish-yellow 
mesial line extends from the forehead to the nape; the feathers 
before the eye, and behind the eye to the nape and the crown, and 
nape between the mesial lino and each eye-stripe dark olive-green ; 
a few still darker feathers emphasizing the eye-stripe on the nape; 
wing-coverts brown, the lesser wing-coverts with broad olive-green 
margins, the median and greater wing-coverts with broad, well 
defined, greenish-yellow tips, forming two conspicuous bars across 
each wing; quills brown, all the secondaries and four or five of 
the primaries with conspicuous well defined yellowish-white tips; 
outside webs of the quills margined with yellowish green fading 
into yellowish, white, and becoming broad and conspicuous on the 
terminal half of the innermost secondaries; quills emarginatcd as 
far as the sixth; tail-feathers brown, the outside webs edged 
with yellowish green, and the inside webs with a narrow greyish-
white margin. General colour of the underparts white, suffused all 
over with traces of yellowish green; axillaries yellow ; under wTingcoverts 
and thighs greyish yellow; inner margins of quills nearly 
white. Bill slender, Phylloscopine ; both mandibles dark brown, the 
tinder mandible somewhat paler at the base. Legs, feet, and claws 
brown. Third, fourth, and fifth primaries longest; second primary 
generally intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh, 
very rarely between the seventh and eighth ; the exposed part of the 
bastard primary measures 0 5 to 0*55 inch. Length of wing, male 
2*35 to ^*15 inches, female 2*15 to 2*0 ; length of tail, male 1-85 to 
1-7, female 1*7 to 1-55 ; length of culmen 04. 
Summer plumage. Nearly all the yellow and green with which 
both the upper and under parts were suffused has been lost by 
abrasion; the upper parts have faded into a grey-olive, traces only 
of the yellowish green remaining on the rump, upper tail-coverts, 
and the edges of the wing and tail-feathers ; all trace of yellow 
has gone from the eye-stripe and wing-bars, and nearly all from 
the underparts, leaving the colour greyish white ; the conspicuous 
pale tips to the secondaries and some of the primaries have generally 
entirely disappeared, the lower wing-bar and the pale edges 
to the innermost secondaries have become very narrow, and traces 
only of the upper wing-bar are left. 
Autumn plumage. Similar to the spring plumage, but more 
brilliant, the eye-stripe and the wing-bars yellower, and the upper 
parts a yellower green; the mesial line on the crown remains as 
obscure, and the underparts scarcely yellower. 
Winter plumage. The same amount of abrasion takes place as in 
summer, but the upper parts do not become so grey, and the eye-
stripe and wing-bars retain a trace of yellow.

The plumage of this species is subject to very little seasonal 
change. The pale tips to the quills are so obscure that their loss 
by abrasion scarcely alters the appearance of the bird. In very 
abraded skins the pale tips to the innermost secondaries become 
lost or obscure, and the broad orange-yellow tips to the greater 
wing-coverts become dull and narrow. 

In full plumage the general colour of the upper parts is yellowish 

* The synonymy of this bird is somewhat intricate. Hodgson confused it 
•with P.pror(guh($(Pixl\.). Both specie are represented in the British Museum 
amongst the types of " Ahromia chlorowopits yel Beguhis modesfus auct.," the 
skins of both species being numt ered " 839." No. 839 is on plate 57 in the 
first volume of Hodgson's ' Drawings of Birds of Nepal in the Briti&h Museum.' 
Pig. 5 on this plate undoubtedly represents P*$roregulu& (Pall.), without the 
grey on the head and throat and without the white on the inside webs of the 
two outside tail-feathers of P. macidij e?ims, Blyth. Toe figure bears the name 
"•AbromLs chloronotus, no. 839. Reg. modfstus auct.? " 
In the Appendix to Hodgson's' Drawings of Birds of Nepal in the British 
Museum,' plate 45, are two figures undoubtedly representing P. maculypennis, 
Blyth, showing the gi'ey on the head and the white inside webs of the outside 
tail-feathers. These figures are also numbered u839." 

Inasmuch as neither Hodgson nor Gray published any description of this 
species, and since it is clear that Hodgson confounded it with the following 
one, and that consequently his name has been frequently applied to both 
species, it seems to me perfectly clear that his name must be reieefced in favour 
of that of Blyth.

green, the feathers of the rump, which are much developed, ending 
in a broad band of deep yellow, which conceals the olive-green 
upper tail-eoverts. The head, nape, and hind neck, the lores, and 
the space behind the eye to the nape are dark olive-brown ; a well-
defined pale buff eye-stripe reaches from the base of the bill to the 
nape; an irregular, pale buff mesial line on the crown reaches from 
the forehead to the nape. Wing-coverts brown, the lesser wing-
coverts with broad yellowish-green margins; the median wing-
coverts tipped with deep yellow, forming a narrow upper bar across 
the wings • and the greater wing-coverts more broadly tipped with 
the same colour, forming a well-defined, broad, conspicuous, deep-
yellow lower bar across the wings ; quills brown, edged on the 
outside web with yellowish green, and einargiiuted as far as the 
sixth- innermost secondaries with a well-defined yellowish-white 
terminal spot on the outer web. Tail-feathers brown, the outside 
webs margined with yellowish green ; two, and frequently three, 
outside feathers on each side pure white, including their shafts, 
with the terminal third part of the outer web brown, and the basal 
third part of the outer web yellow. Underparts from the bill down* 
to the breast greyish white; below, including the axillaries and 
under wing-coverts, greyish yellow, brightest in the centre of the 
"belly ; inner margin of quills nearly white. Bill slender, Phylloscopine, 
both mandibles dark brown. Legs, feet, and claws brown. 

•Fourth, and fifth primaries longest; second primary about equal to 
the tenth* bastard primary nearly half the length of the second 
primary, the exposed part measuring 0*5 to 0*55 inch. Length of 
wing 2*0 to 1*8 inches, tail 1*6 to 1*35. culmen 0*35 to 0*4. 
Hodgson's Barred Willow-Warbler probably breeds in the pine-
districts of the Himalayas, in Nepal and Sikkim, coming down into 
the valleys during the cold season.

wing-coverts with broad well-defined bright-yellow tips, forming 
two conspicuous bars across each wing; quills brown, with very 
narrow white tips ; outbide edge of the quills margined with yellowish 
green, becoming broader and jjaler on the terminal half of 
the innermost secondaries• quills emarginated as far as the sixth; 
tail-feathers brown, the outside webs margined with yellowish

There appears to be little or no variation between spring and 
autumn plumage of this species; nor are the effects of abrasion 
apparent beyond the narrowing of the wing-bar and the lessening 
of the pale tips of the secondaries. 

In full plumage the general colour of the upper parts is dark 
green, the feathers on the rump, which are much developed, having 
a broad yellowish-green terminal band concealing the dark-green 
upper tail-coverts; crown between the eye-stripes, lores, and the 
feathers behind the eye to the nape dark olive-green; eye-stripe 
pale huffish green, not very well defined, and extending to the nape; 
mesial line on the crown nearly obsolete; wing-coverts brown, 
the lesser coverts with broad green margins, the median coverts with 
green tips, forming an obscure upper wing-bar; greater coverts 
with broad well-defined orange tips, forming a conspicuous lower 
wing-bar; quills brown, on the outside web margined with green 
fading into yellowish white, and becoming broad and conspicuous 
on the terminal portion of the innermost secondaries; quills emar

ginatcd as far as the sixth; tail-feathors brown, the outside webs 
margined with green, and the inside webs and shafts of the three 
outer feathers on each side pure white, the outside web of these 
feathers being brown on the terminal half, and white tinged with 
greenish yellow on the basal half. General colour of the underparts 
dull greenish yellow, biightest on the centre of the belly; inner 
margin of quills nearly white. Bill slender, Phylloscopine; both 
mandibles dark brown, the under mandible paler at the ^ase. Legs, 
feet, and claws brown. Eourth, fifth, and sixth primaries longest; 
second primary about equal to the tenth ; the exposed part of the 
bastard primary measures 0*55 to 0*65 inch. Length of wing, male 
2-45 to 2-3, female 2-25 to 2*1 inches; length of tail, male 2*0

The genus Hypolais is a small group of birds chiefly remarkable 
for laying eggs having a french-grey or salmon-coloured ground. 
They form the connecting link between Phylloscopus and Acrocephalus, 
having the nearly even tail of the foirner and the large bill 
of the latter. From the large-billed subgeneric group of the former 
(Acanthopneustes), besides the difference of the coloration of the eggs, 
already alluded to, they can only be distinguished by the absence of 
the pale tips to the wing-coverts, which in Acanthopneustes form one, 
and often twTo pale bars across the wings. 

All the species of this genus appear to be more or less migratory. 

* This writer, as well as others, spells the word erroneously Hipjpolais, under 
a mistaken idea of its derivation.

TTTODID-aS. 

They moult twice in the year ; and the young birds are scarcely to 

be distinguished from adults. With the exception of one species, 

which, for reasons hereafter given, I have divided into &Ye sub


species, there is in no one species any great variation of size; nor 

does there appear to be any constant difference in size between the 

sexes. In every species the tarsus is scutellated in front. 

All the species of this genus have considerable powers of song. 

The basin of the Mediterranean appears to be the centre of distribution 
of this genus—one or two species extending their range 
more to the east, one of them as far as Lake Baical.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts, including* the lores, ear-coverts, and the sides of the 
neck, is olive-green; a somewhat indistinct greenish-yellow eye-
stripe extends from the base of the bill, losing itself behind the eye ; 
the quills are brown, narrowly edged and somewhat more broadly 
tipped with greenish white; the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries 
are still more broadly edged with browner white; tail-
feathers brown, with very narrow pale edges, and generally with 
very indistinct traces of transverse bars. The underparts, including 
the axillaries, are uniform greenish yellow, many of the feathers on 
the thighs and under wing-coverts having brown centres ; inner 
margin of quills pale grey. Bill Acrocephaline ; upper mandible dark 
brown, under mandible pale horn-colour; rictal bribtles moderately 
developed. Wing with the third primary very slightly longer 
than the fourth, and the second primary generally intermediate in 
length between the fourth and filth, in very rare instances equal to 
or slightly shorter than the fifth ; bastard primary narrow and 
pointed, generally falling short of the primary-coverts 0*1 inch, but 
in birds of the year occasionally extending 0-05 inch beyond them. 

Legs, feet, and claws bluish grey. Length of wing 3'2 to 2-9 inches, 
tail 2-25 to 2-0, culmen 0*6(j to 0-59, tarsus 0-8. Tail nearly even. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn 
moult the olive-green of the upper parts is slightly greyer, and the 
greenish yellow of the underparts paler and less green. Birds of 
the year scarcely differ from adults in autumn plumage. 

The Icterine Tree-Warbler breeds in Central and Northern 
Europe, from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, extending northwards 
as far as the Arctic circle. In England it is only an accidental 
visitor. It passes through South Europe and North Africa on 
migration, and winters in South Africa (Damara Land, Ovampo,&c).

slightly smaller, with a slightly different wing-formula. The general 
colour both of the upper and underparts is less brilliant, being 
slightly suffused with buff; and the legs, feet, and claws are pale 
brown. Wing with the third primary very slightly longer than the 
fourth, and the second primary generally intermediate between the 
sixth and seventh, in very rare instances a trine longer than the

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts, including the lores, ear-coverts, and the sides of the 
neck, is brownish-grey slightly tinged with olive, especially on the 
rump and upper tail-coverts; a very indistinct eye-stripe extends 
from the base of the bill, but can rarely be traced behind the eye ; 
the quills are brown, narrowly tipped and edged with greyish white; 
the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries are more broadly edged 
with greyer white; tail-feathers brown, the outer feathers with 
broad and tolerably well-defined greyish-white margins broadest at 
the tip, gradually diminishing on the succeeding feathers until they 
are lost entirely on the two centre ones; very indistinct traces of 
transverse bars generally observable on the tail-feathers. The 
undcrparts are pale buffish white, shading into nearly pure white 
on the chin, throat, and the centre of the belly, and into pale grey 
on the flanks; auxiliaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs buffish. 
white, shading into pale-grey on the centres of the feathers; inner 
margin of quills very pale buff. Bill Acrocepkaline; upper mandible 
dark brown, under mandible pale horn-colour; rictal bristles 
small. "Wing with the third primary longest, and the second inter


mediate in length between the fourth and fifth, in rare instances 
equal to the fourth; bastard primary very narrow and pointed, 
falling short of the primary-coverts by Q'2 to 0*25 inch. Legs, feet, 
and claws dark bluish grey. Length of wing 3*45 to 3*3 inches, tail 
2*75 to 2*6, culmen 0*78 to 0-7, tarsus 0*95 to 0*85; oatside tail-
feathers 0*15 to 0-2 shorter than the longest. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn moult 
the general colour of the undcrparts is greyer. Birds of the year 
scarcely differ from adults in autumn plumage. 

The Olive Tree-Warbler is a late summer migrant to Greece, Asia 
Minor, and Palestine. It also breeds in Algeria. Its winter 
quarters are unknown; but a solitary example has been oMained in 
Egypt, and a second in Abyssinia, whence we may infer ^hat they 
are somewhere in Central Africa.

In tlie adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts, including the lower ear-coverts and hides of the neck, is 
brownibh grey; a very indistinct eve-stripe extends from the base 
of the bill, and can occasionally be traced behind the eye ; the 
quills are brown, narrowly tipped and edged with greyish white; 
the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries are more bioadly edgul 
with greyer white; tail-feathers bro\\n, narrowly margined with 
greyish white, outside feathers broadly tipped with white, the 
w7hite tips gradually becoming narrower until they are lost altogether 
on the two centre featheis; very indistinct traces of transverse 
bars generally observable on the tail-featkeis. The underpays 
are ] ale huffish white, shading into nearly pure white on the 
chin, tkroat, and centre of the belly, and into \ ale hi own on the 
flanks; axillaiies, under wing-coveits, and thighs huffish white; 
inner margin of quills very pale brown. Bill Acroocphaline ; upper 
mandible dark brown, under mandible pale horn-colour; rictal bristles 
small. "Wing with the thiid and fourth primaiics nearly equal and 
longest, and the second intermediate in length between the fifth and 
sixth,in rare instances equal to the sixth; bastard piimary narrow 
and generally pointed, usually falling short of the primary-coverts 
by at least -05 inch, but occasionally extending that distance beyond 
them. Legs, feet, and claws dark brown. Length of wing 3*05 
to 2-8 inches, tail 2-6 to 2-4, culmen 0-7 to 0*0, tarsus 0*85; 
outside tail-feathers 0*15 shorter than the longest. 

The female scarcely diffois from the male. After the, autumn 
moult the faded summer dress is replaced by a plumage scarcely 
differing from that of spring. It is not known that birds of the 
year present any peculiarities of plumage. 

UpeherVIree Waibier breeds in Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Northern 
Abyssinia, South-eastern Persia, Baluchistan, and Turkestan. It 
is noli known whether its migrations extend beyond leaving the 
mountains, where it has been found up to an elevation of 5000 
feet, for the plains. In Turkestan it is certainly only a summer 

visitor.

Hypolais opaca, Hypolais pallida, Hypolais rania, Hypolais 
caligata, and Hypolais obsoleta. 

This is a very puzzling group of birds. An unbroken series may 
be found from the largest H. opaca from Spain, through the smaller 
II pallida from Greece and Asia Minor, and the still smaller 
II pallida and //. rama from Persia, down to the small skins of 
If. rama from India and the still smaller II. caligata from Turkestan 
and India, which latter become paler in colour where they live in 
the more sandy districts and become the form known as H. obsoleta. 
Under these circumstances I see no alternative but to regard the 
brown-coloured species of Hypolais as a most interesting example 
of a species in the process of breaking up into several species. 

H. olivetoram has obviously become perfectly differentiated and has 
long ago ceased to intermarry with the inferior caste. H, languida 
has apparently only just succeeded in isolating itself; but I am not 
sure that in a large enough series of this rare bird intermediate 
forms might not occur between it and H. pallida. The other 
supposed species can only be considered distinct from each other 
on the theory that in intermediate localities they habitually 
hybridize. 
The synonymy of the Central and widest spread form is as 
follows:—

This species is of precisely the same colour as the preceding, and 
differs from it only in being a slightly smaller bird with a somewhat 
longer bastard primary. Possibly the legs and feet may be a shade 
paler in colour. 3No difference is observable in the .shape or colour 
of the bill, or in the rietal bristles. The wing formula is the same, 
but the bastard primary is always longer than the primary-coverts, 
extending beyond them from 0*L to 0*3 inch. Length of wing 2*75 
to 2-5 inches, tail 2*20 to 2*0, culmen 0*7 to 0*0, tarsus 0*9 to 0*8; 
outside tail-feathers 0*15 inch shorter than the longest. 

There are no apparent differences of age, sex, or season beyond 
those of the usual fading of colour and abrasion of the edges of the 
feathers, which takes place during summer and winter. 

The Olivaceous Tree-Warbler is a regular summer visitor to 
Palestine, Greece, Asia Minor, and probably Italy. Its breeding-
range extends eastwards through Persia to Turkestan, and southwards 
through Egypt to Abyssinia. Its winter quarters appear to 
be unknown.

I am unable to detect the slightest difference In colour between 
this bird and the one previously described, of which I consider it to 
be a Western form. On an average it Is certainly a larger bird, 
with a wider and less laterally depressed bill; but small skins from 
Spain are indistinguishable from large skins from Asia Minor. 

The wiug formula of the subspecies under consideration does not 
differ from that of the two previously described birds, and the 
bastard primary extends beyond the primary-coverts from 0*2 to 0*32 
inch. Length of wing 2*75 to 2-6 inches, tail 2*3 to 2*15, culmen 
0-71 to 0-05, tarsus 0*9; outside tail-feathers 0*2 inch shorter 
than the longest. 

I have been unable to discover any differences in the plumage 
attributable to age, sex, or season, beyond that of summer and 
winter abrasions. 

The "Western Olivaceous Tree-Warbler is a regular summer visitor

bird, with a shorter second primary and a longer bastard primary. 
The third, fourth, and fifth primaries are nearly equal and Jongost;

This subspecies is slightly smaller than the preceding, but with 
the longer second primary and the shorter bastard*primary of the 
more western races. 

In colour it does not differ from the bird last mentioned. The 
third, fourth, and fifth primaries are nearly equal and longest; the 
second primary is usually intermediate in length between the sixth 
and seventh, but it is frequently only as long as, and occasionally 
shorter than, the seventh ; the bastard piimary exceeds the primarvcoverts 
by 0-26 to 0-15 inch. Length of wing- 2-38 to 2-28 inches, 
tail 1-95 to 1-8, culmen 0*51 to 0*5, tarsus 0-85; outside tail-
feathers 0*1 to 1-5 inch shorter than the longest. 


The slight changes of plumage in this subspecies are the same as 
those of the preceding.

brown or pale isabelline brown. In other respects the coloration is 
the same as that of the two or three preceding subspecies. The 
third and fourth primaries are nearly equal and longest; the second 
primary in a skin from Turkestan is intermediate in length between 
the sixth and the seventh, and in one from Scinde between the 
seventh and eighth ; the bastard primary exceeds the primary-coverts 
by 0*35 inch in both skins. Length of wing 2*4 inches, tail 2-0 ;

So far as is known the Desert Tree-Warbler is confined to the 
sandy regions of Turkestan in summer, and to those of Scinde in 
winter. The only skins I have seen are the type of Salicaria

Bill of Acrocephalus streperus. 

The genus Acrocejplialus comprises a well-marked group of birds 
familiarly known as Eeed-Warblers, and is distinguished by the 
possession of a very minute bastard primary and a moderately 
rounded tail. The bastard primary is so minute that in adult birds 
it does not usually extend as far as the primary-coverts. In birds 
of the year, and in one or two species slightly aberrant in this 
respect, it is usually somewhat longer, occasionally extending 
beyond them. 

The bill is typically large, depressed and broad at the base, with 

TUJIDID2G. 

moderately developed rictal bristles. In two of tlie species the bill 
is somewhat aberrant, beiiii>* as slender as in the genus LoaiHtdla. 
These two species are also distinguished by a different style of 
colouring, each feather on the head and baek being darker in the 
centre. The existence of two other intermediate species makes it, 
however, advisable not to separate them more than subgenerieally 
from the hpicd Acrocephali. 

The tail is more rounded than in Hypolais, and much more so 
than in PJii/lloscopiix, but not so much so as in LocusUlla, the outside 
tail-feathers being longer than the under tail-coverts. 

The general colour of the plumage is a more or less uniform 
brown, sometimes olive-brown, sometimes russet-brown, gradually 
fading, as the plumage becomes abraded, into a neutral brown or 
dust-brown, not inaptly described as-»m$ji«« colour. 

Most of these biids are migiatory, and moult twice in the year, 
shortly before each journey. Their breeding-range extends over 
the whole of* rhe central and southern Paraparetic Eegion, but only 
one species extends as far north "is the Arctic Circle. They winter 
in the tropical regions of Africa and Asia, and are especially common 
in the islands of the Malay archipelago. Two species apparently 
migrate south instead of north to bleed, and resort- to the swamps 
of Australia for that purpose. Two other species appear to be 
non-migratory—one having found a peimanent home in South 
Africa, and the other in the Caroline Islands in the Pacific.

* The Aquatic Warbler has by no means a clear title to its name. Scopoli'? 
bird may have been either a Sedge-Warbler or an Aquatic Warbler; but his 
description is inconsistent with either of them. Neither Gmelin nor Latham, 
appear to ha\e known the bird, but have simply copied Scopoli Bechstein, 
Mever and Wolf, and Naumann were woll acquainted with the bird, but identified 
it, probably incorrectly, with the Mo+aci la bahcaria of Liimeeus, a name 
which has been transferred'from one species to another, until it has long ago

Tli e general colour of the upper parts is a pale tawny brown; 
eye-strip e very distinct, greyish white, and extending almost to the 
nap e ; lores and the feathers behind the eye russet-brown; over 
eacli. eye-stripe a broad very dark-brown streak passes to the nape, 
leavin g a narrow mesial line on the crown; each feather of the

the fir-st writer to use the name aquatica to a clearly defined species ; and since 
his nam e has been in general use, and has not been extensively, if at all, applied 
to aia y other species in the genus, we are, in mj opinion, justified in calling the 
Aqxa-atic Warbler Acrocephalus aquaticus (Teinm.), consigning the Motacilla 
aq^€tt%ca of Gnielm, and the Sylvia aquatica of Latham, beyond the Umbo of 
synonyms to the lethe of pre-Linnsean oblivion.

secondaries, and tail, has a more or less distinct dark-brown centre, 
the quill-feathers only being uniform brown. In abraded summer 
plumage the underparts are nearly white, buffer on the throat and 
flanks in spring, and more or less suffused all over with buff in 
autumn. In many skins the lower throat and flanks are striated ; 
in this plumage they are the A. cariceti of JNaumann ; these striations 
occur both in birds shot in abraded breeding-plumage and in the 
fulvous plumage after the autumn moult. Most ornithologists 
ascribe the striated underparts to the adult plumage, and the unstriated 
to birds of the year; but I have not been able to obtain a 
sufficient series of skins to satisfy myself of the truth of such an 
exceptional change. The bill is Locustelline and the rictal bristles 
only slightly developed ; the upper mandible is dark and the under 
mandible pale. Legs, feet, and claws pale horn-colour. Length 
of wing 2-D to 2-35 inches, tail 2-0 to 1-8, culmen 0*52 to 0*49. 
Second primary equal to or nearly equal to the third. 

The Aquatic Reed-Warbler breeds in Central and Southern 
Europe from the Atlantic to the Ural Mountains, also in North 
Africa. Its winter quarters are unknown, but are doubtless in some 
part of the African continent.

* In my opinion no possible good can arise, and much confusion must be 
caused, by rejecting the name in common use for the Sedge-Warbler, which 
was "well defined by Bechstein, in favour of the ill-defined name supposed to 
have been given to it by Linnaeus. I admit that the evidence of the ' Fauna 
Suecica' leaves little room for doubt that Linnseus intended to describe the 
Sed<*e-Warbler, but his description was so bad that it met with the neglect 
that it deserved.

The general colour of the inyper parts is russet-brown, each feather 
having an obscure dark centre. These dark centres are most 
conspicuous, becoming neaily black on the head, wing-coverts, and 
innermost secondaries, and disappear altogether on the rump, which 

4 . ACROCKPIIILTJS. 
is very tawny ; eye-stripe very distinct, huffish white, not extending 
to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye russet-brown; 
wings and tail-feathers brown, the margins of the outside- webs 
edged with russet-brown. The underparts huffish white, darkest on 
the breast and Hanks. After the autumn moult the eye-stripe and 
the underparts are still more suffused with buff. After both moults, 
but especially in spring, the whitish tips to the quills are very conspicuous, 
but these are soon lost by abrasion. Bill Locustelline, but 
the rictal bristles fairly developed; upper mandible dark, under 
mandible pale. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of 
wing 2*7 to 2-4 inches, tail 2*15 to 1*9, oilmen 0*6 to 0*5. Second 
primary equal to or a trifle shorter than the third. 

The Sedge-Warbler, or Sedge Heed-Warbler, breeds throughout 
Europe and Siberia at least as far east as the Yenesay ; its northern 
range extends slightly north of the Arctic Circle. It winters in 

South Africa.

The general colour of the upper parts is russet-brown, each 

feather with an obscure dark centre, most fulvous on the rump and 

upper tail-coverts and the margins of the outside webs of the quills 

and tail-feathers; the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries are 

very dark brown, edged externally with huffish white; eye-stripe 

distinct baffish white, scarcely extending to the nape• lores and 

the feathers behind the eye russet-brown• over each eye-stripe a 

narrow dark band, well defined next the eye-stripes, but gradually 

fading into the brown of the crown. Underparts fulvous white, 

darkest on the flanks and thighs. The bill is intermediate between 

Acrocephalus and Locustella; upper mandible dark, under mandible 

pale. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 2*3 inches, tail 

1*75, culmen 0*0. Third and fourth primaries equal and longest; 

second primary intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh. 

tSwinhoe's Reed-Warbler has only been found in South China, 

where it is supposed to breed. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species, 

which is only known from the type in the Swinhoe collection in 

my possession. It was obtained at Amoy on the 20th of May, 1861.

The general colour of the upper parts is russet-brown, slightly 
greyer on the head, quills, and tail, and most rufous on the rump 
and upper tail-coverts and the margins of the outside webs of the 
quills and tail-feathers; the eye-stripe is narrow, greyish white, very 
distinct, but not extending as far as the nape ; when fresh moulted 
the quills and tail-feathers have narrow pale edges at and near the 
tips, which are soon lost by abrasion; the wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries gradually become paler towards the edge on their outside 
webs * lores and the feathers behind the eye russet-brown ; over 
each eye-stripe a broad dark-brown band, abruptly defined over each 
eye-stripe, and gradually fading into the brown of the crown of the 
head. The breast and flanks are pale rufous-brown, shading into 
pale buff on the centre of the belly and under tail-coverts, and into 
nearly white on the throat and chin ; the axillaries, thighs, under 
wing-coverts, and the inner edging of the quills are pale brownish

buff. The bill is Locustelliue, but the rictal bristles are fairly developed 
; the upper mandible is dark, the under mandible pale. The 
legs, feet, and claws arc pale horn-colour. Length of wing 2-2 to 
2-1 inches, tail 2-1 to 1-85, culmen 0*8 to 0-52. Third and fourth 
primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary generally 
intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh, occasionally 
between the seventh and eighth; bastard primary exceeding the 
primary-coverts by 0-15 to 0*25 inch. 

After the autumn moult both the upper and under parts are more 
rufous than in spring; and in winter, and especially in summer, 
much of the rufous coloration is lost by abrasion. 

Schrcnck's Eeed-Warbler breeds in the valley of the Amoor, and 
has been taken frequently in Japan, where it probably also breeds. 
It passes through China on migration, and has been found wintering 
in the Tenasserim Provinces.

* I have retained the name in common use for the Gireat Beert-Warbler, 
contrary to the rules of the British Association, because it is the name in 
common rise. Acrocephalus arundinaceus (Linn.) may be rejected under the 
rules, because, in placing the species under the genus Turdus, the definition 
became so misleading as" to admit of the specific name being applied to the 
Common Eeed-Warbler. Jcroccphalus lacustris (Naum.) is the name by which 
it ought to be known if the rules are to be enforced. Acrocephalus junco (Pall.) 
may be rejected on the ground of want of clear definition also, inasmuch as 
Pallas did not remove it from the genus Turdus.

The general colour of the upper parts is olive-brown with a slight 
shade of rufous, scarcely perceptible on the head, quills, and tail-
feathers, arid most pronounced on the rump and the margins of the 
outside webs of the quills and tail-feathers; the eye-stripe is very 
obscure, huffish white, and does not extend as far as the nape. 
When fresh moulted the quills and tail-feathers have narrow pale 
edges at and near the tips; but these are soon lost by abrasion. 
The wing-coverts and the innermost secondaries gradually become 
paler towards the edge on their outside webs; the breast, flanks, 
and under tail-coverts are pale rufous-brown, shading into nearly 
white on the chin, throat, and centre of belly ; the axillaries, 
thighs, and under wing-coverts and the inner margin of the quills are 
pale huffish brown. The bill is typically Acrocephaline; the upper 
mandible dark, the under mandible pale. The legs, feet, and claws 
are pale horn-colour. Length of wing 3*85 to 3-6 inches, tail 3*5 to 
3*0, culm en 0*9 to 0*8. Second primary equal, or nearly so, to the 
third, which is the longest. 

4. ACKOCxrnALus. 
After the autumn moult the general colour of the unclerparts is 
much more fulvous. In this stage of plumage it is the A.faluohttt rails 
of Sharpe. 

The specific characters of this bird are its large size, pointed 
wing, and pale legs.

This is the Eastern 
form of A. turdoides, differing from that 

species in its smaller 
size, slightly more rounded wing, and darker 

legs. Birds of the year have indistinct dark streaks on the throat, 

and pale tips to the tail-feathers. 

The Chinese Gieat Reed-Warbler breeds in the valley of the 

Amoor, in North China, and Japan. It passes through South China 

on migration, and winters in the islands of the Malay archipelago 

and the Burma peninsula, having been found as far west as Pegu 

and the S. Andaman 
Islands, and as far south as Lombock.

This species dooa not differ in any respect from the preceding in 
colour, and is subject to the same change alter the autumn moult. 
The bill is proportionally somewhat laiger ; the legs, feet, and claws 
are slaty brown. Length of wing 3-5 to 3*0 inches, tail 3*4 to 3*0, 
oilmen 1*05 to 0*88. Third and fourth primaries ncaily equal and 
longest; second primary about equal to the sixth, sometimes a trifle 
longer, sometimes a trifle shorter. 

This species might almost be considered a subspecies of A. oriaitalis; 
but from its restricted range of migiation it has apparently 
become differentiated, and may always be recognized by its larger 
bill, longer tail, and more rounded wing. 

The Indian Great Reed-Warbler appears to have a very limited 
range of migration. It appears to be resident in Egypt, to breed in 
Turkestan and the highlands of Persia, and winter in the lowlands 
of the latter country. It also breeds in Cashmere, Nepal, and probably 
other localities in the Himalayas, wintering in the valley of 
the Ganges. There appears aLso to be a colony resident in Ceylon.

it differs in being of smaller size (especially in the culmen); 
and from the last-mentioned species it also differs in having a proportionally 
shorter tail. 

The East-Australian Heed-Warbler appears to breed in Southeastern 
Australia, where it is a migratory bird, arriving in September 
and retiring north in March during the cold season.

This appears to bo nearly allied to A, stentoreus, differing from 
that species only in being* of slightly smaller size, and in having 
a proportionally shorter tail. It would scarcely be deserving of 
specific rank had it not become isolated in its geographical distribution. 
It is of exactly the same colour as the three preceding 
species, and is apparently subject to the same seasonal changes. The 
legs, feet, and claws are dark brown. Length of wing 3*0 to 2-9 
inches, tail 2*75 to 2'55, culmen 1*0 to 0*05, tarsus 1*05. Third and 
fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary intermediate 
in length between the sixth and seventh. 

So far as is known, Kittlitz's Great Becd-Warbler is confined to 
Ponape or Pinnipet, one of the more easterly of the Caroline Islands, 
where it is said to be a resident species.

The general colour of the upper parts varies from olive-brown in 
spring' plumage to earthy brown in summer plumage, with a scarcely 
perceptible shade of rufous after the autumn moult, slightly paler on 
the lump; eye-stripe nearly obsolete; innermost secondaries with 
broad ill-defined pale edges; wing-coverts, quills, and tail-feathers 
a slightly darker brown, with narrow edges to the outside webs of 
the same colour as the back; quills and tail-feathers, when frcshmoultod, 
with narrow pale edges at and near the tips, but these are 
soon lost by abrasion. The breast, Hanks, and under tail-coverts 
are pale buff, shading into neaily white on the chin, throat, and 
centre of belly ; the axillaries, thighs, and under wing-coverts, and 
tho inner lining of the quills are pale buff. After the autumn moult 
the whole of the underparts are suffused with buff. The bill is 
Acrocephaline, the upper mandible dark and the under mandible 
pale; the rictal bristles are very slightly developed. The legs, feet, 
and claws are pale horn-colour. Length of wing 2-8 to 2*45 inches, 
tail 2*4 to 2*0, culm en 0*7 to 0-57. Second primary very slightly 
shorter than the third, in rare instances shoiter than the fourth. 

The Marsh Reed-Warbler breeds in Central and Southern Europe, 
extending its range eastwards as far as Persia, and possibly as far 
as Turkestan. It winters in Central Africa.

* It being impossible to determine to what bird Linnaeus intended to apply 
his name of Mofatilta saliearia, which has been identified with many other 
species, and the Ttirdus arundbiaceus of Linnaeus having been removed to the 
genus Acrocephalus, and the name extensively applied to the Great Sedge-
Warbler, we must unfortunately ignore the latter familiar name in favour of 
that of Vieillot, which appears to be the earliest untainted name.

This species exactly resembles the preceding, except that the 
plumage of both the upper and under parts is distinctly suffused 

•with rufous, which is especially pronounced on the rump and upper 
tail-coverts, and considerably so on the breast, flanks, and under 
tail-coverts. The legs, feet, and claws are slaty brown. Length 
of wing 2-7 to 2-35 inches, tail 2-3 to 1*95, oilmen 0-7 to 0*0. 
The second primary is generally equal to the fourth, occasionally a

The general colour of the upper parts varies from olive-brown in 

4 . ACEOCEPHALUS. 
spring plumage to a faded olive-brown in summer, with a decidedly 
fulvous tinge after the autumn moult; eye-stripe nearly obsolete; 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries very slightly browner, except 
towards the edge of the feathers; quills and tail-feathers a 
slightly darker brown, with narrow edges to the outside webs of 
the same colour as the back; quills and tail-feathers when fresh-
moulted with narrow pale edges at and near the tips, but these are' 
soon lost by abrasion; the breast, flanks, and thighs are brownish 
buff, shading into pale bunish white on the chin, throat, and centre 
of belly, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and the inner margin of the 
quills. After the autumn moult the whole of the underparts are 
suffused with a pure delicate buff. The bill is Acrocephaline, the 
upper mandible dark and the under mandible pale; the rictal 
bristles are very slightly developed. The legs, feet, and claws are 
pale horn-colour. Length of wing 2-5 to 2*33 inches, tail 2-3 to 
2*0, culmen 0*7 to 0*6. Third and fourth primaries nearly equal 
and longest; second primary always shorter than the fifth, 
usually between the sixth and seventh, but occasionally shorter than 
the seventh. 

Blyth's Reed~"Warbler breeds in the Central Palsearctic Begion, 
from St. Petersburg eastwards at least as far as the valley of the 
Yenesay. It also breeds in the Himalayas from Cashmere to Nepal, 
wintering in India as far south as Ceylon. It does not appear to 
have been observed in the Burma peninsula.

The general colour of the upper parts varies from russet-brown 
in spring to almost an earthy brown in summer, becoming still 
more rufous after the autumn moult; eye-stripe very narrow, and 
becoming very obscure behind the eye; wing-coverts, innermost 
secondaries, quills, and tail-feathers browner, edged on the outside 
webs with the same colour as the back; quills and tail-feathers 
when fresh-moulted with narrow pale edges at and near the tips, 
which are soon lost by abrasion. In spring the underparts are 
pale buff, darkest on the breast, flanks, and thighs; on the three 
latter parts some buff is always retained, but the rest of the underparts 
fade in summer to nearly pure white ; after the autumn 
moult the buff of the underpays is richer and purer in colour 
than in spring. Bill almost as slender as in Phylloscnpus; upper 
mandible dark, under mandible pale, darker towards the tip; 
rictal bristles moderately developed. Legs, feet, and claws pale 


horn-colour. Length of wing 2-35 to 2*0 inches, tail about the 
same, eulraen 0*56 to 0*52. Fourth primary longest; second primary 
equal to the seventh, sometimes a trifle shorter, sometimes 
a trifle longer; bastard primary slightly longer than in typical 
Acrocephahts, in adult birds as long as the primary-coverts, in 
birds of the year projecting 0*15 inch beyond them. 

The most characteristic features of this species are its small bill 
and long tail. 

Jerdon's Reed-Warbler breeds in the valley of the Lower Volga, 
extending its range eastwards in the Palaearctic Eegion at least as 
far as Turkestan, and probably as far as China. It also breeds in 
the Himalayas from Cashmere to Nepal, and winters in the plains 
of India.

The general colour of tho upper parts varies from a rich russotbrown, 
darkest on the head and palest on the rump ; in spring and 
autumn plumage to a faded earthy brown, with little or no russet 
lo4t except on the rump in summer and winter; eye-stripe neatly 
obsolete ; quills and tail-feathers a darker brown than in the preceding 
species, but the variations in the detail of their coloration, 
as well as those of the underparts, the same ; tho bill the same as 
in tho last species, but the legs, fevt, and claws darker, pale ashcolour. 
Length of wing 2-48 to 2*18 inches, tail 2*2 to 2*0, culmen 
0*67 to 0*6. Third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; 
second primary equal to the seventh, sometimes a triHe shorter, 
sometimes a trifle longer. 

This species is an African form of the preceding, and differs from 
it only in having the upper parts of a more decided coffee-brown, 
and in being slightly smaller in size. 

The South-African lleed-"\Yarbler appears to be confined to 
Central and South Africa, breeding in the Tiansvaal and Daraara 
Land, and probably remaining there during tho whole year. Hartlanb's 
bird from Lado, Central Africa, appears to bo a partial albino 
of the species.

The genus Locustella comprises the Grasshopper "Warblers, a small 
but woll-definoci group of birds nearly allied to Aerocephalus, 
agreeing with this genus in having 12 tail-feathers, the tarsus 
scntellatecl in front, and the bastard primary so minute as rarely 
to extend beyond the primary-coverts. It differs from Acrocephalus 
in having a more rounded tail, and nearly obsolete rictal bristles. 
The outside tail-feathers are shorter than the under tail-coverts, 
except in one instance, where, however, they are less than three 
fourths the length of the longest. The bill is long and slender, 
as in the Calamocline group of Acrocephalus, which many of the 
species further resemble in having the upper parts spotted. The 
predominant colours are russet-brown and olive-brown. 

These birds are all migratory and moult twice in the year. So 
far as is known, all the species have the continuous monotonous 
note, which can scarcely be called a song, and which has given them 
the name of Grasshopper Warblers. 

Three of the species breed in Central Europe, and winter in 
North Africa; a fourth breeds in Wrestern Siberia, and winters in 
India; a fifth breeds in Eastern Siberia, and winters in India, 
Burmah, and the Malay archipelago ; a sixth also breeds in Eastern 
Siberia, and a seventh on the eastern shores of the Pacific—both 
these latter wintering in the islands of the Malay archipelago.

In a J) wad m my collect ion from Ainoy, and in another from 
Ifakodadi, the pah* ash~^rey on the chin, throat, and breast is replaced 
on the chin and upper throat by pale brownish white, shading 
into brown on the lower throat, v\hich becomes more oehraceous on 
the breast. It is possible, however, that the fully adult female may 
be found to bo similar to the male. Afftr the autumn moult the 
ash-grey of the breast is less violet in colour. In birds of the i/tar 
the whole of the plumage is suifused with yellow, causing the 
general colour of the upper parts to bo more olive-brown than 
russet -brown, and the chin, throat, and centre of belly to bo huffish 
yellow. In this plumage, which of course continues until the 
spring moult, becoming duller by the usual abrasion which takes 
place during the winter, it is the J . fuse hiatus of Gray and the

slightly more dusky on the wings, and very slightly paler on the 
margins of the innermost secondaries, and more so on the outside 
web of the second primary ; a scarcely perceptible eye-stripe ; lores

generally obscure traces of transverse bars on the tail. The underpays 
aie greyish brown, shading somewhat abruptly into whire on 
the throat, centre of belly, under -wing-coverts, and the tips of the 
under tail-coverts; the leathers on the throat and fore neck have 
dark centres ; auxiliaries and thighs pale brown ; inner lining of 
quills palo grey. Bill typically Locustclline; upper mandible dark 
brown, under mandible pale horn-colour ; rictal bristles scarcely 
perceptible. "Wings very slightly concaved; second and third 
primaries neaily equal and longest; bastard primary very small, 
considerably shorter than the primary-coverts. Tail shorter than

shorter than the under tail-coverts. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 2*96 to 2*7 inches, tail 2*5 to 2-3, culmen 
0-6 to 0-54, tarsus 0-8. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the colour of the 
plumage between the sexes, or that any change takes place during 
the autumn moult. Birth of the year are said to have the throat 
plain, without the dark centres; but I have been unable to obtain 
access to a skin in this plumage. 

The Eiver Grasshopper Warbler breeds in Russia as far north as 
Lake Ladoga, probably not extending its range westwards beyond 
the valley of the Danube. It is also supposed to breed in Asia 
ILinor and Palestine, probably wintering in North Africa.

It is not known that the sexes differ in plumage, or that the 
autumn moult produces any change of colour. Birds of the year 
are said to be less rufous on the upper parts, and paler underneath. 

Savi's Grasshopper Warbler appears to be sparingly distributed 
throughout Central and Southern Europe, including tho British 
Islands^ Eastwards it has been found as far as Palestine. It also 
breeds in some parts of the southern shores of the Mediterranean. 
It is said to be a resident in some parts of Franco, but probably the 
greater number migrate to North Africa for the winter.

There is no difference in the plumage of the sexes, nor is it known 
that there is, any difference between spring and autumn plumage. 
In birds of the year the whole plumage is more or less suffused with 
yellow, causing the geneial colour of the upper paits to he a dark 
olive-brown, and the chin and centie of belly to be huffish yellow. 
In this plumage it is the Annul inax blalirfoni of Swinhoe. 

Middendorff's Grasshopper Warbler breeds in North-eastern 
Siberia and the Kurile Islands, passes through Japan on migration, 
and winters in the islands of the Malay archipelago.

General colour of the upper parts russet-brown, greyer on the 
head, more tawny on the rump and upper tail-coverts, and much 
paler on the edges of the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries. 
In youngish adults each feather, except the quills, has a dark 
centre; in the tail-feathers the dark centre forms a large spot near 
the end, becoming narrower towards the rump, and is, in fact, a 
semiconfluent series of bars, becoming broader and less obscure 
towards the tip of the feather, where they are emphasized on all

hut the two centre feathers by a nearly white apex. In older birds 

these dark subterminal spots on the 1 eel rices become loss conspi


cuous, and the dark centres to the leal hers of the rump and upper 

tail-coverts disappear altogether. Inside web of the second primary 

paler; eye-stripe narrow and obscure ; lores and the feathers behind 

the eye hro^ n. The underpartn are nearly while on the chin, throat, 

centre of belly, axillaries, and under ^ing-eoverts, shading into 

bullish brown on the thinks and thighs, and into pale bullish brown 

on the breast and under tail-coverts, the latter having obscure 

white tips. Tail-feathers becoming daiker towards the ape.\ on the 

under surface, and finally tipped vutli greyish white. lull typically 

locuslelline ; upper mandible dark brow n, under mandible pale horn


colour, darker towards the tip; rictal bristles obsolete. Wing 

with; he third primary the longest, and the second intermediate in 

length between the fourth and fifth, m very rare cases between the 

third and fouith; bastard primary generally shorter than the pri


mary-coverts, but in birds of the year sometimes extending 0*1 inch 

beyond them. Tail with the outside feather (H>5 inch blunter than 

the longest, and 
shorter than the under tail-coverts. Legs, feet, 

and claws pale brown. Length of wing 2*8 to 2*4 inches, tail 2*3 

to 2*0, culmen 0-01 to 0-38, tarsus IK). 

There is no difference in the plumage of the sexes. After the 

autumn moult the bullish brown of the underparts is deeper in tint, 

approaching chestnut-brown. Birds of the ijatr have the under


parts suffused with yellow, and many of the feathers of the throat 

have dark centres. The striation of the throat is seldom entirely 

lost after the first spring moult, and traces of striation are often 

met with on the flanks and the longest feathers of the under tail


covcits in apparently adult birds. 

Pallas's Grasshopper AVarbler breeds in Central and Eastern

General colour of the upper parts olive-brown, each feather having 
an obscure dark centre, which becomes nearly obsolete on the sides 
of the neck and on the longest upper tail-covorts; lores and the 
feathers behind the eye olive-brown; eye-stripe very narrow and 
indistinct, and soon losing itself behind the eye ; quills and tail-
feathers brown, the outside webs edged with olive-brown, most conspicuously 
so on the innermost secondaries; generally obscure traces

of transverse bars on the tail. Chin and centre of belly while, 
shading into buffish brown on the breast, flanks, thighs, and under 
tail-coverts, most of the latter have narrow dark-brown centres; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts pale buffish brown ; inner margin 
of quills palish brown. "Wing with the third primary longest, and 
the second slightly longer or slightly shorter than the fourth; 
bastard primary very small, rarely, if ever, extending beyond the 
primary-coverts. Bill typically Locustelline, indistinguishable from 
Phylloscopine, upper mandible dark, under mandible pale; rictal 
bristles obsolete. Tail generally shorter, but sometimes nearly as 
long as the wing; outside feathers 0-5 inch shorter than the longest, 
and shorter than the under tail-coverts. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 2'Q to 2*27 inches, tail 2*4 to 1*95, culmen 
0*58 to 0-51, tarsus 0-8. 

The plumage of the sexes is alike. After the autumn moult the 
brown on the breast and flanks is darker, buffer, and more extended. 
In birds of the year the whole of the underparts are more or less 
suffused with yellow, and most of the feathers on the throat have 
dark centres. A slight tinge of yellow on the underparts, and some 
of the pectoral streaks, are frequently found in young birds after 
their first spring moult. 

The Grasshopper Warbler is a summer migrant to Central and 
Southern Europe, not extending further north than the British 
Islands. It probably winters in North Africa, though it is said to 
be occasionally found in South Europe throughout the year.

primary in two skins between the third and fourth, in one equal to 
the fourth, in three between the fourth and fifth, in two equal to the 
fifth, and in two between the fifth and sixth ; bastard primary very 
small, but occasionally extending slightly beyond the primary-
coverts. Tail slightly shorter than the wing, the outside feathers 0*6 
to 0-8 inch shorter than the longest, and shorter than the under tail-
coverts. Legs, feet, and claws pale horn-colour. Length of wing 
2-4 to 2-05 inches, tail 2*25 to 1*85, culmen 056 to 0*4h, tarsus 0*75. 

It is not known that the sexes differ in plumage. After the 
autumn moult the spots on the back are somewhat less clearly defined. 
Birds of the year appear to be unknown. 

The Siberian Grasshopper Warbler is supposed to breed in Southwestern 
Siberia from the Ural Mountains to Turkebtan, and to winter 
in the plains of India.

Locust elline; upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale 
horn-colour ; rietal bristles obsolete. Wings with the third primary 
longest; second primary generally intermediate in length between 
the third and fourth, in rare instances between the fourth and fifth ; 
bastard primary very small, extending about as far as the primaiycoverts. 
Tail shorter than the wing, the outside feathers ()•(> to 0-7 
inch shorter than the longest, and shorter than the under tail-coverts. 
Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 2-25 to 2-0 inches, 
tail 2*0 to 1-G5, culmeu 0-5 to 044, tixsiis 0*7s\o 0-7. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the plumage of the 
sexes. After the nut twin mo alt no important change of colour is 
observable. Birds of the year have the whole of the underparts 
suifiised witli greyish yellow. 

The dark-brown streaks in the centre of the feathers in the underparts 
vary as follows :— 

L. maeropiLs (Swinh.)-—The type, in my collection, from Amoy, in 
China (^lay 31), has no streaks whatever on the underparts, except 
a few very obscure ones on the Hanks, and the slightest possible 
traces on the throat. 
L. minuta (Swinh.).—The type, in my collection, from Amoy and 
a second skin from Canton agree in having tlio sides of the throat, 
the breast, and Hanks conspicuously streaked. In the Amoy skin, 
which appears to be adult, a few of the basal under tail-coverts are 
also very obscurely streaked ; but in the Canton skin, which, from 
the tint of yellow which pervades the underparts, 1 take to be a 
bird of the year, the whole of the under tail-coverts are conspicuously 
streaked. 
L. htnceolata (Temra.).—A skin, in my collection, from Lake Baical, 
which the yellowness of the underparts induces me to believe is that 
of a bird of the year, has the throat and breast distinctly streaked, 
and a few obscure streaks on the flanks and the basal under tail-
coverts. A skin from Lake Baical and another from Cheefoo have 
the whole of the underparts conspicuously streaked, except the chin, 
the centre of the belly, and the longer under tail-coverts, and agree 
with Meves's description of skins from Lake Ladoga. Two skins from 
Lake Baical and one from Cheefoo have the whole of the under tail-
coverts as conspicuously streaked as the throat, breast, and iiauks, 
and agree with descriptions of skins from Europe and Hume's descriptions 
of skins from the South-Andaman Islands. 
The variation in size appears to be about the same in all these 
forms. 

At present, with the scanty material at command, it seems impossible 
to determine which, if any, of these forms should be considered 
specific. I think that L* sfmmima is unquestionably de

It is not known that there is any difference in the plumage of the 
sexes. After the autumn moult no important change of colour is 
observable. Birds of the year have the whole of the underpays 
suffused with greyish yellow. 

The dark-brown streaks in tho centre of the feathers in tho tinder-
parts vary as follows :— 

L. macropiis (Hwinh.).—The type, in my collection, from Arnoy, in 
China play 31), has no streaks whatever on the underparts, except 
a few very obscure ones on the flanks, and the slightest possible 
traces on the throat. 
L. minuta (Swinh.).—The typo, in my collection, from Arnoy and 
a second skin from Canton agree in having the sides of the throat, 
the breast, and flanks conspicuously streaked. In the Arnoy skin, 
which appears to bo adult, a few of the basal under tail-coverts are 
also very obscurely streaked ; but in the Canton skin, which, from 
tho tint of yellow which pervades the undorparls, 1 take to be a 
bird of the 5 ear, the whole of the under tail-coverts are conspicuously 
streaked. 
L. la neeol'Ua (Temm.).—Asian, in my collection, from Lake Tsaical, 
which the yellowness of the underparts induces mo to believe is that 
of a bird of the year, has the throat and breast distinctly streaked, 
and a few obscure streaks on the flanks and the basal under tail-
coverts. A skin from Lake JBaical and another from Cheefoo have 
the whole of the underparts conspicuously streaked, except the chin, 
the centre of the belly, and the longer under tail-coverts, and agree

General colour of the upper parts olive-brown, slightly paler on 
the rump and upper tail-coverts ; lores pale huffish brown; no eyestripc; 
wings and tail brown ; all the wing-coverts and quills 
narrowly edged with pale olive-brown on the outside webs. Underparts 
pale bullish white, shading into pale burl on the breast, flanks,

buff; inner margin of quills pale huffish brown. Bill shoit and 
thick, but wide at base ; upper mandible dark brown, under mandible 
pale horn-colour; rictal bristles well developed. Wing rather 
short and blunt; third and fourth primaries nearly equal and

The female does not appear to differ from the male. After the 
autumn moult both the upper and under parts are suffused with 
russet-brown, which is still more pronounced in birds of the year. 

Pallas's Grass-Warbler breeds in South-eastern Siberia and North. 
China, wintering in India, Burma, and the Andaman Islands. It is 
also found in Nepal, and may possibly breed there at high elevations.

that this bird is the " Caqueteuse" of Levaillant, but it is difficult to reconcile the

that Dr. Hartlaub was the first author who " clearly defined" this species.

General colour of the upper parts brown, gradually shading into 
russet-brown on tlie rump and upper tail~co\orts; lores and ear-
coverts brown; eye-stripe ill-dciined, greyish white, losing itself 
over the eye ; wings and tail brown, all the wing-coverts and 
quills narrowly edged with russet-brown on the outride webs ; tail-
feathers edged with rus^et-brown, and paler at the tip, especially 
on the outside feathers. Underparts nearly white, shading into 
grey on the sides of the breast, and into pale bullish, brown on the 
flanks; thighs brown; axillarics nearly white; under wing.
coverts pale buff; inner margin of quills pale bullish brown. Bill 
long and slender, not very wide at the base ; upper mandible dark 
brown, under mandible pale horn-colour, darker towards the tip; 
rictal bristles small. Wing wide, short, and blunt; fourth and 
fifth primaries nearly equal and longest; second .primary equal to 
the ninth or tenth ; bastard primary 0*8 to 1-0 inch. Tail shorter 
than the wing, the outside feathers from 0*4 to 0*7 inch shorter than 
the longest. Legs, feet, and claws dark slate-colour. Length of wing 
3*15 to 2-0 inches, tail 2*9 to 2-45, culmoii 0-8 to 0-7, tarsus 1*1. 
The plumage described is that of April and Hay, which I take to 
be that of autumn and winter. Theie appears to be no difference 
between the male uml female, but birds of tlw i/atr are more rufous 
both above and below. The spring and summer plumage appears 
to be unknown. 
The South-African (Trass-Warbler is found in South Africa from 
the Congo, Danxara Land, and the Transvaal down to the Cape, it 
is probably a resident; but of this writers on African ornithology, 
with their accustomed carelessness, fail to inform us.

General colour of the upper parts neutral brown; lores pale; 
eye-stripe indistinct greyish white, losing itself behind the eye ; 


•wings and tail a nearly uniform brown; chin and upper throat 
white, the lower throat and the sides of the whole throat with 
dark-brown cuneiform spots; the rest of the tmderparts obscurely 
mottled white and pale brown, the white predominating on the 
centre of the belly and under tail-coverts ; axillaries nearly white ; 
under wing-coverts pale brown, mottled with dark brown on the 
shoulder; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill long and slender, 
both mandibles dark brown, approaching black; no rictal bristles. 
"Wing narrow, short, and blunt; third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest; second primary about equal to the 
eighth; bastard primary 0-5 to 0*7 inch. Tail longer than the wing, 
the outside feathers 0*8 to 1*0 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, 
feet, and claws pale horn-colour. Length of wing 2*45 to 2-26 
inches, tail 2*65 to 2-46, culmen 0-7 to 0*62, tarsus 0-9. 
The female only differs from the male in having fewer spots on 
the throat. Birds of the year have more buff on the breast, and the 
spots on the throat are very few and very obscure. It is not known 
what changes of plumage take place in the adult birds after the 
autumn moult. 

Brooks's Grass-War bier breods in Cashmere, probably migrating 
towards the plains at the approach of the cold season.

6. TIUHOINIOTA. 
General colour of the upper parts dark russet-brown wiih a blight 
tinge of olivo ; lores and the feathers behind the eye dark brown ; 
eyo-stripe pale ashy white, indistinct, and soon losing itself behind 
the eye; wings and tail scarcely duller in colour than the back; 
chin and centre of belly nearly white, shading into ashy grey on the 
throat and breast and into olive-brown on the Hanks and under tail-
coverts ; the throat is more or less profusely spotted with dark 
brown, and the under tail-coverts are broadly tipped with nearly 
white; axillarics and under wing-coverts nearly white, the latter 
mottled with brown ; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill Phylloscopine, 
dark brown, nearly black, frequently paler at the base of 
the lower mandible; rictal bristles obsolete. Wings considerably 
concaved; third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and 
longest; second primary equal to the ninth or tenth ; fir&t primary 
about half the length of the second. Tail shortor than the wing, 
outside feathers 0*8 to 0*9 inch shorter than the longest. Logs, feet, 
and claws pale horn-colour. Length of wing 2*3 to 2*03 inches, 
tail 2*15 to 1*8, culmen 0*52 to 0-47, tarsus 0*83 to 0*73. 

It is not known that there is any difference of plumage in the 
sexes, though some bircL are much more spotted on the throat than 
others. In what I take to be winter plumage the upper parts are 
much more olive, and may be described as olive-brown with a slight 
shade of russet, and the spots on the throat are somewhat obscure. 
A third variety has the upper parts of the same colour as the supposed 
winter plumage, but has no spots on the throat, and the ash-
grey of the throat and breast is replaced by pale chestnut-brown. 
This I take to be young in first winter plumage, though Biyth has 
described it as a separate species. One of the skins in the collection, 
in the plumage last described, has undoubtedly fourteen tail-
feathers. This is probably only an accidental monstrosity. 

Hodgson's Grass-Warbler is found in the Himalayas, where it is 
probably a partial migrant. It has been found in !N"epal and Sikkim 
and at Simla. It also breeds in South Siberia and ]NTorth-west 
China, where it is undoubtedly only a summer visitor.

General colour of the upper parts russet-brown, inclining to olive; 
lotcs and behind the eye dark brown; eye-stripe pale chestnut, very 
indistinct; wings and tail slightly darker than the back; chin, 
throat, and centre of belly nearly white, shading into pale chestnut 
on the breabt, flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts ; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts buiRsh white, mottled, with brown on the 
shoulder ; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill Phylloscopine, 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale horn-colour; 
rictal bristles obsolete. "Wing short, blunt, and somewhat concaved; 
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and longest; 
second primary equal to the secondaries, bastard piimary half the 
length of the second primary. Tail longer than the wing, outside 
feathers 1 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 2-23 to 1*95 inches, tail 2'G to 2-2, culmen 
0-51 to Oo, tarsus 0-8 to 0-7. 

In some skins the brown of the upper parts is slightly more olive. 
These may be winter plumage of adults or young. 

So far as is known, the Jirown Grass-Warbler is confined to the 
Himalayas, having hilheito only been found in Nepal and Sikkim. 
The skins which I'Abbe David obtained at Moupin appear to me to 
be birds of the year of L. thorcnica (Blyth).

General colour of tho upper pari a oarthy brown, with a scarcely 
perceptible, ochracoous tinge on tho rump; eye-si ripe from the ]>ase 
of the hill to over the eye deep yellow, shading into hut? behind tho 
eye to the nape; lores and the feathers behind the eye oarthy 
brown; quills brown, with very narrow pale tips ; tail-feathers 
brown, narrowly tipped and margined on the inner web with greyish 

•white. General colour of the underparts buffi.sk yellow, greyer on 
the breast and flanks ; axillarics and under wing-coverts buff; inner 
margins of quills greyish buff. Bill Ph\ Iloscopino, upper mandible 
dark brown, under mandible pale horn-colour; rictal bristles moderately 
developed. "Wing rather short and blunt; fourth and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the tenth; bastard primary 0*85 to 0*65 inch, someiimes nunc, sometimes 
less than half tho length of the second. Tail shorter than 
the wing, the outside feathers 0*1 inch shorter than the longest. 
Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 2*05 to 2*2 inches, 
tail 2*2 to 1*75, culm en 0*55 to 0*49, tarsus 0-8 to 0*75. 
The ftmede scarcely differs from the male. After the autumn 
moult the yellow of the underparts is slightly more buff. 
Jerdon's Grass-Warbler probably breeds in the alpine districts of 
the Himalayas, and winters in Central India.

128 TTTRPIDJE. 

General colour of the upper parts brown; a narrow, well-
defined huffish-white eye-stripe extends from the base of the bill as 
far as the nape; the feathers before the eye and behind the eye 
as far as the nape dark brown ; quills brown ; tail-feathers brown, 
the inside webs narrowly edged with pale buff. General colour of 
the underparts huffish white, shading into buff on the breast, flanks, 
and under tail-coverts; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs 
buff; inner margin of quills greyish buff. Bill Phylloscopine, upper 
mandible dark brown, under mandible pale, darkening towards the 
tip; rictal bristles fairly developed. Fourth and fifth primaries 
longest; second primary equal in length to the ninth or tenth; 
bastard primary 0-8 to 0'7 inch, rather more than half the length of 
the second. Tail shorter than the wing ; outside feathers 0*1 inch 
shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of 
wing, male 2-55 to 2-3 inches, female 2*35 to 2*15 ; length of tail, 
male 2-4 to 2-2, female 2-2 to 2-0; length of culmen 0-45 to 0*49 • 
tarsus 0-9 to 0-8. 

The female does not differ from the male. The only effects of 
abrasion appear to be that the buff of the underparts becomes slightly 
greyer. After the autumn moult the brown of the upper parts is 
slightly richer, the eye-stripe is pale buff, and the breast, flanks, 
and under tail-coverts are a rich buff approaching chestnut. 

El} th's Grass-Warbler breeds in South-eastern Siberia and Japan, 
passes through South-eastern Mongolia and North China on migration, 
and winters in Formosa, South China, Assam, Burma, and 
near Calcutta.

General colour of the upper parts clunky olive-brown, Romewhal 
less dusky on the rump ; eye-stripe pale buff from the INISO of the 
bill to the eye, over and behind the eye to the nape pale bullish 
white and very sharply defined; lores and the feathers behind the 
eye brown; quills brown, edged on tho outside web with olive; 
tail-feathers brown, margined on the outbid© webs with olive and on 
the inside webs with pale brown. General colour of the under parts 
yellowish white, fading into nearly pure white on the throat and the 
centre of the belly, buffer on the breast, iianks, and thighs, and 
becoming yellowish buff on the under tail-coverts; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts buff; inner margin of quills pale buff. Bdl much 
stouter than in typical Phylhseopus ; upper mandible dark brown, 
under mandible pale ; rictal bristles fairly developed. Tail shorter 
than the wing; outside feathers 0*2 to 1*5 inch shorter than the 
longest. Pourth and fifth primaries longest; second primary intermediate 
in length between the seventh and eighth; bastard primary 
frequently more than half the length of the second, the exposed 
part measuring 0*75 to 0*9 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale horncolour. 
Length of wing 2*5 to 2-35 inches, tail 2*2 to 2*05, culmen 
0*48 to 0*5, tarsus 0*9 to 0-85. 

The female does not differ from the male. Most of the olive on 
the upper parts disappears in very abraded skins, and the underpays 
become paler. After the autumn moult the upper parts become 
tawny olive where they were dusky olive in spring, and the underparts 
are more or less suffused all over with a tawny buff. The 
eye-stripe is also much buffer. 

lladde's Grass-Warbler breeds in South-eastern Siberia, pasbes 
through North China on migration, and winters in South China 
where it borders on Thibet and in the Burma peninsula.

which is very indistinct, and tho whole of tho underparhs, including 

the axilla HON and under wing-covcrts, are pule olive-brown, yel

The female is supposed to be similar to the male. Nothing is 

known of tho changes of plumage of this species, no sexed or elated 

skins being accessible in this country. We may, however, safely 

assume that they are unimportant, and that the effects of abrasion 

are also slight in a bird which can scarcely bo called a migrant. 

$o far as is known, tho Smoky Grass-Warblor is confined to Nopal 

and Hikkim, breeding at some elevation on the hills, and retiring to 

the valleys during the cold season.

seen the skin in my own collection (Moupin, Ph*e David, July 5, 
1809), and two skins in the Mtiseum of the Jardin do Plantes, collected 
by the same eminent field-naturalist. These skins all agree 
in having tho bill somewhat stouter than that of L.fmeata, and in 
having tho throat and belly greenish white instead of huffish white. 
The feet are more slender than those of L. fuscata, and much more 
so than those of L. schwarzi In all other respects there is no 
apparent difference between the two species. The height of the bill 
at the nostrils of L. fuscata measures 0*09 inch, of L. armandi 0*11, 
and of L. schwarzi 0*15.

Nothing is known of the changes -which may be produced by age, 
season, or sex. 

But little Is known of the geographical distribution of David's 
Grass-Warbler—it having only been recorded from S.E. Mongolia, 
Northern and Western China. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species. 
I have examined the types in the Paris Museum, and have in my 
collection one of the skins obtained by FAbbe David.

The head of the female is slightly paler than that of the male. 
After the autumn moult the undcrparts have less brown on the 
breast and flanks; but in birds of the year this is more developed, 
leaving the chin, throat, and centre of belly alone nearly white. 

The Moustached Grass-Warbler appears to be a resident on both 
shores of the Mediterranean; extending eastwards into Persia. In 
Scinde and the Forth-west Provinces of India it appears to bo only a 
visitor during the cold season, probably breeding in Turkestan, 
though Severtzoff does not record it from there.

The genus Cettia contains a small group of Bush-Warblers, distinguished 
by having only ten tail-feathers. It forms a connecting link 
between the sharp, flat-winged Sylviidaz and the round concave-
winged Sylviidce. In some species the wing is not much concaved, but 
in all it is very rounded. The first primary is always half the length 

134 TVWDWJi, 

of the second, and generally rather more than half; the second 
primary is about equal in length to the secondaries. The tail is 
considerably rounded, tho outside feathers being only from two thirds 
to five sixths the length of the longest. The tarsus and feet are 
very robust; tho former more or less distinctly scutellated in 
front. Tho feathers of the rump are usually much developed. The 
predominant colours are russet-brown and olive-brown, many of tho 
species having the head of a redder and richer colour than the rest 
of the upper parts. 80 far as is known, most of the species lay eggs 
of a uniform brick-red colour. Most of the species have very rich 
and melodious voices, but very poor powers of song. 

The centre of distribution of this genus is the Himalayas, where 
five of tho species breed; of these, two extend their range to Chinese 
Thibet. Eour other species appear to be peculiar to China and 
Japan, and one to Manchooria; whilst the remaining species breeds 
in Turkestan and winters in Scinde, extending its range westwards 
to the Mediterranean, throughout the shores of which inland sea it 
appears to bo a resident.

webs odjredwith rich russet-brown; chin, throat, and centre 
of belly white, shading into ash-grey on the sides of the breast and 
info brownish grey on the flanks and under tail-coverts, the latter 
tipped with white ; axilbxries and under wing-coverts pale brownish 
grey with white margins; inner margin of quills pale brown. 
Bill* Phylloseopine; upper mandible dark brown, under mandible 
pale horn-colour, darker towards the tip; rictal bristles almost 
obsolete. Wing considerably concaved; fourth, fifth, and sixth 
primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary about as long 
as the secondaries ; bastard primary rather more than half the length 

of the second. Tail about equal to the wing, sometimes slightly 
shorter, sometimes slightly longer, the outside feathers OS to 0*4 
inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws very pale brown. 
Length of wing, male 2*6 to 2*15 inches, female 2'25 to 2*15: 
tail 2-0 to 2-15 ; culmen 0*56 to 0-48 ; tarsus 0*92 to 0*70. 

The female is generally smaller and less subject to vary in size 
than the male. After the autumn moult the upper parts are of a 
richer rnssct-brown, almost coffee-coloured, and the white of the 
undcrparts is greyer and more restricted. Birds of the year are 
scarcely to be distinguished from adults. 

Cetti's Bush-Warbler is a resident on both shores of the Mediterranean, 
extending eastwards as far as Turkestan. It is found in 
the south of France, Spain, Algeria, Italy, Greece, Asia Minor, 
Palestine, and Egypt. In Persia it is probably also a resident; but 
in Turkestan it is undoubtedly a migrant, apparently breeding there 
and wintering in Scinde.

General colour of the upper parts russet-brown; lores and the 
feathers behind the eye dark russet-brown; eye-stripe pale brown, 
indistinct, and soon losing itself behind the eye; wings and tail 
brown, the outside webs edged with russet-brown. The underparts 
are pale punish brown, shading into huffish brown on the breast and 
flanks; axillaries and under wing-coverts pale yellow; inner margin 
of quills greyish white. Bill Sylviine rather than Phylloscopine, 
dark brown, paler at the base of the under mandible ; rictal bristles 
fairly developed. Wing short and blunt, the fourth to the seventh 
primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary shorter than 
any of the succeeding ones; bastard primary more than half the 
length of the second, measuring 0*55 to 0-65 inch. Tail generally 
equal in length to the wing, sometimes a trifle shorter, and occasionally 
a trifle longer; outside feathers 0*45 inch shorter than 
the longest. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 
2-28 to 1-88 inches, tail 2-21 to 1-86, culmen 0-56 to 0-48, 
tarsus 0-83. 

There does not appear to be any difference in the colour of the 
plumage between male sold female, nor is it known that any change 
takes place after the spring moult. Birds of the year have the 
upper parts paler and more tawny in colour, and the underparts 
of an almost uniform pale buffish brown, only very slightly 
darker on the breast, and scarcely at all so on the flanks. 

The types of H. robustipes, Swinh., from Formosa, in my collection, 
have the claw of the hind toe very slightly larger than is usual in 
Indian birds; probably only an individual variation. 

So far as is known, Hodgson's Bush-Warbler is confined to the 
Himalayas from Cashmere to Assam, Western China, and the island 
of Eormosa. In all localities it is doubtless a partial migrant, 
breeding at high elevations above the level of winter snow and 
descending lower into the valleys during the cold season.

General colour of the upper parts dark brownish, green, slightly 
palor on the rump ; lores and the feathers behind the eye brown ; 
eye-stripe huffish yellow, rather indistinct, but extending behind the 
eye; wings and tail brown, the outside webs margined with 
brownish green; chin, throat, and centre of belly deep yellow, 
shading into brownish yellow on the breast, flanks, thighs, and 
under tail-coverts ; axillaries and under wing-coverts bright yellow; 
inner margin of quills nearly white. Bill Phylloscopine, dark brown, 
under mandible pale at the base; rictal bristles well developed. 
Wing concaved; fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and 
longest; second primary slightly shorter than the secondaries; first 
primary more than half the length of the second. Tail about equal 
to the wing, sometimes slightly longer, sometimes slightly shorter, 
the outside feathers 0*5 to 0*45 shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, 
and claws pale brown. Length of wing 2*15 to 1/9 inches, tail 2-2 
to 1-9, culmen 0-51 to 0-48, tarsus 0-9. 

Males (N. flavolivacea, Hodgs.) are supposed to be slightly larger 
than females (N. cacliarensis, Hodgs.). In some skins (Hodgs. MS. 
Drawings, Appondix, pi. 50. no. 976) the upper parts are slightly 
darker and browner. I take this to be the plumage after the autumn 
moult, and possibly also of birds of the year.

Cettia cantans and Cettia minuta. 

These forms apparently interbreed, and produce intermediate forms, 
in spite of their insular distribution. The long-tailed olive form is 
the only one found in Japan. I possess, however, an example from 
Formosa. Birds from the latter island are generally slightly smaller, 
decidedly browner, and shorter in the tail. I have, however, a 
typical example of this intermediate form from Chefoo, opposite 
Japan, on the mainland, whilst I have other examples from Formosa 
approaching still nearer to typical minuta. The latter form is found 
at Amoy, on the mainland, down to Hainan, and is the smallest, 
agreeing with the typical Formosan form in the length of the tail, 
but being still browner in colour, shading into rich russet-brown on 
the forehead. Fo better examples of incipient species could perhaps 
be found. 

The synonymy of the Japanese form is as follows :—

General colour of the upper parts olive-brown, suffused with russet-
brown on the rump and upper tail-coverts; lores and the feathers 
behind the eye brown; eye-stripe greyish white, indistinct, but 
passing over the eyo almost to the nape; wings and tail brown, 
the outside webs edged with russet-brown. Underparts nearly 
white, slightly suffused with pale huffish brown on the breast, flanks,

coverts white ; inner margin of quills greyish white. Bill Sylviine ; 
upper mandible dark brown, under mandible pale horn-colour, darker 
towards the tip; rictal bristles moderately developed. Wing moderately 
rounded; fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and 
longest; second primary about equal to the tenth; bastard primarv 
rather more than half the length of the second primary. Tail equal 

to or longer than the wing, the outside feathers 0'25 to 0*35 inch

The female differs from the male only in being smaller in size. 
After the autumn moult the olive-brown of the upper parts has a 
slight shade of rufous upon it, and the pale huffish brown of the 
breast, flanks, and under tail-ooverts is darker and more olive in 
tone. The plumage of birds of the year is apparently unknown. 

The Japanese Bush-Warbler appears to be confined to Japan and

General colour of the upper parts russet-brown, inclining to olive 
on the back, slightly paler on the rump and upper tail-coverts, and 
shading into rich russct-brown on the forehead; lores and behind 
the eye dark brown; eye-stripe pale huffish white, indistinct, and 
not extending far behind the eye ; wings and tail brown, the outside 
webs of the feathers edged with russet-brown. Chin, throat, 
and centre of belly nearly white, shading into pale huffish brown on 
the breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts; thighs brown ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts silky white; inner margin of quills pale

mandible pale horn-colour, darker towards the tip ; rictal bristles 
moderately developed. Wing slightly concaved, with the fourth and 
fifth primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary about equal 
in length to the secondaries; bastard primary slightly more than 
half the length ol the second. Tail shorter than the wing, the outside 
feathers 0*35 to 0*45 inch shorter than the longest. Legs,

tail 2-35 to 2*0, culmen 0-65 to 0-56, tarsus 1-0 to 0-9. 

The female appears to have rather less of the rich russet-brown 

on the forehead. After the autumn moult the slight; shade of olive 

on the back disappears, and the russet-brown on the forehead is 

much richer in colour, and extend more onto the crown. The 

huffish brown of the breast, flanks, and under tail-coverts also 

becomes darker. The plumage of birds of the year appears to be 

unknown.

feathers behind the eye dark brown; eye-stripe huffish white, well 
defined and extending to the nape; wings and tail dark russet-

In some skins the rich coffee-colour of the head is not quite 
so dark as in others- these I take to be females. It is not 
known that there is any difference between summer and winter 
plumage. In what are supposed to be birds of the year (H.pollkaris^ 
Hodgs.) the rich coffee-colour of the head is entirely absent, the 
upper parts being of a uniform dark russet-brown, and the white 
and ash-grey of the underparts are replaced by light and dark 
brownish yellow.

than the wing; outside feathers 0*4 inch shoiter than the longest. 
Legs, fjet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 2*03 to 2*41 
inches, tail 2-24 to 2-0, culmen 0*50 to 0*55, tarsus 1*02. 

The above description is that of whiter plumage. It is not known 
if the summer plumage varies, or if there is any difference between 
the sexes or birds of the year. 

Moore's Bush-Warbler is probably a partial migrant, breeding at 
or near the limit of forest-growth on the Himalayas (Nepal, 
Sikkim, &c.) and the mountains of Chinese Thibet (Moupin), descending 
into the valleys in the cold season.

Wing of Geocichla varia. 

The genus Geocichla comprises a well-defined group of forty 
Thrushes, which may be distinguished as Ground-Thrushes. They 
are characterized by having the basal portion of the outside 
web of all the secondaries and of many of the primaries white, 
occasionally tinted with buff, but abruptly defined from the brown 
of the rest of the quills. The axillaries are parti-coloured, the basal 
half being white, and the terminal half black, slate-grey, or brown. 
Most of the under wing-coverts are similarly parti-coloured, but the 
relative position of the colours is reversed, the white portion being 
on the terminal half. This genus is connected with the genus 
Turdus through T. viscivorus and T. mustelinus. In the former 
the base of the inner webs of most of the quills is white, but 
gradually shading into, and not abruptly defined from, the brown of 
the rest of the quills; the axillaries and under wing-coverts are 
pure white. In the latter the axillaries have brown centres, and 
the under wing-coverts brown bases. These two genera are also 
connected by the aberrant species of the genus Geocichla. Of these 
the most aberrant are 67. simensis and 67. litsitsirupa, which have 
the axillaries and under wing-coverts uniform in colour; but the 
pale portions of the inner webs of the quills are greatly developed 
and very abruptly defined. 67. pinicola is also slightly aberrant in 
having the axillaries a uniform white. 

So far as I have been able to ascertain, the young in first plumage 
of every species in this genus are spotted on the back and breast; 
and I am not aware that the adult of any species has a scutellated 
tarsus, though traces of it are to be found in young 67. litsitsirwpa-, 
Nor does any species seem to have a spring moult beyond the replacement 
of a few injured feathers.

TURBID Ji1. 

All 
iho Thrushes are principally ground-feeders, especially in 

summer; but the species of this genus are par eve 11 m-e Ground-

Thrushes, being still less frequently found in trees than their near 

allies. Their legs and feet are strong, and pale in colour. 

The bill is moderately stout, about the length of the head, somewhat 
widened at the base, and more or less furnished with rictal 
bristles. In two species it is abnormally short; and in four species 
it is abnormally long and depressed at the ba^e. The bastard 
primary rarely exceeds an inch in length, and is frequently shorter 
than the primary-coverts. The wTing is more or less rounded, as the 
species are more or less sedentary in their habits. 

The tail is nearly even, and consists of twelve feathers, except in 
three species, which have fourteen tail-feathers. In some species the 
sexes are alike, whilst in others they are different. In some species 
the spotted plumage, characteristic of young in first plumage in this 
family, is retained through life, whilst in others it is retained only on 
some of the wing-coverts after the first autumn moult. In others it 
is entirely lost at that time. On the whole this genus must be considered 
one of the best-defined of the family Turd Idee. 

No species of this genus is found in Europe or in South America, 
except accidentally on migration. On the other baud, it is the only 
genus of the family found in Australia, where it is represented by 
three species. New Guinea, Lombock, Timor, and Celebes each add 
a species to the genus. Three more species are found in Java, wThilst 
a fourth is found both in Java and Lombock. Two are peculiar to 
Ceylon. India and Burma add ten species to the genus, whilst 
the islands in the Bay of Bengal add two more. In Eastern Siberia 
this genus is represented by two species; whilst a third has crossed 
the straits and established itself in western Forth America, and a 
fourth has wandered as far as the mountains of Mexico. No less than 
eleven species have been found on the African continent, and probably 
others remain to be discovered.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is ochraceous brown, each feather having a transverse 
terminal crescent-shaped black band; most of the feathers have 
pale shafts and a more or less distinct ochraceous transverse subterminal 
band, veiy conspicuous on the head and neck; lores 
greyish white ; no trace of eye-stripe ; wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries shading from dark olive-brown on the inside webs to 
ochraceous brown on the outside webs, but, with the exception of 
the primary-coverts, wanting the black terminal bands; quills brown, 
the outside webs ochraceous brown; four central and terminal 
portion of two outside tail-feathers on each side ochraceous brown, 
the remaining three on each side very dark olive-brown ; five outside 
tail-feathers on each side more or less distinctly tipped with white, 
and all more or less obscurely barred. Underparts white, with a 
more or less distinct tinge of ochraceous on the breast, each feather 
with a transverse terminal crescent-shaped black band, nearly 
obsolete on the chin, centre of belly, and under tail-coverts; axillaries, 
basal half white, terminal half black; under wing-coverts, 
basal portion black, terminal portion white; basal half of inner web 
of secondaries and basal portion of many of the primaries pale buffi* 
Bill dark brown above, basal half of under mandible pale yellowish 
brown. "Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and 

longest, second primary between the fourth and fifth, bastard 
primary 1*05 to 0-9 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale yellowish brown. 
Length of wing 6-4 to 5-9 inches, tail 4-5 to 4-15, culmen 1-3 to 1-1, 
tarsus 1-4 to 1*3. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the colour of the 
plumage of the sexes, or in consequence of the autumn moult. Birds 
of the year and young in first plumage are unknown.

This species differs from the preceding in having the general 
colour of the upper parts greyish brown instead of ochraceous brown. 
It is also a somewhat larger bird, measuring as under:—Length of 
wing 6-6 inches, tail 4*6, culmen 1*15, tarsus 1*5. The number of 
tail-feathers is fourteen. 

Nothing is known of its changes of plumage. 
The Pormosan Ground-Thrush is supposed to be peculiar to the 
island of .Formosa, where it is probably a resident. 

The British Museuin does not possess an example of this species. 
The type is in the Swinhoe collection in my possession, a second skin 
is in the Twceddale collection in the possession of Capt. Wardlaw 
Eamsay, and a third in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes in 
Paris.

This species differs from the two preceding in being a decidedly 
smaller bird. The general colour of the upper parts is a rich 
russet-brown, and the subterminal bands across the feathers are 
confined to the feathers of the head and neck. It most resembles 


G. Jiehiil (Cab.) in colour, but has the subterminal bands on the head 
more marked, and differs also from that species in having fourteen 
tail-feathers. The second primary is intermediate in length between

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is ochraceous brown, each feather having a transverse 
terminal crescent-shaped black band ; most of the feathers have 
pale shafts and a more or less distinct ochraceous transverse 
subterminal band, very conspicuous on the head and neck; lores 
nearly white; no trace of eye-stripe ; wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries shading from dark olive-brown on the inside webs to 
ochraceous brown on the outside webs, but, with the exception of 
the primary-coverts, wanting the black terminal bands; quills 
brown, the outside webs ochraceous; four central and terminal half 
of the two outside tail-feathers ochraceous brown, the remaining 
three on each side very dark olive-brown; four outside tail-feathers 
on each side more or less distinctly tipped with white, and all more 
or less obscurely barred. Fnderparts white, with a more or less 

distinct tinge of ochraceous on the breast, each feather with a transverse 
terminal crescent-shaped black band, nearly obsolete on the chin, 
centre of belly, and under tail-coverts ; axillaries, basal half white, 
terminal half black ; under wing-coverts, basal portion black, terminal 
portion white ; inner margin of quills very pale buff. Bill dark 
brown above, basal half of under mandible pale brown. "Wing with 
the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; second 
primary generally half an inch longer than the sixth, but a trifle 
shorter than the fifth; bastard primary 1*1 to 0*7 inch. Legs

feci, and claws pale fle^h-colour. Length of wing 5-8 to 5-3 inches, 

tail 4-4 lo 3*6, culmen 1*1 to 1-0, tarnus K52 to P2. 

It is not known that any change in the colour of the plumage is 

attributable to sex or season. Birds of the ymr appear to be 

unknown. Young in first plumage are more ochraceous in colour 

both above and below, and the spots are less distinctly crescentic. 

Examples from the North-west Himalayas are much less ochraceous 
in colour, and might almost be considered subspecifically distinct, 
in which case they would stand as G. parvirostris (Gould). 

The Himalayan Ground-Thrush breeds throughout the Himalaya*, 

descending to the plains in the cold season, where it has been found 

as tar south as Central India and Tenasserini.

This is a fairly well-defined species, and combines the characters 
of G. lunulata and G. papuensis, from either of which it is, however, 
easily distinguishable. Curiously enough, it appears to come 
nearest in coloration to G. nilgiriensis. The general colour of 
the upper parts is russet-brown, both on the head and back, as 
well as on the rump, with the usual black creseentic tips to 
the feathers, and the usual markings on the wings and tail. As 
in the last mentioned species, the subterminal ochraceous spots 
are more developed than in the two first mentioned species, 
especially on the head and nape. Prom G. papuensis and G. heinii 
it may at once be distinguished by the outside tail-feathers, which 
are narrowly, not broadly, tipped with white. From G. nilgiriensis 
it may be best distinguished by the decidedly buff basal portion of 
the inner webs of the secondaries and many of the primaries, which 
in the South-Indian species are white. Bill dark brown, paler at 
the hasp of the under mandible. Wing with the third, fourth, and 
fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal 
to the sixth, bastard primary 1-2 to 1*1 inch. Length of wing 
5-3 to 5*1 inches, tail 4-4 to 4-25, culmen 1-2, tarsus 1*45 .to 1*35. 

Nothing is known of the changes of plumage which this species 
undergoes.

This species, though a perfectly good one, is very nearly allied io the 
preceding, with which it has been generally contused. It differs 
in being a decidedly smaller bird with a longer second primary. 
The markings on the plumage, both of the upper and under parts, 
appear to be piecisely the same, except that the white tip on the 
outside tail-feather of the smaller bird extends for an inch or more 
instead of being about a quarter of an inch in extent. Tfie goneial 
colour of the upper parts as far as the centre of the back is olive-
brown in both species, but in the smaller one it shades into russet-
brown on the rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail. Wing with the third 
and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary between 
the fifth and sixth. Length of wing 4*9 to 4*7 inches, tail 
3*6 to 3*4, culmen 1-1 to 1*0, tarsus 148 to 145. 

Nothing is known of the changes in the colour of the plumage 
attributable to sex, age, or season. 

The North-Australian Ground-Thrush appears to be found 
throughout Eastern Australia as far south as Moreton Bay, probably 
breeding in the mountains and migrating to the plains during 

the cold season.

This species is tolerably well defined, and appears to be intermediate 
between G. dauma and G. Jieinii. The general colour 
of the upper parts is russet-brown, with the usual black crescentic 
tips to the feathers, and the usual markings on the wings and tail. 
The feathers have almost as few traces of the pale subterminal spots 
as those of G. Jieinii and 67. lumdata, except on the head, where

they are, however, chestnut-brown instead of ochraceous, as In 

G. datuna. Lt (litters also from G. Iicinii in having the pale tips 
to the outside tail-feathers very small and obscure. The breast 
is very slightly suffused with buff, and the terminal black bands to 
the feathers are almost semilunar; the basal portion of the inner 
webs of the secondaries and many of the rjrimaries is white, only 
the last primary on which the white occurs showing a buff tint. 
Bill dark brown, paler at the base of the under mandible. Wing 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary 0*9 
inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 5-2 
inches, tail 3*7, culmen L23, tarsus 1*1± 
Nothing is known of the difference between the sexes, or between 
summer and winter plumage. Young in Jinst plumage have the 
chestnut-brown sub terminal spots on most of the feathers of the 
upper parts, the breast is more suffused with buff, and the terminal 
bars on the unclcrparts are more diffused over the whole surface 

^ and still tess crescentic. 
The Neilghorrie Ground-Thrush appears to be confined to the 


t mountain-ranges of South-west India, where it is a resident, probably 
migrating only to the neighbouring valleys duri?ig the cold 
season.

9. GreocicMa papnensis. (Plate IX.) 
General colour of the upper parts russefc-brown, each feather 
becoming slightly more ochraceous towards the tip, where it is terminated 
by a narrow black crescentic band, the feathers of the 
crown and nape having conspicuous subterminal ochraceous spots 
(a character which distinguishes this species from G. Jieinii); the 
wTing~coverts, wings, and tail-feathers have the usual markings of 
the subgeneric group of Oreocinclce, but the inner web of the outside 
tail-feather on each side is white at the tip for an inch and 
a half (a character which distinguishes this species from all its 
known near allies except 67. Jieinii). The underparts are white, 
suffused with buff on the upper throat and breast, each feather 
having a narrow black crescentic terminal band, except on the chin, 
centre of belly, and under tail-coverts. Like all typical species of 
the genus GeoelcJila, the basal half of the inner webs of the 
secondaries and of many of the primaries is pale buff; the 
basal half of the axillaries and the terminal half of the wing-
coverts are white, whilst the terminal half of the axillaries and the 
basal half of the wing-coverts are black. Bill dark brown, pale at 
the base of the under mandible. Wing with third, fourth, and fifth

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dark olive-brown, each feather having a transverse 
terminal crescent-shaped black band; some feathers, especially on 
the head, have an obscure, pale ochraceous, transverse subterminal 
band; wing-coverts and innermost secondaries shading from dark 
olive-brown on the inside webs to ochraceous on the outside webs, 
but, with the exception of the primary-coverts, wanting the black 
terminal bands ; lores pale grey; no trace of eye-stripe; quills brown, 
margined with ochraceous on the outside webs; four central and 
the two outside tail-feathers olive-brown, the remaining three on 
each side very dark olive-brown ; outside tail-feathers tipped with 
white, and all more or less obscurely barred. Undcrparts ochraceous 
buff, each feather with a narrow, transverse, terminal crescent-
shaped black band, nearly obsolete on the chin, centre of belly, and 
under tail-coverts ; axillaries, basal half white, terminal half black ; 
under wing-coverts, basal half black, terminal half white ; basal 
half of the inner web of the secondaries and of many of the primaries 
nearly white. Bill dark brown, paler at the base of the under 
mandible. "Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary between the fifth and sixth, or 
sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1-28 to 1*15 inch. Legs, feet,

Bill of Geocichla monticola. 

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dark brown, each feather obscurely barred with dark 
slate-grey; lores and ear-coverts brown, with pale shafts to the 
feathors; no trace of eye-stripe; wings and wing-coverts darkish 
brown, with obscure paler tips to the median and greater coverts;

tail brown, tlio outside feathers obscurely tipped with white; 
cheeks, sides of the neck, and breast brown, with obscure subterminal 
dark spots on each feather; chin and throat white, with 
dark brown fan-shaped terminal spots on some of the feathers; 
Hanks brown, the feathers obscurely barred with dark brown; 
centre of belly and lowest flanks white, many of the feathers obscurely 
tipped with brown. Under tail-coverts dark brown, with 
white tips; axillaries, basal half white, terminal half dark brown, 
narrow]y edged wiih white; lower under wing-coverts, basal portion 
dark brown, terminal portion white; basal half of inner web 
of the secondaries and of many of the primaries huffish white. Bill 
abnormally long, both mandibles obscurely serrated; the upper mandible 
curved considerably over the lower, dark brown, lower mandible 
slightly paler; rictal bristles long, numerous, but slender. 
"Wing with the fourth primary slightly the longest, second primary 
between the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1*7 to 1*5 inch. 
Leg", feet, and claws darkish brown. Length of wing 5*75 to 5*1 
inches, tail 3*7 to 3*1, culmen 1*6 to 1*3, tarsus 1*4 to 1*25. 

It is not known that any difference of plumage can be traced to 
sex or season. Young in first plumage have ochraceous shafts 
to the feathers of the head and back, ochraceous tips to the wing-
coverts and innermost secondaries, the underparts generally suffused 
with ochraceous, and more profusely spotted and barred. 

The faw-billed Ground-Thrush breeds in the Himalayas, from

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is russet-brown, approaching chestnut-brown on the 
outer webs of the quills, wing-coverts, and innermost secondaries; 
lores and ear-eoverts brown, with pale centres; no trace of eye-
stripe; tail russet-brown; chin and upper throat nearly white, 
bounded on each side by a brown monstachial line ; centre of belly 
white, the feathers gradually having broader and broader brown

margins, and smaller and smaller builivh-white centres, until, on 
the hides of the breast and flanks, (key become brown, with bull* 
shafts. Under tail-coverts brown, with white tips shading into 
chestnut at the edges; axillaries, basal half white, terminal half 
dark brown; lower under wing-coverts, basal half dark brown, terminal 
half huffish white; basal portion ot inner web of the secondaries 
and many of the primaries rich buff; inner margin of quills 
scarcely paler than the rest oi: under surface. Bill abnormally long*, 
dark brown above, scarcely paler below; rictal bristles numerous 
but slender. Wing* with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary intermediate, in length between 
the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1*25 inch. Legs, feet, and 
claws darkish brown. Length of wing 4*85 to 4*7 inches, tail 3*0 
to 2"9, culmen 1*34 to 1*3, tarsus 1*18 to 1*15. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the colour between 
the male said female, or between spring and autumn plumage. Birds 
of the year, possibly more or less of the second year, have oehraceons 
tips to the greater and median wing-coverts. Young in first 
plumage have pale shaft-lines and dark transverse terminal bars to 
the feathers of the back and upper tail-coverts, and the wing-coverts 
are conspicuously tipped with huffish chestnut. 

The Long-billed Ground-Thrush breeds in the Himalayas from 
Sikkim to Assam. It is also found in the north and central portions 
of the Tenasserim provinces, and has been recorded from Afghanistan. 
It is a hill bird, and is not known to be migratory.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dark brown, approaching black on the head and on 
the margins of the feathers of the back; the feathers of the lores 
and ear-coverts with pale centres; no trace of eye-stripe; ^ings 
and tail not quite so black as the back. Chin and upper throat 
white, with narrow transverse terminal black hands; checks pale

It in not known that there is any difference of plumage attributable 
to either sex or season. Youtuj in first plumtuje have pale 
oohraoeous shafts to most of the feathers of the upper parts, and 
fan-shapod, ochraceons terminal spots to tho wing-coverts. The 
underpirts are also much suffused with oohraceous, and the breast 
ami Hanks barred with black, the diamond-shapod pale centres 
being irregular in shape.

been mislaid. No other example is known. It is probably nearly 
allied to 67. crossleyi; but Cassia's description from which the above 
is taken is somewhat meagre.

It is not known that there is any difference between the plumage 
of the Quale and that of the female, or between the summer and 
winter plumage. Young in first plumage have pale streaks on the 
shafts of the scapulars, a nearly white chin and throat, and have ' 
the rest of the nnderparts considerably suffused with ochraceous.

In the adult male in spring plumage the head is browTnish chestnut, 
shading into orange-chestnut on the nape; the rest of the 
upper parts slate-grey; lores greyish white ; no trace of eye-stripe; 
ear-coverts and cheeks black, the feathers of the former with white 
bases; innermost secondaries and quills dark brown ; wing-coverts 
nearly black; median wing-coverts white; greater wTing-coverts

pale slate-grey; tail brown, the outside feather on each side 

broadly tipped with vrhite, and the next narrowly so. Chin, throat, 
and upper breast black; rest of the underparts white, suffused with 
ochraceous on the flanks ; the feathers of the lower breast with 
conspicuous fan-shaped black terminal spots, which become obscure 
on the flanks; axillaries, basal portion white, terminal portion dark 
slate-grey ; lower under wing-coverts, basal portion black, terminal 
portion white; basal portion of inner web of the secondaries and 
many of the primaries white. Bill dark brown above and below.

The adult plumage of the sexes appears to be alike, nor is it 
known that any important change takes place by abrasion. Young 
hi first plumage appear to have the whole of the tipper parts dull 
chestnut, each feather having a pale shaft and obscure pale centre ; 
the white bars on the wings are suffused with chestnut, and the black 
on the underparts is confined to t wo moustaehial lines on the cheeks, 
the rest being dull chestnut. This plumage is immediately moulted 
to the adult plumage in the first autumn, except that certain birds, 
which I take to be females, have the slate grey of the upper parts 
replaced by dark olive-brown.

In the adult wale in spring 2>hnnuge the general colour of the 
upper parts is russet-brown, shading into olive-brown on the head; 
lores pale grey ; no trace of eye-stripe ; all the median and most of 
the greater wing-coverts dark brown with white tips ; quills brown, 
the outside webs margined with russet-brown; tail-feathers russet-
brown, the two outer ones on each side with obscure pale tips, and 
frequently all obscurely barred with scarcely perceptible transverse 
bands. Underparts white, shading into brown on the flanks and 
sides of breast; car-coverts and the feathers on the cheeks, breast,

and a few on the flanks with nearly black fan-shaped terminal spots; 
axillaris, basal half white, terminal half brown; under wing-coverts, 
basal portion dark brown, terminal portion white. Bill dark brown, 
paler at the base of the under mandible. Wing with the fourth 
and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about 
equal to the eighth, bastard primary 0-9 to 0-85 inch. Legs^feet, 
and claws greyish brown. Length of wing 4-0 to 3*0 inches, tail 3*4 
to 3-0, culmon 0-91 to 0*8o, tardus 1 4 to 1-3, 

The pmaU is said to be less olivaceous on the upper parts than 
the male. Immediately after the autumn moult the prevailing 
colour of the upper parts of both sexes is russet-brown. Birds of 
the year probably differ little from adults. Young in the first 
plumage have ochraceous shaft-lines to the feathers of the upper 
parts ;' the spots at the tips of the wing-coverts and the groundcolour 
of the underparts are ochraceous. 

The Spotted Ground-Thrush appears to be confined to the central 
hill country of Ceylon, whore it is a resident, ascending the mountains 
to an elevation of 4000 feet, and extending its range on the west 
and south sides of the island almost to the sea.

In the adult male in spring plumage the head and nape are green 
oohracoous; the general colour of the rest of the upper parts pale 
slate-grey, each feather darker in the centre; no trace of an eye-
stripe ; cheeks white; a dark-brown band extends from the eye 
halfway to the shoulder; behind this is a white band extending 
nearly to the shoulder; behind this another shorter dark-brown 
band, leaving a small white spot at the junction of the ear-coverts 
and the nape ; wings and tail the same as in G. citrina. Uuderparts 
as in G. citrina, except that the chin and throat are white. Bill 
dark brown above and below. "Wing with the fourth and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary between the 
sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1*0 to 0*85 inch. Legs, feet,

to 2-8, culmen 0-0 to 0-85, tarsus 1-2 to 1-15. 

The female appears to differ from the male in having the upper 
back, scapulars, outer webs of secondaries, greater and lessor wing-
coverts, and innermost secondaries suffused with olive-green. In 
most cases the greater wing-coverts are tipped with orange-chest nut, 
leading to the supposition that they are birds of the year. No 
change worthy of note is produced by the autumn moult. Young 
in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

The "White-throated Ground-Thrush appears to be confined to the 
jungles of Central and Southern India, probably breeding in the 
former and retiring to the latter during the cool season.

In the adult male in spring plumage the head and nape are 
orange-chestnut; general colour of the rest of the upper parts pale 
slate-grey, each feather darker in the centre; lores and oar-eovcrts 
chestnut; no trace of eye-stripe ; quills and innermost secondaries 
brown, with the unemarginatecl portions of the outside webs slate-
grey ; lesser wing-coverts slate-grey ; median wing-coverts broadly 
tipped with white; greater wing-coverts and primary-coverts dark 
brown on inside web and slate-grey on outside web, generally with 
traces of white on the outside w ebs at the tip : t\\ o centre tail-
feathers and most of the outside webs of the remainder dark slate-
grey, the rest dark brown ; the outside tail-feathers are generally 
paler towards the tip, and frequently many of them have white tips. 
The underparts are orange-chestnut, occasionally approaching dark 
orange-chestnut, shading into white on the under tail-coverts; 
axillaries, basal portion white, terminal portion dark slate-grey; 
lower under wing-coverts, basal portion dark slate-grey, terminal 
portion white ; basal portion of the secondaries and some of the 
primaries white on the inside webs. Bill daik brown, paler at 
the base of the under mandible ; rictal bristles very short. Wing 
with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest; 
second primary generally between the fifth and sixth, sometimes 
between the sixth and seventh; bastard primary 1*1 to 0*0 
inch. Legs, feet, and claws flesh-colour. Length of wing 4-8 
to 4*4 inches, tail 3-15 to 2*83, culmen 0-05 to 0*8, tarsus 1 -35 
to 1-2. 

The female is supposed to resemble the male, except in having 
the upper back and scapulars suffused with olive-green and in 
having dark tips to the ear-coverts ; but as I find only three skins 
in this state of plumage in a series of thirty-two, I suspect it to be 
"-hat of the female in first year's plumage only. A bird in the collection 
in first plumage has pale shaft-streaks on the feathers of the 
iiead and back, and the underparts are dull and obscurely streaked. 
This bird is moulting on the middle of the back into the slate-grey 
of the adult. No important change in the colour of the plumage of 
the adult is produced by the autumn moult. 

Birds from Ceylon have been desciibed as a distinct species.
cannot learn that more than two examples have been obtained on 
this island, where it is probably onh an occasional winter visitant.

These skius agree in size and wing-formula with typical examines, 
but are somewhat darker in colour, though not quite so dark as 
(L rubecula. 1 do not think, however, that the Ceylon birds have 
the slightest claim even to subspeuific rank, as I have seen skins 
quite as daik or darker from Nepal and Burma. 

The Orange-headed Ground-Thrush breeds in the Himalayas 
from Nepal to Assam, apparently not ascending the mountains 
above 5000 feet. In the cold season it migrates to various parts of 
Northern and Central India and Burma, occasionally straying as 
far south as Ceylon.

This species is little more than a local race of G. citrina, Lath., 
and it will probably be found that intermediate forms occur, in 
Tshich case it must be degraded to the rank of a subspecies. It is 
a smaller bird with a more rounded wing, and darker in colour 
than the commoner species ; the general colour of the upper parts 
is a darker and duller slate-grey; on the other hand, the head, 
neck, and uuderparts are a darker but quite as rich orange-chestnut. 
"Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and

This is a smaller bird than 0. eitn'na, but resembles it precisely 
in colour, with the following except ions:—The slate-grey 
of the upper parts is slightly darker, but not so dark as in G, 
rubt'twltt; the crown, extending more or less onto the nape, is 
brownish chestnut, instead of orange-chestnut; the lores and chin 
are greyish white, instead of being nearly concolorous wiih the head 
and throat; there are only traces of pale tips to the tail-feathers, 
and the wings are without any white bar, the median wing-coverts 
being, like the rest, uniform slate-grey on the outer webs, and dark 
brown on the inside webs ; theundcrparts vary from orange-chestnut 
to dark orange-chestnut as in G. citrina. Bill, legs, cVo. as in G. 

citr'uia. "Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 

equal and longest, second primary intermediate in length between 

the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1*05 to 0*85 inch. Length 

of wing 4-2 to 3*8 inches, tail 3*1 to 2*0, culmeu 0*85 to 0*8, tarsus 

1-25 to 1-2. 

The famede differs from the male in having the upper back, 

scapulars, and the portions of the secondaries and wing-coverts which 

are slate-grey in the male suffused with olive-green. No change of 

importance is produced by the autumn moult. The ear-coverts of the 

female, and what I presume to be males in the first or second year, 

are obscurely tipped with brown ; but this disappears in what 1 

presume to be old males. Taunt/ m jlrst phimaye unknown.

Tlio female differs from the male in having the upper back &c.

that there is any seasonal change of colour worthy of note. Young 
in first plumage have pale, dull chestnut shaft-lines to the feathers 
of the head and hack, chestnut tips to the wing-coverts, and pale 
centies and obscure dark margins to the feathers of the breast. The

In colour it only differs from that species in having the head and 
nape rich dark orange-chestnut as in G. albogularis, and in having 
the wing without any Avhite bar, as in the last-mentioned species 
and G. andamanensis. From the two latter species, besides differing 
from the former in the colour of the throat and from the latter 
in the colour of the head, it is distinguished by its larger size 
and less rounded wing. Bill, legs, &c. as in G. citrina. Wings 
with the fourth primary slightly the longest, second primary equal

In the adult male in spring jrfumage the general colour of (ho 
upper parts is dark slate-grey, slightly darker on the head ; lores, the 
feathers behind the eye, and the ear-coverts nearly black • the eye-
stripe commences over the eye and extends to (ho nape, is very conspicuous, 
eleaily defined, and bright chestnut; quills brown, the 
unemarginated portion of the outer webs pale chestnut towards the 
base and apex; lesser wing-coverts dark slate-grey ; median wing-
coverts dark brown with large chestnut fan-shaped terminal spots; 
greater wing-coverts dark slate-grey, with large chestnut fan-shaped 
terminal spots on the outside webs; innermost secondaries dark brown 
with small dull-chestnut terminal fan-shaped spotb, the basal half 
of the outer w eb of most of them fringed with dull chestnut; tail 
brown, the outside webs margined with slate-grey, the outside 
feathers conspicuously tipped with white, the others less conspicuously 
so. Chin and throat chestnut, breast dark brown, nearly 
black ; rest of underparts chestnut, fading into neaily white on the 
centre of the belly and the centre and tips of the under tail-coverts; 
upper flanks pale chestnut, barred with pale slate-grey; lower 
flanks slate-grey ; under tail-coverts margined with pale chestnut; 
axillaries, basal portion white, terminal portion dark brown ; lower 
under wing-coverts, basal portion dark brown, terminal white with 
an occasional dash of pale chestnut. Bill dark brown above and 
below; rictal bristles unusually well developed. AVing with the 
third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary 1*0 to 0*8 inch. Legs, 
feet, and claws pale. Length of wing 5*0 to 4*8 inches, tail 3*05

The female differs from the male in being olive-brow n above whore 
the male is dark slate-grey • the chestnut of the underparts is paler, 
and the dark-brown pectoral band is nearly obsolete. No important 
change takes place in consequence of the autumn moult. Birds of 
the year have the plumage of the female in both sexes. Young in 

first plumage are unknown.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is black; lores and ear-coverts black• eye-stripe very 
clearly defined, white, extending to the nape • wing-coverts, innermost 
secondaries, some of the primaries, upper tail-coverts, and 
most of the tail-feathers more or less conspicuously tipped with 
white; quills dark brown, the outside webs nearly black, and edged 
with white for some distance, where they cease to be emarginated. 
Chin, throat, and breast black; the rest of the underparts white, the 
feathers on the flanks having broad, irregularly crescentic, transverse, 
subterminal black bands; axillaries, basal half white, terminal 
half black edged with white; lower under wing-coverts, basal 
half black, terminal half white; basal portion of inner web of the 
secondaries and many of the primaries white. Bill yellow above 
and below. "Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary between the fifth and sixth, bastard 
primary 0-9 to 0*7 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale brownish yellow. 
Length of wing 4*6 to 4*4 inches, tail 3*3 to 3*1, culmen 1*1 to 0*92, 
tarsus 14 to 1-0. 


The female has the general colour of the upper parts olive-brown; 
the eye-stripe and spots on the wing-coverts are smaller and ochraceous; 
the spots on the innermost secondaries and primaries are 
absent, and those on the upper tail-coverts confined to a few of the 
longest, and not quite pure white; the white at the end of the tail-
feathers is the same as in the male ; the feathers on the throat and 
upper breast are brownish white, with a narrow black margin, outside 
which is a fringe of olive-brown; the remainder of the underparts 
are white, each feather having a transverse ores cent-shaped

In the adult male in spring plumage tho general colour of the 
upper parts is dark brown, the feathers of the head, nape, and upper 
back with light shafts and pale outer webs, and the outside and 
longest upper tail-coverts broadly tipped with buffish white; lores 
and ear-coverts brown, with paler markings; some of the paler 
outer webs of the feathers behind and above the eye more pronounced, 
showing traces of an eye-stripe; outer webs of greater 
wing-coverts buffish. white, except towards their tips; innermost 
secondaries and primary-coverts paler towards the tips; primaries 
and secondaries more or less broadly tipped with greyish white; 
basal third of primaries, a spot at the angle of ©marginatum, and 
the basal portion of the margin of the outside web of secondaries 
white ; tail dark brown, tho outside web of the outside feather on 
each side white; all the tail-feathers broadly tipped with white,

centre of belly buflish white, shading into brown on the flanks; 
under tail-covcrts pale buff, the longer feathers paler and margined 
with brown; axillarics pure white, lower under wing-eoveits white 
with brown bases; basal half of inner web of the secondaries and 
many of the primaries white; inner margin of quills scarcely paler 
than the rest of the under surface. Bill dark brown above and 
below. Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and 
longest, second primary between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary

shorter than the longest. Length of wing o-2 to 4*8 inches, tail 
3-45 to 3-2, oilmen (K>1 to 0-81, tarsus 143 to 1-04. 

The female differs from the male in haying the pale markings on 
the head, nape, upper back, chin, throat, and breast more pronounced. 
The general colour of both the upper and under parts is 
also paler. In the young in first plumage the pale markings are 
still more pronounced, and the feathers of the rest of the upper 
parts have pale chestnut centres and tips, whilst nearly every feather 
of the underparts is pale ochraceous with a nearly black narrow 
margin. It is not known that the autumn plumage varies much 
from that of spring. 

The Mexican Ground-Thrush appears to be confined to the pine 
region of South Mexico, where it is supposed to be a resident. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species; 
but the descriptions have been taken from skins in the collections 
of Dr. Sclater and Messrs. Salvin and Godman.

The female differs from the male in having the upper parts olive-
brown, shading into dull slate-grey on the rump and upper tail-
coverts ; eye-stripe buff, shading into white on the nape; wings and 
wing-coverts russet-brown; underparts white, shading into brown 
on the flanks and into buff on the breast, each feather tipped with 
olive-brown. Males of the year are suffused with brown on the 
head and wings, and have ochraceous tips to the greater and somo 
of the median wing-coverts; the chin and throat are also suffused 
with ochraceous, and the throat and breast are barred. Females of 
the year have no trace of slate-grey on the upper parts, and have 
the greater and median wing-coverts tipped with ochraceous, like 
the male. Young in first plumage are unknown. 

The Siberian Ground-Thrush breeds in the valleys of the Yenesay 
and the Lena, between lat. 07° and 08°, and also near Yokohama 
in Japan. It winters in China, Burma, Sumatra, and Java, and 
has once occurred on the Andaman Islands.

This species is very closely allied to the preceding, and differs 
from it only in having the general colour of the upper parts pale 
brown instead of pale grey, and in having the white of the breast 
and flanks suffused with buff. There is no difference in the wing 
formula; bahtard primary 0*87) to 0*7 inch. Longth of wing 5*4 to 
4*83 inches, tail 2-9 to 2*55, cuhnen 1 • L to 0*02, tarsus 1-5 to 1/35.

The genus Tardus is very closely connected by intermediate links 
with the genus Merula, but as they both comprise a large number 
of species, the majority of which possess well-marked characters, it 
seems advisable to keep them distinct. In all the species of the 
genus Tardus the plumage of the male resembles that of the female, 
and the throat, breast, and flanks are more or less spotted at all ages. 
The bill is moderately stout, about the length of the head, somewhat 
widened at the base, and furnished with rictal bristles. The 
bastard primary rarely extends beyond the primary-coverts ; and 
the wing is generally comparatively flat and pointed. The tail is 
nearly even, and always consists of twelve feathers. 

So far as I have been able to ascertain, the young in first plumage 
of every species in this genus arc spotted on the back and breast; 
and I have never found them with a scutellated tarsus, except in the 
young of one or two species. The spring moult appears to be confined 
to the replacement of a few injured feathers. 

In summer these birds are principally ground-feeders, living upon 
worms and insects ; but in autumn and winter they chiefly frequent 
bushes and trees in search of fruit and berries. Their legs and feet 
are strong and generally pale in colour. 

The spotted plumage of the young is lost on the upper parts at the 
first autumn moult before migration ; but traces of it can generally 
be detected on the wing-coverts of birds of the year. 

This genus is by no means cosmopolitan. Eive species are known 
to breed in the Palajarctic region. Two of these encroach upon the 
Indo-Chinese subregion, which is otherwise unrepresented in this 
genus, as arc also the Indo-Malayan subregion and the entire Australian 
region. The ./Ethiopian region contributes nine species, the 
Paretic region ten, and the Neotropical region twenty-four. 

A comparison of this geographical distribution with that of the 
genus Merula is an additional argument for the advisability of keeping 
the two genera distinct.

Turdus maranonicus; Tacz. P. Z. X. 1880, p. 189, pi. xx. 
General colour of the upper parts olive-brown, each feather 
having an obscure dark margin (which may be the remains of immaturity") 
; median wing-coverts with pale tips of huffish brown (also 
a sign of immaturity); lores and "car-coverts showing pale centres. 
Ground-colour of the undcrparts pure white, slightly suffused with 
buff on tho throat and under wing-coverts; axillaries, centre of 
belly, and under tail-coverts purs white, the remainder of the 
feathers of the underparts with dark-brown terminal spots, which 
are fan-shaped on the chin and throat and halfmoon-shaped on the 
breast and flanks ; inner margin of quills huff. Bill daik brown. 
"Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the seventh and 
eighth, bastard primary 1-1 to 1-0 inch. Legs, feet,^and claws 
brown. Length of wing 4*55 to 4*5 inches, tail 3*75 to 3*(32, 
culraeu 0-9 to 0-88, tarsus 1*2. 
It is not known that any difference of plumage is attributable to 
sex or season. The bird described above is probably a male of the 
year. Young in first plumage are slightly more rufous in the 
colour of the upper parts, and each feather has a buff shaft-line and 
a dark-brown margin; the wing-coverts have fan-shaped terminal 
buff spots. 
The Peruvian Thrush has only been obtained in the valley of 
the Uaranon, in Northern Peru, where it is supposed to be a 
resident. 
The British Museum does not possess an example of this species. 
The only skins known to exist are in the "Warsaw Museum, from 
which the above descriptions are taken. 

2. Turdus bewsheri. 
Turdus 
bewsheri, B. Newton, P. Z. S. 1877, p. 299, pi. xxxiv.; 
Shelley, P. Z. S. 1879, p. 677. 

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is chocolate-brown, somewhat darker on the head and 
the inner webs of the quills and tail-feathers; lores brown; ear-
coverts brown, with pale shafts; traces of a pale buffish eye-stripe 
above the lores. Breast and flanks brown, shading into nearly 
white on tho chin, throat, and centre of belly; on the throat are a 
few indistinct brown streaks ; and many of the feathers on the lower 
breast and flanks have white centres; under tail-coverts brown, 
with white or buff centres running out to the tips ; axillarics 
brown, margined with white on the outside webs; under wing


* coverts chestnut; inner margin of quills scarcely paler than the rest 
of the under surface. Bill dark brown above, somewhat paler below. 
Wings with the fifth primary slightly the longest, second primary 
about equal to the eighth, bastard primary 1*2 inch. Legs, feet, 
and claws brown. Length of wing 4-3 to 4*05 inches, tail 3-16 to 
3*12, culmen 0*95 to 0*92, tarsus 1-6 to 1*52. 
2 . IT/EDITS. 189 
The female scarcely differs from the male. Birds of the year and 
young in first plumage are -unknown. 

The Anjuan Thrush has only been obtained on the island of 
Johanna, one of the Comoro group lying between Madagascar and 
Zanzibar. It is not supposed to be migratory. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species; 
but skins are in the collections of Professor ]Nrewton, Capt. Shelley, 
the Bremen Museum, and my own collection.

1855, p. 389; Hartl. Orn. W.-Afr. p. 75 (1857). 

General colour of the upper parts, including the ear-coverts, an 
almost uniform olive-brown, slightly darker and more russet on the 
head and lores. The underparts are pale olive-brown, the feathers 
of the chin and upper throat having brown terminal fan-shaped 
streaks, and each feather on the rest of the underparts having a 
terminal brown bar and a subterminal pale greyish-white band; 
the brown terminal bars become almost confluent on the breast and 
Hanks; axillaries and under wing-coverts dull orange-chestnut; 
inner margin of quills pale orange-brown. Bill dark brown, paler 
at the bate of the under mandible. "Wings with the third and 
fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate 
in length between the fourth and fifth, bastard primary 
0-9 inch, legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 4*95 
inches, tail 3*75, culmen 1*18, tarsus 1*55. 

Xothing is known of the differences which may be caused by age, 
sex, or season. 

The St.-Thomas Thrush is only known from the island in the 
Gulf of Guinea whose name it bears, and where it is supposed to be 
a resident. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species. 
The above description is taken from the type in the Hamburg 
Museum.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is olive-brown, darker and slightly suffused with russet 
on the forehead and crown; lores nearly black ; ear-coverts darkish 
olive-brown, each feather slightly paler in the centre; eye-stripe 
huffish white, very conspicuous, and extending to the nape; wings 
and wing-coverts brown, the outside web of each feather more or 
less broadly margined with olive-brown ; greater wing-coverts 
obscurely margined with chestnut-brown, and with ill-defined pale 
tips; tail olive-brown, the outside feathers with obscure pale 
margins to the inner webs. General colour of the underparts very 
pale buff, shading into white (or white slightly suffused with 
chestnut) on the belly and into rich chestnut on the flanks; the 
chin, the centre of the lower throat, and the centre of tho belly are 
unspotted; the cheeks, the upper part of the upper breast, and the 
lower part of the lower throat and the upper flanks have clearly-
defined, very dark brown, fan-shaped terminal spots on each feather, 
which are paler and obscurely defined on the feathers of the breast 
and lower Hanks; under tail-coverts white, the basal half of each 
feather margined with brown; asillaries and under wing-coverts 
rich chestnut. Eill dark brown, shading into brownish yellow on 

the basal half of the under mandible. Wing with the third and 
fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate 
in length between the fourth and fifth, bastard primary 
0*56* to 0-35 inch. Legs, feet, and claws yellowish brown. Length 
of wing 4-85 to 4*45 inches, tail 3*5 to 3-0, culmen 0-86 to 0-78, 
tarsus 1*25 to 1*15. 

In spring the slight chestnut shade on the greater wing-coverts 

2 . TU1WTW. 191 
has faded away, and the paler tips have been cast or ahradod, the 
spots on the breast have attained more definition, from the name 
cause, and tho general colour of the undcrparts has become purer 
white. Birds of the y< ar have the pale tips to tho greater wing-
coverts more pronounced, and clearly-defined white tips to tho 
innermost secondaries. Young in first plumage have also palo 
shaft-lines and dark-brown terminal bars to the feathers of the back 
and scapulars, all the wing-coverts have pale tips, and the spots on 
the under/parts are larger and extend further onto tho belly. 

The liedwing, or Eed-winged Thrush, breeds in the birch region 
and in the upper zone of the pine region from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific, though it appears to become very rare east of tho valley of 
the Yenesay, where it is found as far north as lat. 71°, beyond the 
limit of forest-growth. It has occurred in Greenland, but winters 
in the British Isles and "Western and (Southern Europe, occasionally 
crossing the Mediterranean into Algeria, and wintering also in small 
numbers in Persia, Turkestan, and North-west India.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is olive-brown; lores huffish hrown; ear-coverts buff, 
with black tips; eye-stripe huffish white, very indistinct, and soon 
losing itself behind the eye ; wings brown, with pale ochraceous 
brown margins to the outer webs; median wing-coverts conspicuously 
tipped with rich buff, greater w ing-coverts more obscurely so; 
primary wing-coverts with dark tips; tail brown. Chin huffish 
white* breast and flanks huffish yellow, shading into pure white on 
the centre of the belly; the feathers of the cheeks, throat, breast, 
and. flanks with black fan-shaped terminal spots, which are generally 
entirely obsolete on the chin and centre of belly; under tail-coverts 
w7hite, with the basal half of the margin brown • asillaries rich buff, 
greyer at the base; under wing-coverts rich buff; inner margin of 
quills pale brownish buff. Bill dark brown, yellowish at the base 
of the under mandible. Wings with the third and fourth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary between the fourth and 
fifth, bastard primary 0*6 to 0-5 inch. Legs and feet yellowish 
brown, claws darker. Length of wing 4-55 to 4*25 inches tail 
3-3 to 2-7, culmen 0-88 to 0*8, tarsus 1-35 to 1*3. 

The female is scarcely to be distinguished from the male. The 
abrasion which takes place during winter and spring causes the 
upper parts to be slightly greyer, much of the yellowish buff on the 

2 . TTJEDXTS.

breast and flanks disappears, and the spots on the underparts become 
smaller. Birds of the year arc slightly more ochraccous than adults* 
The young in first plumage are yellower above and below, and most of 
the feathers of the upper parts have pale contres and nearly black tips. 

The breeding-range of the Song-Thrush extends across the Palsoarctic 
Region from the Atlantic as far as the valley of the Yanesay, 
being, however, much commoner in the west than in the east. In 
Norway it is found north of the Arctic Circle ; but eastwards it has 
rarely been met with north of lat. (30°. In Southern Europe it 
breeds very sparingly, and only at high elevations. In many parts 
of England it is a resident bird or only a partial migrant; but 
it migrates in immense numbers to winter in South Europe and 
North Africa as far south as Nubia. The Siberian birds apparently 
winter in South Persia.

This Thrush is nearly allied to the preceding, but is perfectly 
distinct from it-, differing both in size, colour, and wing-formula. 
The upper parts are of a richer olive-brown; the spots on the 
greater and median wing-coverts are much more conspicuous, the 
terminal spot being nearly pure white, and the subterminal band 
nearly black; the ear-coverts and the feathers of the cheeks 
have very couhpicnous black terminal bands, which form a crescent 
on each "bide of the neck. The spots on the underparts are also 
larger, broader, and darker in colour ; and the axillaries and under 
wing-coverts are of a darker buff. The most important difference 
is, however, to be found in the wing-formula, the third, fourth, 
and iifth primaries being nearly eqnal arid longest, whilst the 
second primary it> very little longer than the seventh. This species 
is slightly larger than the preceding. Length of wing 4*7 inches, 
tail 3*8, culmen 0*9, tarsus 1*37, bastard primary 0*9. 

The female does not differ front the male. Birds of the year and 
young \n first plumage appear to be unknown. After the autumn 
moult the general colour of the upper parts is slightly more ochraceous. 


Pore David's Thrush appears to be a resident in Northern and 
"Western China. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species; 
but I have examined specimens in the museums of Paris and St. 
Petersburg.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the general colour of the 
upper pails is greyish brown, the feathers of the rump edged with 
ochraceous; lores and the feathers behind the eye greyish white; 
ear-coverts yellowish white, tipped with daik brown; no trace of 
eye-stripe ; wings brown with pale edges, ochraceous on the outside 
edges of the secondaries ; median wing-coverts with conspicuous 
greyish-white tips ; greater wing-coverts and innermost secondaries 
with obscure pale tips ; tail brown, the outside feathers very conspicuously 
tipped with white, especially on the inner webs; two or 
three other tail-feathers on each side less conspicuously tipped with 
nearly white. Underparts pale buff, darkest on the breast and 
flanks, each feather having a black terminal fan-shaped spot, cx~ 
cept the under tail-coverts, which are margined with dark brown on 
the basal half; the spots are also almost obsolete on the chin and 
the centre of the belly; asillaries and under wing-coveits pure 
white; inner margins of quills nearly white. Bill dark brown, 
yellowish at the base of the under mandible. "Wings with the third 
and fourth primaries nearly equal and slightly the longest, second, 

primary equal to the fifth, bastard primary 1*05 to 0*7 inch. Legs 
and feet yellowish brown, claws darker brown. Tail with the outside 
feathers 0*35 inch shorter than the longest. Length of wing 0*55 
to 5*4 inches, tail 4*75 to 3*9, culmen 1*1 to 0*88, tarsus 1*4 to 1*24; 

The female is scarcely to be distinguished from the male, but is 
slightly* paler above and below. The effects of the abrasions which 
take place during winter and 'spring are somewhat more conspicuous 
than usual in this species. The upper parts become greyer 
and paler; most of the buff and ochraceous tints on the rump, 
secondaries, and underparts fade away, and the spots on the underparts 
become smaller. Birds of Hie year are slightly more ochraceous 
than adults. The young in first plumage are yellower above 
and below, and most of the feathers of the upper parts have pale 
centres and black tips. 

The Missel-Thrush breeds in Central Europe, extending on the 
west coast as far north as the Arctic Circle. Eastwards it ranges 
through Turkestan, the North-west Himalayas, and Lake Bacial.

In Hnfflmid and some other mild climates it is resident; but by far 
the ltirgesfc number migrate to Southern Europe and North Africa 
to winter. In South Europe a few occasionally remain to breed. 
The Siberian birds apparently winter in South Persia.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is russet-brown, shading into orange-chestnut on the head 
and into olive on the rump and upper tail-coverts; lores grey ; ear-
coverts brown, with pale centres ; no trace of eye-stripe; wings 
and wing-covcrts brown, the outside webs of the feathers russet-
brown ; tail olive-brown, the tips of the feathers narrowly margined 
with white. Underparts white, with a slight shade of buff on 
the lower throat, each feather (except on the chin, centre of upper 
throat, centre of belly, and under tail-coverts) having a conspicuous 
very dark-brown fan-shaped terminal spot, paler and obscurely defined 
on the lower flanks; axillaries white, with brown centres ; 
under wing-coverts white with brown bases; inner margins of 
quills pale brown. Bill reddish brown, paler at the base of the 
under mandible. Wings with the third and fourth primaries nearly 
equal and longest ; second primary sometimes shorter, sometimes 
longer than the fifth ; bastard primary 0-9 to 0*45 inch. Legs, feet, 
and claws pale brown. Length of wing 4*45 to 3-85 inches, tail 2*9 
to 2-5, culmen 0*8 to 0-7, tarsus 1*28 to 1-12. 

The female does not appear to differ from the male, nor are the 
colours much brighter immediately after the autumn moult. Birds 
of the year have traces of pale tips to the greater wing-coverts. 
Young in first plumage are described as having pale yellowish 
shaft-lines to the small feathers of the upper parts and pale ochraceous 
tips to the wing-coverts.

Turdus auduboni, Turdus pallasi, and Turdus aonalaschkae. 

Some ornithologists make the above three forms specifically distinct, 
others unite them together as one species; wrhilst a third, and 
apparently increasing number, look upon them as subspecies or 
imperfectly segregated species, which probably occasionally interbreed. 
I propose to adopt the latter method of treatment, and to 
describe first the largest form, of which the synonymy is as follows

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is olive-brown, shading into russet-brown on the upper 
tail-coverts; lores brown• ear-coverts brown, with pale centres; 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries olive-brown, the primary 
wing-coverts margined on the outside webs with russet-brown; 
quills brown, margined on the outside webs with russet-brown; 
tail russet-brown. Underparts nearly white, suffused with buff on 
the breast, under tail-coverts, and under wing-coverts, and with 
brown on the axillaries and flanks ; the feathers of the cheeks, sides 
of the neck, and upper breast with fan-shaped dark-brown terminal 
spots, and those of the lower breast and upper -flanks with obscure 
paler brown fan-shaped terminal spots; inner margins of quills buff. 
-Bill dark brown, paler at the base of the under mandible. Wings 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest; 
second primary slightly longer than the sixth; bastard primary OS 
inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 4z-25 to 
3*70 inches, tail 3*25 to 2*9, culmen 0*74 to 0*66, tarsus 1*16 
to 1*13. 

The female does not appear to differ from the male. After the 
autumn moult the olive-brown of the upper parts is very slightly 
suffused with russet, but not sufficiently so to admit of its being 
called russet-brown. Birds of the year have pale tips to many of 
the wing-coverts. Young in first plumage have pale shaft-lines 
and obscure dark terminal bars to most of the small feathers of the 
upper parts, and ochraceous tips to the wing-coverts. 

The Mexican form of the Hermit Thrush is a resident in tlio pino 
regions of the southern Eocky-Mountains range from Great Salt Lake 
to Mexico, and has been obtained in winter in Guatemala and California.

This form is said to differ from the preceding in having the general 
colour of the upper parts slightly more rufous, and in having a 
fulvous shade on the flanks; but the distinction is based upon differences 
of colour so slight as to be only perceptible to an educated 
eye. It is, on an average, a smaller form. Length of wing 3-85 
to 3-30 inches, tail 2*8 to 2-4, culmen 0-7 to 0-62, tarsus 1*14 
to 1-05. 

The Eastern form of the Hermit Thrush is a migratory bird, 
breeding from Boston northwards to about lat. G0°, and extending 
westwards into the Rocky-Mountains range. It winters in the 
Eastern States from Boston to Florida and in Cuba.

* In consequence of Audubon having already described and figured this 
bird as Turdus minor, GrneL, his name "of Turdus names, which was founded 
upon a small example of the same species, 1ms been so extensively misapplied 
to the Western form of the Hermit Thrush that it is no longer available for 
the Eastern form, and must be rejected in favour of Cabanis's name, which is the 
next in order of date.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is almost uniform olive-brown; lores brown; traces 
of a buff eye-stripe above the lores and extending round the eye; 
ear-coverts biown, with pale buff centres. Under parts nearly white, 
shading into brown on the flanks, and suffused with buff on the chin, 
cheeks, and throat; the feathers of the cheeks, lower throat, breast, 
and upper flanks with brown terminal fan-shaped spots ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts buff, more or less suffused with brown ; 
inner margin of quills pale huffish brown. Bill dark brown, paler 
at the base of the under mandible. Wings wirh the third primary 
slightly the longest, second primary slightly shorter than the 
fourth, but considerably longer than the fifth, bastard primary 
0-6 to 0-45 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 
4*1 to 3-6 inches, tail 2-88 to 2-45, culmen 0-65 to 0*56, tarsus 1*13 
to 1-05. 

* According to the rules of the British Association, the name given by 
G-melin to this species should be adopted instead of that gi\en by Cabanis more 
than half a century later. Coues, in his ' Birds of the Colorado Valley' (p. 34), 
states that the name given by Gmelin had been previously applied to another 
species ; but I have been unable to discover any such application. The name 
of Turdus swainsoni, having been most generally used, I prefer to retain it.

TURMDiE. 

Tho female does not appear to differ from the male. After the 
autumn moult the olive-brown of the upper parts and the huff of 
tho cheeks, car-coverts, and throat is slightly richer and darker in 
colour. Birds of the year have traces of pale tips to the greater 
wing-coverts. Touny in first jplumaye are described as very similar 
to those of the nearly allied species. 

Tho Buff-breasted form of the Olive-backed Thrush breeds in the 
whole of Canada as far north as the Arctic Circle, extends westwards 
into Eastern Alaska and southwards down the Bocky-Mountain 
chain as far as the Great Salt Lake. It winters in Cuba, Costa 
Pica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It is said 
occasionally to pass west of the llocky Mountains, through California 
to Mexico and Guatemala.

has been used by the greatest number of ornithologists, and I therefore adopt 
it in preference to the older name gnen by Gmelin. Those writers who wish 
to harmonize this decision with the rules of the British Association must 
assume that Gmelin's diagnosis does not " clearly define " the species and that 
Stephens's does.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is russet-brown, greyer on the inner webs of the quills; 
lores grey; ear-coverts brown, with pale centres; no trace of eye-
stripe; cheeks, lower throat, and breast pale buff, each feather 
having a brown, somewhat obscurely defined fan-shaped terminal 
spot; rest of underparts white, shading into brown on the Hanks, 
and occasionally showing traces of pale brown or buff in other 
parts; axillaries white, with pale-brown centres; under wing-
coverts white, with pale-brown bases ; inner margin of quills pale 
brown, shading into white on the entire basal portion of the Inner 
webs of the quills. Bill dark brown, pale at the base of the under 
mandible. Wings with the third primary slightly the longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the ibuith and fifth, 
bastard primary 0*65 to 0*45 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale 
brown. Length of wing 4-1 to 3-8 inches, tail 3*0 to 2*7, culmen 
0*71 to 0-G2, tarsus 1*22 to 1*15. 

The female docs not differ from the male. 2STo important change 
is produced by the autumn moult. Birds of the year have traces of 
pale tips to some of the wing-coverts. Young in first plumage 
appear to be undesciibed. 

Wilson's Thrush breeds in South Canada and in the Xorthern 
and Central United States from the Rocky Mountains to the 
Atlantic. A few winter in the Gulf States; but the majority 
migrate further south, where they have been obtained in Cuba, 
Panama, and South America north of the Amazon.

In. the adult male in autumn plumage the head, nape, lores, ear-
coverts, and cheeks are black; general colour of the loinuinclcr of 
the upper parts dark brown, suffused on the margin of the outside 
webs of the quills and tail-feathers, and on the entire margin of 
the remaining feathers, especially at the nape, with olive-green, 
Underparts pale brilliant orange-yellow, most brilliant on the upper 
throat, shading into olive-green on the Hanks, and into greyish 
brown on the axillaries and under wing-coverts, and spotted with 
olive-green on the lower throat and breast; inner margin of quills 
pale brown. Bill yellow. Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate in 
length between the seventh and eighth, bastard primary 1 inch to 

0-9, not much more than a third the length of the second pnmary. 
Legs, feet, and claws pale yellow. Length of wing 4-0 to 3*4 inches, 
tail 3;05 to 2-65, oilmen 0*72 to 0-65, tarsus 1-4 to 1-35. 

It is not known that the female differs from the male. In spring 
the olive-green of the upper parts and the brilliant yellow of the 
underparts appear to fade, and the dark of the upper parts and 
the spots on the underpaits to intensify. Some of this difference 
may be due to individual variation and some to local race. Guatemalan 
birds are largest, and appear to be on an average the more 
brilliantly coloured; whilst a skin from Bolivia in Salvin and 
Godman's collection is the smallest, and has the black of the head 
replaced by dark brown. This may prove to be a bird of the year, 
a plumage of which, as well as of the young in first plumage, we 
have no information. It is highly probable that a larger series of 
skins may prove that this species must be subdivided into three 
subspecies—a large richly colouied form from Guatemala; a smaller 
form, in which the underpaits never have the rich yellow of the 
Guatemalan form, from Colombia and Ecuador; and a still smaller 
form, in which the head is brown instead of black, from Bolivia. 

Gould's Central-American Thrush frequents the forests of Guatemala, 
Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia, where it is said to be a 
resident.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the forehead and crown 
are slate-grey, each feather narrowly margined with brown, and 
having concealed black centreb ; nape palish slate-grey ; back and 
scapulars dark chestnut-brown, with obscure pale edges to most of 
the feathers, and more or less conspicuous dark centres; rump 
palish slate-grey, shading into a slightly darker slate-grey on the 
longest upper tail-coverts; lores and the ear-coverts immediately 
below the eye nearly black, the remainder of the ear-coverts slate-
grey ; traces of an obscure buff eye-stripe extending to the nape; 
wings and wing-coverts dark brown, with very narrow pale margins; 
primaries, primary-coverts, and a few of the outside wing-coverts 
with slate-grey on all or part of the outer webs; secondaries and 
the innermost wring-coverts with chestnut-brown on all or part of 
the outer webs, and generally paler and greyer towards the tips ; tail 
dark brown, slightly paler at the tips of the outside feathers. Chin, 

throat, and breast buff, each feather having a nearly black fan-
shaped terminal spot, nearly obsolete on the chin, narrow on the 
throat, but very conspicuous on the checks and breast; the sides of 
the breast and Hanks are nearly black, each feather broadly fringed 
with white ; belly white; under tail-coverts white, the basal half 
margined with brown; axillaries and under wing-coverts white; 
inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill yellow in summer, brown

in "winter. "Wings with, the third and fourth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary slightly longer than the fifth, hazard 
primary 0*85 to 0*05 inch. Logs, feet, and elaw»s very dark hrowu. 
Length of wing 5-9 to 5-2 inches, tail 4-3 to 3*85, culmen 0*02 to 
0*84, tarsus 1-3 to 1*2. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. In spring the casting 
of the'edges of the feathers produces a blight change : the hitherto 
concealed dark centres to the feathers on the forehead and crown 
become conspicuous; the huff shade on the throat and breast 
becomes paler and duller and the spots more distinct; the flanks 
also appear much darker, the white fringes to the feathers hating 
been reduced to half their original length. Birds of the gear scarcely 
differ from adults. Young in first plumage have light shaft-streaks 
and black terminal bars to most of the feathers on the upper parts. 
On the underparts the belly and flanks are spotted similarly to the 
breast. 

The Fieldfare, or Blue-backed Thrush, breeds in the birch- and 

pine-forests of the Palsearctio Eegion, from the Atlantic to the 

valley of the Yenesay, occasionally extending its range northwards 

beyond the limit of forest-growth, and frequenting also in large 

colonies the birch-regions of north temperate Europe. It winters 

in the British Isles and Southern Europe, occurring very rarely in 

the Spanish peninsula, but crossing.the Mediterranean to Morocco, 

Algeria, Egypt, and Nubia. In Asia it winters in Turkestan, 

Cashmere, and N.W. India.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is dark slate-grey, shading into russet-brown on the 
head ; lores dark brown ; ear-coverts russet-brown; no trace of eye-
stripe; wings and tail dark brown; greater wing-coverts and 
innermost secondaries margined with dark slate-grey on th e outer

In the adult male the general colour of tho upper parts is chocolate-
brown, somewhat darker on the head, and shading into slate-brown on 
the rump and into slate-grey on the upper tail-coverts; lores and ear-
coverts dark brown; no trace of eye-stripe ; wings brown ; wing-
coverts, outer webs of innermost secondaries, and uneniarginated portion 
of outer webs of quills russet-brown • tail brown. Chin white; 
cheeks and upper throat white, each feather having a fan-shaped dark-
brown terminal spot; lower throat white ; breast pale slate-grey, 
somewhat darker on the flanks, and shading into nearly white on 
the centre of the belly and into pure white on the under tail-coverts ; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts pale slate-grey, obscurely margined 
with white; inner margin of quills pale brown. Bill dark 
brown above, paler underneath. Wings with tho fourth and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the seventh, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*75 inch. Legs, feet, and 
claws brown. Length of wing 4*4 to 3*7 inches, tail 3*9 to 3*3, 
cnlmen 0*85 to 0*75, tarsus 1*22 to 1*2. 

The female does not differ from the male. Examples from 
Tobago are large, more olive in colour, and have the rump slategrey 
; but skins from Trinidad are intermediate. Birds of the 
year show ochraeeons tips to some of the greater wing-coverts. 
Young in first plumage have ochraceous shaft-lines and dark tips to 
most of the small feathers of the upper parts, and ochraceous centres 
and dark tips to the feathers of the underparts. 

The range of Cabanis's White-throated Thrush may be said to be 
South America north of the Amazon, including the valley of that 
river. It has been recorded from East and "West Guiana, the islands 
of Tobago and Trinidad, Yenezuela and Colombia, and is also found 
in North Brazil, Para, East Ecuador, and North-east Peru.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the head, rump, and upper 
tail-coverts are olive-brown, shading into yellowish olive-brown on 
the back; lores brown; ear-coverts olive-brown; no trace of eye-
stripe ; wings brown, the outside webs margined with olive-brown;

fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest; second primary 

between the sixth and seventh, occasionally between the seventh

brown. Length of wing 4*9 to 4-57 inches, tail 4-0 to 3*5, culmen 

0-JJ2 to 0-81, tarsus 1*25 to 1-1. 

There appears to be no difference between the sexes. Before 

spring the yellower tint of the back has faded away, and the general 

colour of the upper parts has become a uniform olive-brown; the 

olive lint has also nearly gone from the breast and flanks, which 

become an almost neutral pale brown. Birds^ of the year generally 

have oehraccous tips to some of the greater wing-coverts, and occa


sionally dark tips to some of the feathers of the breast. Young hi 
first plumage have the usual markings of nestling Thrushes. 

Swainson's Thrush is found in South Mexico and the greater part 

of Central America. In Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Eica inter


mediate forms occur.

This form differs from the preceding in having the upper parts an 
almost uniform dark slate-grey, with a slight trace of olive; the 
olive-brown of the underparts has become grey ; the axillaries and 
under wing-coverts are pale brown, dashed here and there with buff, 
and the inner margin of the quills is only slightly paler than the 
rest of tho under surface. The dimensions and the wing-formula 
are the same. 
This is apparently a local race \ and can only claim subspeciflc 
rank, inasmuch as every possible intermediate form occurs between 
them, the two extreme forms being comparatively rare. It is found 
in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Eica, and North-eastern Guatemala.

and under wing-coverts pale chestnut-brown ; inner margins 
of quills pale brown. Bill pale yellow above and below, darker at 
the base of both mandibles. Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to the seventh, 
bastard primary 1*05 to 0*8 inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. 
Length of wing 4-51 to 4*2 inches, tail 3*8 to 3*40, culmen 0*87 to 
0*82, tarsus 1-3 to 1*2, 

It is not known that there is any difference in the plumage of the 

sexes. Birds of the year have ochraceous tips to the greater wing-

coverts. Young in first plumage have the characteristic ochraceous 

shaft-lines to the feathers of the upper parts, ochraceous centres to 

those of the underparts, and dark tips to both. 

The Bare-eyed Thrush appears to bo confined to the north-west of 

South America. It is found in Colombia, Venezuela, the islands of 

Trinidad and Tobago, and in Guiana as far west as Cayenne.

Tn tlio adult male the general colour of the upper parts is brown, 

with a very slight tinge of olive or slate, somewhat darker on the 

head; lores nearly black ; ear-coverts dark brown ; no trace of eye-

stripe. Chin, cheeks, and upper throat huffish white, each feather 

having a long fan-shaped dark-brown terminal spot; lores, throat, 

and flanks pale buffish brown, shading into nearly white on the centre 

of the belly and under tail-coverts; axillaries and under wing-coverts 

pale buffish brown, obscurely margined with buff; inner margin of 

quills pale buffish brown. Bill yellow above and below. "Wings 

with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second

There is no difference in the colour of the sexes. Birds of the 

year and young in first plumage have the usual characteristics of 

immature birds of this genus. 

The typical form of the Common South-American Thrush has a 

very wide range, having been found in Guiana, Brazil from Bahia to 

Santa Catherina, and southwards to Bio Negro and Chili, in all 

which provinces it is supposed to be a resident. Intermediate forms 

appear on the Pacific slope of the Andes of Ecuador, and in the valley 

of the Tipper Amazons in Northern Peru, whilst in Colombia the 

extreme form occurs.

In the adult male in autumn plumage the general colour of the 

upper parts is russet-brown, shading into olive-brown on the rump 

and upper tail-coverts, and into slaty brown on the head and nape; 

lores dark brown; ear-coverts slaty brown; no trace or eye-stripe; 

wings brown; wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, and outride 

webs of quills russet-brown; tail brown, outside webs olive-brown. 

Chin and upper throat greyish white, each feather with long fan-

shaped daik-brown terminal streaks or spots; breast brown, 

shading into russet-brown on the flanks, and into white on the vent; 

under tail-coverts brown broadly margined with white: axilhiies 

and under wing-coverts bright chestnut; inner margin of quills 

pale chestnut-brown. Bill dark brown, slightly paler on the under 

mandible. Wing with the fourth primary slightly the longest, 

second primary between the seventh and the eighth, bastard primary 

1*0 to 0*9 inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 4v>3 

to 4*3 inches, tail 3*8 to 3-65, culm en 0*bo to 0*h3, tarsus 1*20 to

There is apparently no difference between the sexes. In sin/aner 

the russet-brown of the upper parts becomes greyer. Birds of the 

year have ochraceous tips to the greater wing-coverts. Young in 
first plumage resemble the young of the allied species. 

Spix's Thrush appears to be found throughout the north of the 
continent of South America, having been obtained from Colombia, 
Venezrela, Guiana, and Brazil as far south as Bahia.

The typical form of the Sabian Thrush is found in the north of 
South Ann riea, having been obtained from Ycnezuela, the island of 
Trinidad, and Guiana. Intermediate forms (of which, unfortunately 
for the technicalities of nomenclature, Liehtcn&tein's type happens to 
be one) occur in Amazonia, Para, and Eastern Brazil as far as 
Bahia ; whilst in Eastern Peru, in the valley of the Upper Amazon, 
occurs the extreme form.

This form differs from its ally solely in being somewhat darker

parts is replaced by dark chestnut-brown. The underparts are dull 
russet-brown, shading into brownish white on the centre of the

In the adult male in autumn plumage the general colour of the 

upper parts is an almost uniform dark russet-brown, very slightly 

darker on the head and considerably greyer on the inside webs of 

the quills; the general colour of the underparts is pale russet-

brown, shading into white on the centre of the belly, and obscurely 

streaked with darker brown on the chin and upper throat. Under 

tail-coverts white, with pale russet-brown bases and sides; axil


laries and under wing-coverts rich ochraceous brown; inner margin 

of quills pale chestnut-brown Bill dark brown above and below. 

Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 

second primary between the sixth and heventh, bastard primary 

1-0 to 0*8 inch. Legs, foot, and claws dark brown. Length of wing 

4-95 to 4-8 inches, tail 3-75 to 3-4, culmen 0-95 to 0*85, tarsus 1*2. 

It is not known that there is any sexual difference worth recording, 

or that any appreciable change is produced by abrasion. In young 

in first plumage most of the feathers of the upper parts have 

ochraceous shafts, and the scapulars and wing-coveits ochraceous 

tips. The underparts are also much suffused with ochraceous, 

especially on the breast and flanks, and most of the feathers have 

more or less obscure dark-brown tips; the inner margin of the 

quills is also more ochraceous. 

Lawrence's Sabian Thrush, the Central-American form of T. 

fumir/atus, appears to be confined to the provinces of Costa Eica 

and Panama in Central America, where it is supposed to be a 

resident. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species; 
but skins are in the collection of Messrs. Salvin and Godman and in 
my own,

This is an island form of T. fmnigatus, and differs from that 
species and from T. liauxwelli in having the general colour of the 
upper parts dark russet-brown, with scarcely any chestnut tint. 
Tho^underparts are slightly paler and greyer than those of T.hauxwelli, 
and much less ochraceous than those of T. fmnigatus; and most

of tlie feathers of tlie underparts have dark shaft-lines. In all 
other respects this species agrees with T. liaiuvwelli. It probably 
owes its claim to specific rank solely to the accident of its having 
"become isolated on an island and thus having no opportunity of 
interbreeding with its near allies. Length of wing 4*6 to 4*35 inches, 
tail 3-4 to 3*26, culmen 0*96 to 0*94, tarsus 1*32, bastard primary 
1-05 to 0-95. 

The St.-Yineent Sabian Thrush appears to be confined to the 
island of St. Yincent in the "West Indies. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species • 
but I have examined a skin in the Cambridge Museum, and the 
types in the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is uniform 

olive-brown; inside webs of quills and tail brown ; lores brown ; 

no trace of eye-stripe. Underparts uniform pale huffish brown, 

slightly paler on the centre of the belly, chin, and upper throat, the 

latter with long fan-shaped terminal browTn streaks; axillaries and 

under wing-coverts pale chestnut; inner margin of quills pale 

chestnut. Bill dark brown above and below. Wing with the third,

tail 3-9 to 3-55, culmen 0-93 to 0*84, tarsus 1-3 to 1*2. 

The female does not differ from the male birds of the year; and 

young in first plumage have all the characteristic markings of the 

same plumage of allied species.

titers of the nape brown with, black centres• back and scapulars 
slate-grey suffused with, olive, shading into nearly slate-grey on the 
rump; upper tail-coverts dark brownish, slate-grey; primary-coverts 
and quills dark brown, with narrow pale margins ; wing-coverts 
and innermost secondaries dark brown, shading into pale greyish 
brown on the margin• tail nearly black, the inside webs of the outside 
feathers on each side more or less broadly tipped with white. 

Cheeks black, pencilled with white ; chin and upper throat white, 
each feather with a broad black shaft-streak; lower throat, breast, 
belly, flanks, axiilaries, and under wing-coverts rich deep chestnut• 
feathers round the vent white ; under tail-coverts dark brown, with 
white shaft-streaks and tips. Bill yellow, dusky at the extreme 
tip. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal 
and longest; second primary intermediate in length between the 
fifth and sixth ; bastard primary 0*95 to 0*6 inch. Legs, feet, and 
claws dark brown. Length of wing 5*4 to' 4'9 inches, tail 4-12 to 
3*7, culmen 0*92 to 0*78, tarsus 1*35 to 1*15. 

The female differs from the male in being slightly paler in colour 
both on the upper and underparts. After the autumn moult the 
upper parts of both sexes are more suffused with olive; the black 
feathers of the head have olive-brown margins, the chestnut feathers 
of the breast have grey margins, and those of the belly white margins. 
Birds of the year have chestnut tips to most of the wing-
coverts. Young in first plumage have also white shaft-lines and 
black tips to most of the small feathers of the upper parts, and 
black fan-shaped terminal spots to the feathers of the underparts. 


American ornithologists distinguish between the Eastern and 
"Western forms of this bird, maintaining that the former is smaller 
with a much blacker tail, and with the white tips to the outside 
tail-feathers much more developed. After an examination of a large 
series from various localities, I am unable to discover any such 
distinction. I have both forms from California, Yancouver's Island, 
and Toronto. (Oonf Ridgw. Bull. 2NTutt. Orn. Club, 1877, p. 8.) 

The Red-breasted Thrush, or American Robin, breeds throughout 
the whole of Alaska, British North America, and parts of Greenland, 
up to, and occasionally north of, the Arctic Circle, retiring 
southwards in autumn, and passing the Bermudas on migration. In 
the United States and in the highlands of Mexico it is a resident, 
the numbers being largely increased in autumn, at which season of 
the year it occasionally strays to Guatemala and Cuba, and has even 
been recorded from Europe.

This species (founded upon a single skin) appears to be a desert 
form of the preceding, differing in having the general colour of the 
upper parts a pale greyish brown, slightly darker on the centre of 
the feathers of the head; the axillaries and belly are pale buff, 
slightly darker on the flanks and sides of the breast; chin and 
throat*white? streaked with greyish brown. Length of wing 5-1 
inches, tail 3*6, culmen 0*95, tarsus 1*25. Wing-formula the same 
as in the preceding. This supposed species may probably prove 
to be only an unusually pale example of the common one—in fact, 
an accidental variety. 

The only example known of the Cape-St. -Lucas Robin-Thrush 
was obtained at Todos Santos, in the extreme south of the Calif or nian 
peninsula. 

The above description is taken from the type in the museum 
of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

paler ; no trace of eyo-stripo; wings and tail brown ; wing-coverts, 
innermost secondaries, and outside v^ebs of quills and tail-ibathors 
the same colour as the back. Breast pale brown, shading into 
nearly white on the chin and upper throat, and into rich chestnut 
on the flanks, which becomes somewhat paler on the holly and under 
tail-coverts ; the chin and throat, and frequently the breast, have 
somewhat obscurely defined longitudinal streaks of darkish brown ; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts rich chestnut; inner margin of 
quills pale chestnut-brown. Bill dark brown above, brown below. 
"Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary between the seventh and eighth, bastard primary 
0*85 to 1*1 inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing

Examples from Buenos Ay res are more suffused with olive on 
the upper parts. 

The female does not differ from the male. Birds of the year and 
young in first plumage possess all the characteristic markings of tho 
same stages of plumage of allied species. 

The Chestnut-bellied Thrush appears to bo confined to the central 
and eastern portions of South America, having been found from Bahia 
to Buenos Ayres, and in the interior of Bolivia.

This species differs from the preceding, with which it has 
generally been confounded, in having ihe head chocolate-brown, 
and the rest of the upper parts rich russet-brown, slightly suffused 
with olive on the rump. The underparts are pale russet-brown, 
darkest on the breast. The ground-colour of the chin and upper 
throat is pale russet-brown instead of greyish white, causing the 
streaks to appear less distinct. The wing-formula of both species

Swain son's Yellow-legged Thrush appears to bo confined to the 
west coast of Mexico from the entrance of the Gulf of California 
to the Bay of Tehuantepec. It is common in the Tres-Marias 
Islands. It is a migratory bird, probably ascending to the tablelands 
to breed.

D'Orbigny's Yellow-legged Thrush is found on the west coast of 
South America, having been obtained in Ecuador, Pern, and Bolivia. 
It winters in the plains from June to October, and ascends to the 
plateaus of the Andes to breed.

replaced by brown, and have dark bars across the ends of the smaller 
feathers, and ochraccous spots at the tips of the wing-coverts. 
The Zanzibar Thrush has only been procured in the district whoso 
name it bears. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this -wellmarked 
species. The type is in the Berlin Museum, and specimens 
are also in the collections of Capt, Shelley and of the writer.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is dull 
olive-brown, shading into russet-brown on the forehead, somewhat 
darker and browner on the inner webs of the quills and tail-
feathers ; lores and ear-coverts brown; no trace of eye-stripe. 
Chin and upper throat white, with longitudinal dark-brown strcalvs, 
which become almost confluent on the cheeks; breast greyish 
brown, shading into bright orange-chestnut on the flanks and belly; 
under tail-coverts brown, with white centres running out to the 
tips; axillaries and under wing-coverts bright bunish chestnut; 
inner margin of quills pale chestnut-brown. Bill dusky yellow 
above and below. Wings with the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary between the 
seventh and eighth, bastard primary 1-0 to 0*8 inch. Logs, feet, and 
claws pale. Length of wing 5*05 to 4*45 inches, tail 3-9 to 3*4, 
culmen 1-0 to 0*9, tarsus 1-4 to 1*2. 

There appears to be no difference in the plumage of the sexes, 
nor does any change worthy of note take place by abrasion. Birds 
of the year have the wing-coverts tipped with chestnut, and most 
of the feathers of the upper and under parts with obscure black 
terminal bars. Young in first plumage have the usual ochraccous 
shaf o-lines to the feathers of the upper parts, and black terminal 
bars to those of the underparts. 

The Olive Thrush is found in the Transvaal, Natal, and in the 
Cape Colony, where it is a resident.

This is a northern form of T. olivaceus, and differs from that 
species in haying the ground-colour of the chin and throat the 
same colour as the breast. In all other respects (colour of soft 
parts, wing-formula, &c.) no difference is observable. Length of 

•vying 4-65 to 4*3 inches, tail 3*9 to 3-35, culmen 0*9 to 0*81, tarsus 
1-4 to 1-25. 
The female does not differ from the male. Birds of the year and 
young in first plumage very closely resemble "birds of the preceding 
species in similar plumages. 

The Abyssinian Thrush is confined to the highlands of Abyssinia, 
where it is said to be a resident.

This species is somewhat intermediate between T. olivaceus 
and T. pelios. General colour of the upper parts an almost 
neutral brown, with a slight shade of slate-grey. Chin, cheeks, and 
upper throat pale grey, somewhat obscurely streaked with brown; 
lower throat, upper breast, and flanks an almost neutral brown, 
shading into dull orange-chestnut on the belly; under tail-coverts 
brown, with pale shaft-lines and tips ; axillaries and under wing-
coverts bright orange-chestnut; inner margin of quills pale chestnut-
brown. Bill yellow. "Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate in length 
between the seventh and eighth, bastard primary 1-0 to 0*9 inch. 
Legs, feet, and clawTs pale brownish yellow. Length of wing 4*9 to 
4-55 inches, tail 4*1 to 3*7, culm on 1*08 to 1*0, tarsus 1*39 to 1*25; 
outside tail-feathers 0*3 to 0*4 inch shorter than the longest. 

There appears to be no difference in colour between the sexes, 
but females are on an average smaller in size. Birds of the year 
scarcely differ from adults. Young in first plumage (February) are 
much browner, with no trace of slate-grey, and have dark bars 
at the tips of most of the small feathers and ochraceous tips to 
the wing-coverts. One example has distinct scutellations on the 
tarsus. 

Cabanis's Thrush is found in the Transvaal and Kaffirland. An 
example obtained by Baron Yon der Decken, probably further north 
in East Africa, is somewhat browner above and more chestnut on 
the Hanks, and may prove to be distinct.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is pale 
slate-grey, very slightly browner and darker on the inner wobb of 
the quills and tail-feathers ; lores brown ; ear-coverts brown, with 
pale shafts ; eye-stripe somewhat obscure, pale buff, soon losing 
itself behind the eye; outer tail-feathers with obscure pale tips. 
Breast buff, shading into white on the chin, centre of belly, and 
under tail-coverts, and into bufflsh chestnut on the flanks; cheeks 
pale buff; upper throat with conspicuous very dark-brown streaks, 
principally at the sides ; axillaries and under wing-coverts bright 
huffish chestnut; inner margin of quills buff, very broad, almost 
Geocichline. Bill orange-yellow above and below. Wings with 
the third, fourth, and fifth, primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary about equal to the seventh, bastard primary 1*05

of wing 4-92 to 4*0 inches, tail 4-05 to 3*4, culmen 0*96 to 0*88, 
tarsus 1*34 to 1*16. 
Females are smaller than males, but do not differ in colour. 
Birds of the year and young in first plumage have the usual markings, 
as the bird named by Bocage is an immature example. 
The Kurichane Thrush has been obtained on the Loanga coast, in 
Angola, Damara Laud, the Bechuanas country, the Transvaal, and 
in the valley of the Zambesi. Nothing is known of its migrations. 
Examples from Angola are intermediate in the colour of the upper 
parts between T. libonyanus and T. tejjJironotus, and may prove to 
be a distinct species, in which case they will stand as T. verreauxi.

* I have examined Bonaparte's type in the museum at Leyden, and am convinced 
that it is the African species. The upper parts are greyish brown, not 
olive-brown. The tail is 3 5 inches long, and the second primary is equal to 
the seventh. Bonaparte described it as a Central-Asian species; but it is 
labelled " India." There can be little doubt that it is an African skin.

In the crtfwfo «i«7e tlie general colour of tlie upper parts is an 
almost uniform dull olive-brown, slightly darker and browner ou 
the inner webs of the quills and tail-leathers; lores brown; ear-
coverts brown, with pale shafts ; no trace of eye-stripe. Ohm,

brown, shading into creamy white on the centre of tlie belly and 
under tail-coverts, and into pale bunish chestnut on the iimkb ; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts bright butt-chestnut; inner 
margin of quills pale chestnut-brown. Bill bright yellow above

other small feathers of the upper and under parts with transverse 
terminal dark-brown bars. 

The ^Ethiopian Thrush is a resident in West Africa, from the 
Gold Coast to Loanga, and in the lowlands of Abyssinia and the 
Bogos country.

This species differs from the preceding in being a larger bird, 
without any bunish chestnut on the flanks, which are pale greyish 
brown. Length of wing 4*8 to 4*65 inches, tail 3*8 to 3*0, culmen 
0*9, tarsus 1*3, bastard primary 0*85. The wing-formula does 
not differ from that of the preceding species. 

It is not known that the male differs from the female. Birth of 

the year generally retain some of the ochraccous tips to tho wing-

coverts. Young in first plumage resemble that of the preceding 

species, but have only traces of buff on the breast and flanks. 

The Senegambian Thrush has only been found in the plains of 
the Gambia, in West Africa, where it is supposed to be a resident.

Typical species of the genus Merula have the plumage of the 
fully adult male different from that of the female. The females of 
this genus cannot, unfortunately, he distinguished from the genus 
Tardus, and the plumage of the males closely resembles that of the 
females until their second autumnal moult has taken place. The 
fully adult males have usually no spots either on the upper or under 
parts. The most aberrant species of the genus are M. nignscens, 

M. fuscatra, M. gigas, and M. gigantodes. These species have been 
separated by Dr. Sclater as a subgenus, to which he has given the 
name of Semimerula. In this group the colour of the plumage of 
both sexes is alike. If my view of the question be correct Dr. 
Sclater's name is a particularly unfortunate one, for not only have 
the males succeeded in attaining an unspotted adult plumage, as in 
the genus Merula, but the females also; so that a more suitable title 
for this subgenus would be Mendissima. J/, mandarlna is another 
aberrant species of this genus, showing in all examples which I have 
seen traces of spots on the chin and upper throat. In other respects 
it is a very highly developed Thrush, having nearly succeeded in getting 
rid of the spots on the upper parts of the young in first plumage. 
M. cardis, M. naumanni, and M. fuscata are also somewhat aberrant, 
inasmuch as they appear never entirely to lose the spots on the 
flanks; and in M. rujkollis and M. fuscata even adult males are 
found with a few spots on the cheeks. To the same slightly aberrant 
group also belongs M. atrigularisi which generally shows traces of 
indistinct spots on the flanks. The most aberrant species of all are, 
however, M. nigric&ps and M. reevii, in which the throat is striated 
with black. I should have placed these species in the genus Turchrs 
had it not been that they are slate-grey birds, nearly allied to 21. 
flavipes, with similar brown females. The diagnosis of the genus 
Merula must therefore stand as Thrushes not having a Geociehline 
wing, with the male markedly different from the female, except in 
a small group, where both sexes have the plumage unspotted. 

In what are called structural characters, and in habits, the genus 
Mend a does not appear to differ from that of Turdus. 

The geographical distribution presents several interesting points 
of difference. Neither the ^Ethiopian nor the Nearctie Region eontains 
a single species. The Neotropical Region contains sixteen 
species, the Australian Region twelve, and the Oriental Region 
fourteen, in addition to three of the Palsearctic species which reach, 
the Himalayas. The "Western Palsearctic Region adds only two 
species, whilst nine species are contributed by its Eastern portion.

wing-coverts vary from vinous brown in young birds to slaty brown 
in old birds. In the immature female the bill is brown, but becomes 
yellow in old birds. Malts of the year resemble adults, but have 
the bill black. Fthiahs of the year are more or less suffused with. 
-vinous red, especially on the throat and breast. 

The t/oniig in first plumage have most of the feathers of the upper 
and under parts with pale shaft-streaks—on the upper parts with 
obscure dark tips, and on the underparts with conspicuous dark 
terminal bar& ; on the lower back, rump, and belly most of the 
leather? have simply y>ale edges. In the male the prevailing colours are 
brown and pale grey, in the female reddish brown and pale chestnut). 

The Blackbird, or Black Ouzel, breeds throughout 
Europe south 

of the Arctic Circle, in Xorth Africa, the Azores, and eastwards 

into Per&ia and Turkestan. At the extreme north of its range it is a 

summer visitor only ; but otherwise it is a resident bird, subject to 

internal migration only from the hills to the plains in winter. Ex


amples from Turkestan measure 5-40 inches in length of wing, and 

may prove to be a distinct species.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour is an 
almost uniform very dark brown, nearly black: the feathers of 
the chin and upper throat always show more or less distinct pale 
edges, and the feathers of the underparts generally show traces of 
paler margins. Bill yellow. "Wings with the third, fourth, and 
fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary equal to 
or slightly shorter than the sixth, bastard primary 1*0 to 0-75 
inch. Legs, feet, and claws nearly black. Length of wing 6-2 to 
5-5 inches, tail 4-9 to 4*1, culmen 1-02 to 0*96, tarsus 1*5 to 1*35. 

The female scarcely differs from the male. Birch of the year show 
the paler brown edges to the feathers of the underparts more conspicuously, 
especially on the chin and upper throat. Young in first 

plumage have only obscure traces of the pale centres and dark 
margins to the small feathers, and pale tips to the large feathers so 
characteristic of the family, except on the underparts, where they 
are more conspicuous than usual.

is an almost uniform black. Bill bright yellow above and below. 
Wings with the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary about equal to the eighth, bastard 
primary 1*5 to 1*1 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale yellow. Tail 
with the outside feathers 0*35 inch shorter than the longest. Length 
of wing 5-0 to 4-56 inches, tail 4*56 to 3-8, cuhnen 0*92 to 0-9, 
tarsus 1-5 to 1*1. 
In the female the upper parts are a rich brown, shading into 
russet-brown on the upper tail-coverts, and approaching chocolate-
brown on the tail. The underparts, including the axillaries, are 
pale russet-brown, shading into chocolate-brown on the under tail-
coverts, and with obscure traces of darker stnation on the upper 
throat. Young in first plumage appear to be unknown,

In the female the upper parts are russet-brown, inclining to olive. 

The underparts are paler, with obscure streaks on the throat, and 

pale shafts to the under tail-coverts; the axillaries and under wing-

coverts are dull orange-chestnut, and the breast, flanks, and under 

tail-coverts are huffish brown. Young m first plumage hare the 

general colour of the upper parts brown, with ochraeeous shafts to 

the scapulars, and ochraeeous tips to the wing-coverts; the underparts 

are more ochraeeous, especially on the breast, axillaries, and under

be an island form. It differs from the latter species in having a 
somewhat wider bill. The colour of the male is a duller black 
without the greenish reflections. The colour of the upper parts of 
the female is a paler olive-brown, especially on the head. The 
chin and upper throat, unlike those of the female of M. leucops, 
are almost concolorous with the breast and belly, as are also tho 
centre of the belly and the under tail-coverts, the latter having only 
obscure pale ochraceous-brown centres, in strong contrast to the 
greyish-white centres and tips to the same feathers of the nearly 
allied species of the mainland. Bill yellow above and below. Wings 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the sixth and 
seventh, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*85 inch. Legs, feet, and claws 
yellow. Length of wing 4*5 to 4-3 inches, tail 3-5, culmen 0*8 to

This species has frequently been confounded with M. serrana, 
but differs from it in its smaller size, in its comparatively shorter 
tail, in its smaller bastard primary, in its shorter tarsus, in its more 
pointed wing, in the general colour of the male being more glossy, 
with distincter greenish reflections, and in the different coloration 
of the chin, upper throat, and under tail-coverts of the female. 

Adult male entirely black, with greenish reflections. Bill yellow.

In the female the general colour of the upper parts is darkish 
olive-brown, darkest on the head and palest on the rump; lores 
brown, ear-coverts olive-brown; no trace of eye-stripe; wings and 
tail brown; innermost secondaries olive-brown. Chin and upper 
throat pale olive-brown, each feather with a dark-brown streak

shading into greyish white on the centre of the belly; under tail-
coverts brown, with greyish-white centres running out to the tip; 
axillaries and under wing-coverts pale chestnut; inner margins of 
quills pale chestnut-brown. Birds of the year and young in first 

plumage

about equal to the seventh, bastard primary 1*3 to 1*1 inch. Legs, 
feet, and claws yellow. Tail with the outside feathers 0*1 to 0*3

inch shorter than the longest. Length of wing 5-6 to 5-3 inches, 
tail 4*9 to 4-5, culmen 0*98 to 0-9, tarsus 1-5 to 1-43. 

The female is slightly paler than the male. Birds in abraded 
summer plumage are not quite so dark a brown as newly moulted 
autumn birds. Young in first plumage have the usual ochraceous 
markings and spots on the upper parts ; whilst most of the feather 
of the underparts are dull ochraceous, with fan-shaped black terminal 
spots ; the axillaries and under wing-coverts are also obscurely 
margined with ochraceous, and the bill and feet are brown. 

Cabanis's Erown Ouzel has only been obtained in South Costa 
Bica and West Panama, where it is believed to be a resident.

Morula gigas and Menila gigantodes. 

This Ouzel has two extreme forms, which appear to be connected 
by a complete series of examples in every intermediate stage of 
colour. The synonymy of the Northern form is as follows:—

P.Z.S. 1875, p. 234; Salv. $ Godm. Ibis, 1879, p. 198. 
In the adult male the colour of the upper parts is an almost 
neutral dark brown, slightly suffused with olive on the back, rump, 
and upper tail-coverts. Underparts greyish brown, darkest on the 
throat and under tail-coverts, and occasionally slightly suffused 
with ferruginous on the axillaries. Bill bright yellow above and 
below. "Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary about equal to the tenth, bastard 
primary 2-0 to 1-4 inch. Tail with the outside feathers 0*6 to 0*4 
inch shorter than the longest. Length of wing 6*15 to 5'65 inches, 
tail 5*8 to 5-2, culmen 1*3 to 1*05, tarsus 1*85 to 1*68. Legs, feet, 
and claws yellow. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the colour of the 
plumage of the seres. Birds of the year, which have not quite lost 
their first plumage, have daik-brown terminal bars and pale-brown 
subterminal bars across the feathers of the throat and breast. 
Young in first plumage appear to bo unknown. 

The typical form of the Great Brown Ouzel is found in JNew 
Granada. Intermediate forms appear in Colombia and Ecuador.

1874, p. 503; Scl. 8f Salvin, P. Z. S. 1874, p. 677. 

This differs from the typical form in leing much darker and 
browner. The head, wings, and tail are almost black; the back, 
rump, and upper tail-coverts, throat and under tail-coverts are 
dark rich brown, slightly paler on the breast, belly, and flanks. 
Bill deep yellow. Wing-formula as in the preceding species; bastard 
primary 1*8 inch. Length of wing 5*8 inches, tail 5-5, culmen 
1*28, tarsus 1*6.

The female is supposed to resemble llio male. Birds of the year 
and young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 
The dark form of the Groat Brown Ouzel is found in Porn and 
Bolivia. 
The British Museum does not possess a skin of this form, but 
examples are in Dr. Sclatcr's collection and in my own.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is a rich glossy black, shading into brown on the forehead, 
and abruptly interrupted on the neck with a nearly white 
collar, which extends completely round the neck, and is more or less 
streaked with dark brown between the cheeks, leaving the rest of the 
underparts a dark sooty brown; under tail-coverts occasionally a 
uniform dark brown, but generally having white tips and shafts. 
Bill yellow. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary equal to or slightly shorter than 
the sixth, bastard primary 1*15 to 0*85 inch. Legs, feet, and claws 
pale yellow. Length of wing 5*8 to 5-1 inches, tail 4*55 to 4-0, 
culmen 115 to 1-03, tarsus 14 to 1-26. 

The female differs from the male in having the white collar pale 
grey on the hind neck, the general colour of the upper parts brown, 
and of the underparts brown obscurely barred with grey. The 
immature male resembles the female, but has the collar whiter. 
Birds of the year and young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

The "White-collared Ouzel appears to be confined to the Himalayas 
from Nepal to Assam, breeding at high elevations and descending 
lower in the valleys in winter.

ing black, except a gorget of nearly while extending across the 
lower throat from shoulder to shoulder; most of the feather** show-
traces of pale margins, which are conspicuous on the greater wing-
coverts and quills, the belly, and the under tail-coverts ; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts pale greyish brown with nearly white 
margins ; inner margin of quills brown. Bill yellow. Wings with 
the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 
primary slightly longer than the fifth, bastard primary 0*75 to 06 
inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 5*7 to 5*1 
inches, tail 4*5 to 4*1, culmen 1-0 to 0*9, tarsus 1*4 to 1*35. 

The female differs from the male in being dull brown instead of 
nearly black, and in having the white gorget suffused with brown ; 
bill brown. After the autumn moult the pale edges to the feathers 
are slightly more conspicuous. Birds of the year have very broad 
white edges to the feathers of the underparts; the gorget of the 
female is scarcely distinguishable and that of the male considerably 
suffused with brown. Young in first plumage have the back and 
breast barred with black and pale brown, and have ochraceous tips 
to the wing-coverts. 

The Eing-Ouzel breeds in the pine-districts throughout "Western 
Europe, but does not appear to range as far east as the valley of 
the Yolga. It winters in North Africa, Asia Minor, and Persia.

with the exception of the tips of the median wing-coverts, the outer 
webs of the greater wing-coverts, a broad margin to the 'innermost 
secondaries, and a narrow margin to the remaining secondaries, 
which are greyish white. The underparts are browner black, each

feather of the axfflaries, under wing-coverts, belly, flanks, and 
tinder tail-coverts narrowly margined with greyish white ; axillaris 
and under wing-coverts, sometimes one or both, greyish white. Bill 
yellow. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary intermediate in length between 
the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1 -25 to 0-85 inch. Legs, feci, 
and claws deep yellow. Length of wing 5*9 to 5-25 inches, tail 4-05 
to 4-1 (females 3-62 to 3*12), culmen 1-1 to 0*9, tarsus 1*41 to 1-27. 

The female differs from the male in having the black parts replaced 
by olive-brown and the greyish white on tho wings by brownish 
white-Birds of the year scarcely differ from adults, except that in 
the males the underparts are greyer and the greyish white on the 
wings is darker, and in the females the brownish white on the wings 
is russet-brown. Young in first plumage resemble adults, but have 
pale shaft-lines to the feathers of the upper parts and pale centres 
to the feathers of the underparts. 

The Grey-winged Ouzel breeds throughout the Himalayas from 

Kumaon to Assam, descending into the valleys during the cold season.

fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
equal to the sixth, bastard primary 0*7 inch. Legs, feet, and 
claws pale yellow. Length of wing 4-0 inches (female 3-9), tail 3-0 
(female 2-7), culmen 1*2 (female 0*8), tarsus 1*2. 

The female differs from the male in being very dark brown above 
instead of black. The underparts are a still paler dark brown, but 
have the same markings on the centre of the belly and under tail-
coverts. Birds of the year have traces of ochraceous tips to some of 
the greater wing-coverts. Young in first -plumage are unknown. 

The Mare Ouzel is confined to the island of that name, one of the 
Loyalty Islands. It was originally described as coming from the 
island of Yanikoro • but the localities given for birds obtained on the 
Voyage of the ' Astrolabe' have been in some cases found to be incorrect, 
and it may prove to be so in this case. The type in the Huseum 
of the Jardin des Plantes, in Paris, agrees exactly with a female in 
my collection obtained by Layard on the island of Hare.

In the adult male the head, nape, lores, and the upper part of the 
ear-coverts are dark brown, nearly black ; the hind neck, wings, and 
tail brown, shading into slate-grey on the back, upper tail-coverts, 
outer webs of the wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, and margins 
of the quills and tail-feathers. Chin and upper throat darkish 
brown, shading into dull vinous brown on the breast and into dull 
slate-grey on the axillaries, under wing-coverts, belly, flanks, and 
under tail-coverts, shading into nearly white on the centre of the 
belly; traces of pale shaft-stripes on the under tail-coverts, sometimes 
very conspicuous. Bill yellow. Wing with the third, fourth, and

inches, tail 4*1 to 3*5, culmen 1*06 to 0*98, tarsus 1*3 to 1-2. 
The female differs from the male in having the head, nape, and 
upper back an almost uniform brown, slightly darker on the head ; 
the slate-grey of the rest of the upper parts is slightly duller. On 
the underparts the dull white on the centre of the belly and on the 
under tail-coverts is much more developed, and the throat is pale 
brown obscurely streaked with dark brown. Young in first plumage 
appear to be unknown. 
The Black-capped Ouzel inhabits' South India and some parts of 
Central India, breeding on the mountains and descending into the 
plains during the cool season.

In the «rfotZi male the head and lores are dark sooty brown, 
approaching black, shading into dark ash-grey, which is the general 
colour of the rest of the upper parts, except the inside webs of the 
quills and tail-feathers, which are dark sooty brown. Underparts, 
including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, are almost uniform 
darkish brown, slightly paler on the belly, and with a few nearly 
white feathers near the vent. Bill orange. Wings with the third, 
fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
intermediate in length between the sixth and seventh,

The female scarcely differs from the male. The young in first 
plumage have pale shaft-streaks and dark transverse terminal bars 
to the feathers of the head, upper back, and scapulars, and most of 
the feathers of the underparts are similarly marked.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is sooty 
black, the feathers ob&cuiely edged with dark slate-grey; no trace 
of eye-stripe; wings and tail-feathers dark brown, approaching 
black, the outer webs broadly margined with dark slate-grey. The

The female is slightly paler than the male. Birds of the year 
retain some of the ochraceous tips to the wing-coverts. Young in 
first plumage have pale shaft-lines to the feathers of the head and 
back, pale tips to the wing-coverts, and pale centres and dark tips 
to the feathers of the underparts.

characteristics of the allied species in similar stages. 
The Puna Ouzel is only known from Puna Island, in the Gulf 
of Guayaquil, off the coast of Ecuador. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 

ux>per parts is dark brown, approaching black ; lores and ear-coverts 

the same; no trace of eye-stripe; nape deep rich chestnut. Chin 

and upper throat chestnut, each feather having a fan-shaped black 

terminal spot; lower throat and breast deep rich chestnut; re


mainder of the underparts, including the axillaries and under wing-

coverts, dark brown, approaching black; under tail-coverts with 

white shafts; inner margin of quills scarcely paler brown than the 

rest of the under surface. Bill bright yellow above and below. 

"Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and 

longest, second primary intermediate in length between the sixth 

and seventh, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*75 inch. Legs, feet, and 

claws yellowish brown. Length of wing 5*3 to 5*05 inches, tail 

4*2 to 3*8, culmen 0*93 to 0*89, tarsus 1*3 to 1*15. 

The female differs from the male in having the black parts re


placed by brown, and the deep rich chestnut by dull chestnut; the 

throat is striated with dark brown; the white on the under tail


eoverts, which in the male scarcely extends beyond the shafts, in 

the female forms a lanceolate white centre one third of the breadth 

of the feather. The colour of the bill is also pale brown. In some 

skins the underparts below the breast are black, each feather 

narrowly margined with pale brown. These I take to be males in 

autumn plumage. Some birds have the feathers of the head mar


gined with dark chestnut. This I take to be an individual pecu


liarity. The young in first plumage appear to be unknown.

This species is scarcely distinguishable from M. poliocephala. 
The fully adult male, however, will be found to differ from that 
species, if carefully examined, in the following particulars :—The 
pale brownish grey of the chin, throat, and upper breast does not 
shade gradually into the dark colour of the rest of the underparts, 
but is abruptly separated from it; and the rest of the underparts 
(except the axillaries and under wing-coverts, which are pale 
brownish grey in both species) are uniform dull black, without any 
brown edges to the feathers, and without the pale shaft-lines and 
tips of the under tail-coverts ; both the culmen and tarsus arc also 
slightly longer. Bill yellow. "Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the sixth, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*85 inch. Legs, feet, and claws 
yellow. Length of wing 4-25 to 3-9 inches, tail 2*8, culmen 0-94 to 
0-92, tarsus 1*41 to 1*32. 

The female has the head very dark brown, scarcely paler than the 
back. The *chin, upper throat, and ear-coverts are pale brownish 
grey, shading into dark brown on the lower throat, axillaries, and 
under wing-coverts, the rest of the underparts, including the under 
tail-coverts, being very dark brown, nearly black. Birds of the year 
appear to be unknown; but young in first plumage have pale shaft-
lines to the feathers of the head and back, and the feathers of the 
underparts have brown margins.

The Eromanga Ouzel is described as frequenting the mountainous 
parts of Eromanga, one of the most southern islands of the New 
Hebrides group. 

The British Museum does not possess a skin of this species; nor 
have I seen the type specimen, which appears to be the only one 
hitherto obtained. It is doubtful whether it is more than subspccifleally 
distinct from M. 2>ritzbueri, which varies considerably in 
the colour of the head, neck, and chest.

In the adult wale in spring plumage the entire head, neck, and 

throat are pure white, the rest of the upper parts dark brown, nearly 

black, slightly paler on the margins of the quills. Breast, axillaries, 

under wing-coverts, and flanks dark brown, shading into chestnut 

on the belly. Under tail-coverts brown, with very palo chestnut-

brown tips and shafts. Bill orange. "Wings with the third, fourth, 

and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary inter

of wing 4-5 to 4-25 inches, tail 3*26 to 2*9, culmen 0*9 to 6-8, 

tarsus 1-28 to 1-14. 

The female differs from the male in having the crown of the head 

and the general colour of the upper parts dark olive-brown. The 

forehead, an indistinct stripe over each eye, the sides of the throat 

and nape are mixed white and brown; and the general colour of the 

unclerparts is lighter; the axillaries and under wing-coverts are in


distinctly margined with chestnut. Birds of the year resemble the 

female, but have pale chestnut-brown shaft-lines on the feathers of 

the upper parts, and dark-brown terminal transverse bars to those 

of the underparts. Young in first plumage are unknown. 

The Formosan Ouzel appears to be confined to the island of For

I/Abbe David's Ouzel breeds in the pine regions of Kansu, in 
North-west China, where it is said to be migratory. Further south, 
m ^Test' Sechuen, it breeds in the pine regions, and descends into 
the cultivated valleys in winter. 
The British Museum does not possess an example of this handsome 
Ouzel. The types are in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes 
in Paris; and I have a skin of a male in my collection.

In the arfoZi m#Ze m spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is brown, with dark centres to the feathers, frequently 
intermixed, especially on the scapulars, rump, and upper tail-coverts, 
with chestnut; lores and ear-coverts dark brown; eye-stripe buffish 
white, broad and well-defined, and reaching to the nape; wings dark 
brown, most of the secondaries and wing-coverts broadly edged on 
the outer web with chestnut, in some specimens extending over the 
whole outer web; tail dark brown, frequently shading into chestnut 
on the margin of the inner web. Chin, throat, and cheeks buffish 
white, in old birds only showing traces of a moustachial row of spots, 
more conspicuous and extending across the throat in younger birds; 
breast and ^flanks dark brown, each feather narrowly edged with 
buflish white, except on the sides of the breast, which are uniform 
black; belly and under tail-coverts buffish white, with more 
or less concealed dark centres to the feathers ; axillaries and under 
wing-coverts pale chestnut with obscure white margins, browner in 
very old birds; inner margin of quills pale chestnut. Bill dark 
brown, paler at the base of the under mandible. "Wings with the 
third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
intermediate in length between the fourth and fifth, bastard 
primary 0*7 to 0*5 inch. Length of wing 5*3 to 4*8 inches, tail 4*0 
to 3'2o, culmen 0*9 to 0*84, tarsus 1*32 to 1*2. Legs, feet, and claws 
brown. 

The female differs from the male in having the feathers of the 
lower throat and breast greyish buff, with dark-brown fan-shaped 
terminal spots; the dark centres to the feathers of the upper parts 
are almost obsolete. After tJu autumn moult the white margins of 
the feathers of the breast and flanks are much broader. Males 
of the year have the plumage of the adult female. Young in first 

plumage have ochraeeous tips to the wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries; the feathers of the back have nearly black margins and 
pale chestnut centres ; the underparts resemble those of the female, 
but the spots are much larger. 

The Dusky Ouzel breeds in Siberia, from the valley of the Tenesay 
eastwards, among the willow bushes in the sheltered gorges of 
the tundra, above the limit of forest-growth, and in a similar climate 
on the mountain regions near Lake Baikal. On migration it passes 
through S.E. Mongolia and North China, and winters in Japan and 
South China, occasionally straying westwards as far as Assam and 
even North-west India. Individuals occasionally wander as far as 
Europe, having occurred in Belgium and Italy.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is pale greyish brown, the upper tail-coverts, the rump, 
and frequently the scapulars and occasionally many of the feathers 
of the back being more or less chestnut; lores brown; ear-coverts 
pale grey chestnut, tipped with black; eye-stripe pale grey chestnut, 
somewhat obscure, but reaching to the nape; wing-feathers 
brown, with pale narrow margins; wing-coverts greyish brown,

tail 3-7 to 3-35, oilmen 0-9 to 0*83, tarsus 1-31 to 1-2. 

The female differs from the male in having the chestnut of the 
throat and breast paler and obscured by dull margins to the feathers. 
After the autumn moult the feathers of the undcrparts have broader 
pale margins. Birds of the year have black fan-shaped terminal 
spots to the feathers of the upper breast, and ochraceous tips to 
some of the median wing-coverts. In other respects the male of 
the year resembles the adult female. Young in first plumage are 
unknown. 

The Eed-tailed Ouzel apparently breeds in Siberia somewhat 
south of the Arctic Circle, and winters in China. A few remain to 
breed at high elevations in the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal; and 
during the autumn migration a few stragglers, principally immature 
birds, find their way into Europe.

In the adult male iyi spring plumage the entire head, nape, and 
throat are nearly black, shading into dark slate-grey on the rest of 
the upper parts ; wings and tail brown, the outside webs edged with 
slate-grey; breast, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and flanks brilliant 
orange-chestnut, shading into white on the centre of the 
belly ; under tail-coverts white, with slate-grey sides. Bill yellow. 
"Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and 
longest, second primary equal to or slightly longer than the sixth,

inches, tail 3-45 to 2-95, culmen 0-96 to 0-87, tarsus 1*24 to 1-2. 

* The objection to the use of Myth's name is that be described the female, 
or immature male, as the adult male, and considered the adult male of Merula 
unicolor to be its female, in consequence of which both species have been confounded 
together under Blyth's name.

The female differs from the male in having the upper parts a 
nearly uniform olive-brown; throat nearly white in the centre, the 
feathers of the sides of the throat and chest with dark brown fan-
shaped terminal spots; rest of nnderparts as in the male. Males 
of the i/ear resemble females, and generally have traces of pale tips 
to many of the wing-coverts. Young in first plumage appear to be 
unknown. 

Cabanis's Ouzel breeds in the eastern Himalayas, descending into 
the valleys during the cold seasons. 

The Biilish Museum does not possess an example of this species. 
The typo in the Berlin Museum is an adult male; and skins of adult 
males are in the collection of Capt. Elwes, in the Tweeddale collection 
in the possession of Capt. Wardlaw-Ramsay, and in my own. 
The skin of an adult female or male of the year is in the collection 
of Col. Godwin-Austen.

eye-stripe; bastard wing, primary- coverts, and primaries dark 
brown• lesser, median, and greater wing-coverts, innermost secondaries,

breast brown; lower breast, flanks, and belly deep rich chestnut; 
thighs and under tail-coverts olive-brown, obscurely margined with, 
pale chestnut; axillaries deep rich chestnut; tinder wing-coverts 
chestnut and brown,* inner margin of quills scarcely paler than the 
rest of the under surface. Bill yellow above and below. Wing 
with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 
primary about equal to the ninth, bastard primary 1*4 to 1*05 inch. 
Legs, feet, and claws dark brown. Length of wing 5*1 to 4*7 inches, 
tail 4*1 to 3*6, culmen 1*1 to 1*0, tarsus 1*4 to 1*05. 

It is not known that there is any difference in the plumage of 
the sewes; the colours alter scarcely perceptibly by abrasion. Birds 
in first autumn plumage frequently show traces of chestnut terminal 
spots on the wing-coverts. I have not seen the immature bird in 
its spotted and barred plumage. 

Sclater's Red-bellied Ouzel is confined to the highlands of Colombia 
and Ecuador, where it is probably subject to some internal 
migration.

Ill the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is pale 
slate-grey, slightly shaded with olive on the head ; lores and ear-
coverts brown ; no trace of eye-stripe; wings arid tail brown, the 
outer webs of each feather pale slate-grey. The centre of the chin 
and throat nearly white, shading into greyish white on the cheeks

The female differs from the male in having the upper parts an 
almost uniform olive-brown ; the centre of the throat is nearly 
white, and the checks and chest-feathers have dark-brown fan-
shaped terminal spots: the rest of the underparts resembles that 
of the male. Males of the year resemble females. Young in first 
plumage are unknown. 

Swinhoe's Ouzel is supposed to be a resident in South China, but 
probably only winters there. It is doubtfully recorded from Japan; 
and will most likely prove to be identical with the allied species from 
the Amoor, in which valley it doubtless breeds.

In the adult male hi spring plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is pale greyish brown, the feathers on the head darker 
in their centres; lores nearly black; ear-coverts black, with pale 
tips; eye-stripe black, obscure, and not extending far behind the 
eye; wings and tail brown, each feather having a narrow pale 
margin; wing-coverts and outside webs of innermost secondaries 
the same colour as the back. Chin, throat, and breast black, each 
feather with an obscure pale margin; the rest of the underparts 
white, each feather, except those of the centre of the belly, having 
an obscure pale-grey centre; under tail-coverts white, the basal 
portion of the margin brown ; axillaries grey, with an obscure shade 
of chestnut; under wing-coverts buff, darker in their centres; inner 
margin of quills pale brown. Bill black, somewhat paler at the base 
of the under mandible. Wings with the third and fourth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary between the fourth and 

fifth, bastard primary 0*8 to 0*5 inch. Legs, feet, and claws dark 
brown. Length of wing 5*46 to 4-95 inches, tail 4*2 to 3*6, culmen 
0-91 to 0*81, tarsus 1*35 to 1*25. 

^ The female differs from the male in not having the black on the 
sides of the head and on the chin, throat, and breast; the feathers 
on the sides of the neck, upper throat, and breast have conspicuous 
dark centres, leaving the lower throat a uniform creamy white. 

3 . MERULA.

Males of the year have the plumage of the adult female. Young 
in first plumage have ochraceous tips to the wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries; the feathers of the back have nearly black tips 
and ochraceous centres ; the feathers of the throat, breast, and 
flanks have nearly black fan-shaped terminal spots; the groundcolour 
of the throat and the eye-stripe is ochraceous. 

The Black-throated Ouzel breeds in the pine-forests of the valley 
of the Yenesay, in Central Siberia, between lat. 60° and 03°. It 
probably also breeds in the same latitude in the valley of the Obb, and 
in a similar climate in the pine region of the Himalayas and Eastern 
Turkestan. It winters in "Western Turkestan, Baluchistan, and 
North India, occasionally straggling westwards into Europe, where 
it has been obtained in Russia, Germany, Denmark, Belgium, 
England, France, and Italy. Eastwards it has occurred on migration 
as far as Lake Baikal and, in winter, as far as Assam.

In the adult male in spring plumage the general colour of the upper 
parts is grey ; lores dark grey• ear-coverts grey; eye-stripe chestnut, 
narrow, scarcely reaching to the nape; wings and wing-coverts brown, 
edged with grey; centre tail-feathers brown, remainder chestnut on 
inside web and basal portion of outside web. Chin, throat, and breast 
chestnut, the margin of the feathers paler; the rest of the underpays 
greyish white, the feathers on the flanks with obscure darker 
centres; axillaries and under wing-coverts biinish chestnut; inner 
margin of quills pale brown. Bill dark brown, under mandible ye]lowibh 
at the base. Wings with the third and fourth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary between the fourth and fifth, 
bastard primary 0*7 to 0*5 inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. 


Length of wing 5*25 to 4*85 inches, tail 3*8 to 3*5, culmen 0*9 to 
0*85, tarsus 1*38 to 1*28. 


The female differs from the male in having very little chestnut on 
the throat and breast, which have the general colour of the flanks, 
with black fan-shaped terminal spots to many of the feathers. 
Males of the year much resemble the adult female, but have the 
throat and upper breast much darker. Young in first plumage are 
unknown. 

M. ruficollis and M. naumanni are very nearly allied. Both species 
have always a groat deal of chestnut on the tail. Adult M. naumanni 
shows more or less chestnut on the upper parts, especialfy on 
the rump, whilst there is no chestnut on the upper parts of immature 
M. naumanni or of M. ruficollis at any age. The chin, throat, and 
breast of both species are chestnut in the adult; but the moustachial 
line of black spots in M. ruficollis disappears at the second moult, 
whilst in M. naumanni it only disappears in very old birds. The 
only character that appears to be constant at all ages is the colour 
of the underparts below the breast. In M. naumanni these are 
always more or less marked with chestnut, whilst they are never so 
in M. ruficollis. 
The Bed-throated Ouzel is a Central-Asian bird, breeding in the 

3 . MEUCTLA. 271 
Himalayas and the mountains of Southern SLboria. Its principal 
brooding-quarters are doubtless somewhat south of the Arctic Circle, 
in Siberia. It winters in Turkestan, India, and China; and an 
occasional straggler has wandered into Europe

upper part of belly and under tail-coverts occasionally showing 
traces of buff markings. Bill yellow. Wings with the third, 
fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, bastard 
primary 0*9 to 0*7 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length 
of wing 4-9 to 4*25 inches, tail 3*45 to 2-9, culm en 0*95 to 0-81, 

tarsus 1*28 to 1-16. 
The female differs from the male in having the general colour of 
the upper parts olive-brown, shading into ash-grey on the rump 
and upper tail-coverts. The throat is much, and the breast slightly 
paler than in the male; all the feathers on the cheeks, and many of 

272 TTJEDIDJE. 

the feathers on the throat have dark-brown fan-shaped terminal 
spots; the axillaries are usually entirely deep buff; and the inner 
margin of the quills is usually buff. 

Birds of the year retain some of the pale tips to the wing-coverts. 
Young In [first plumage appear to be unknown. 

Examplos from the Eastern Himalayas, where the rainfall is very 
great, have the upper back of the male and the whole of the upper 
parts of the female russet-brown, and are slightly smaller than 
Western birds. If admitted as subspeciflcally distinct, they will 
stand as M. JiomocJiroa of Hodgson. 

Tickell's Ouzel breeds throughout the Himalayas, becoming rarer 
towaids the east. During the cold season it descends to the 
plains.

The Olive-backed Ouzel has only been recorded from the north of 
South America, between La Guayra and Caracas, about the centre 
of the coast of Venezuela. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this rare 
Ouzel. Skins are in the collections of Br. Sclatcr, Messrs. Salvin and 
Godman, and my own.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is olive-
brown, tinged with grey on the crown and nape; lores very-
dark brown ; ear-coverts slaty brown ; eye-stripe white, extending 
nearly to the nape; wings, wing-coverts, and tail brown, the outer 
webs of each feather olive-brown, greyer on the margins of the 
primaries and primary-coverts; outside tail-feathers obscurely 
tipped with while on the inner web* Throat and cheeks slaty 
brown, shading into olive-brown on the breast and into pale chestnut-
brown on the flanks, leaving the belly white ; under tail-coverts 
white, with the basal half edged with brown; axillaries and under 
wing-coverts pale slate-grey, obscurely tipped with white; inner 
margin of quills pale brown. Bill with the upper mandible dark 
brown ; under mandible pale yellow, darker towards the tip. Wing

with the lliird prlmaiy longest, second primary between the fourth 

and Jfiflh, bastard primary 0*6 to 0-5 inch. Legs, feet, and claws pale 

brown. Length of wing 5-0 to 4*4 inches, tail 3*6 to 3*0, culmen 

0*8S to 0*78, tarsus 1*2(5 to 1-1. 

Tho female differs from the male in not having the slaty tint on 

the crown, nape, and sides of the head; the throat is white, obscurely 

streaked with brown, and the flanks are very slightly suffused with 

pale chestnut-brown. In spring the general colour of the upper 

parts has faded from russet-brown into a greyer brown, which be


comes still moro grey during summer. 

Birds of the yea?- do not entirely lose the marks of immaturity 

until their second autumn moult; the wing-coverts and innermost 

secondaries frequently retain the pale tips, though these are white 

rather than ochraceous; the throat and eye-stripe of the female are 

much suffused with ochraceous, and the throat of the male resembles 

that of the adult female. 

Youmj in first jjkunage have most of the feathers of the upper 

parts with pale ochraceous shafts ; the feathers of the back have 

traces of dark-brown teiminal bars, and the wing-coverts and inner


most secondaries have pale ochraceous tips to the outside webs : on 

the underparts the feathers of the cheeks and breast have dark-

brown tips, which become less conspicuous on the flanks • the throat 

and eye-stripe are suffused with ochraceous. 

The Lark Ouzel breeds in East Siberia, between lat. 63° and 67°, 

in the valley of the Yenesay, and further east in the pine-region of 

Lake Laical and the valley of the Amoor ; it passes through China 

and Mongolia on migration, and winters in Assam, Malacca, and tho 

islands of the Malay archipelago. Stragglers occasionally are found 

as far west as Turkestan, Nepal, and Europe.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is rich 
russet-brown, tinged with grey on the head; lorob very dark brown ; 
ear-coverts brown; no trace of eye-stripe ; wings brown, the primaries, 
primary-coveits, and bastard wing-feathers with the outer 
webs slate-grey the secondaries, greater, median, and lesser wing-
coverts with the outer webs russet-brown. Tail dark brown, the 
outer webs of each feather margined with olive-brown ; inner web 
of outside tail-feathers white for half an inch at the tip; inner web 
of second outside tail-feather on each side with rather less white at 
the tip; more or less white at the tip of the third outside tail-
feather on each side. Throat and cheeks, breast and flanks slate-
grey, shading into white on the belly and the centie of the breast, 
and more or less irregularly shaded with brown on the lower throat, 
sides of the breast, and flanks; under tail-coverts white, with the 
basal half edged with brown; axillaries and under wing-coverts 
pale slate-grey, obscurely tipped with white; inner margin of 
quills pale slaty brown. .Bill dark brown, yellow at the base of 
the under mandible. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate in 
length between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary 0-75 to (>5 inch. 
Legs, feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 5*1 to 4*7 
inches, tail 3-9 to 3*3, culmen 1-0 to 0*9, tarsus P2 to 1-15. 

The female differs from the male in having the parts which are 
slate-grey replaced by russet-brown, and in having the centre of 
the throat greyi&h white, and the cheeks and sides of the throat 
with brown fan-shaped terminal spots. Males of the year have the 
plumage of the female, and the greater wing-coverts with more or 
less conspicuous pale tips. Young in first plumage are unknowTn. 

The Pale Ouzel breeds in the valley of the Lower Amoor and 
in Japan, and winters in South China and Formosa, occasionally 
straggling as far west as Assam.

The Brown Japanese Ouzel appears to be confined to Japan during 
the breeding-season, frequenting both islands. In autumn it occasionally 
strays to the valley of the A moor, and winters in South 
China, Hainan, and Formosa, occasionally straying as far south as 
Luzon in the Philippines.

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts, including 
the lores and ear-coverts, is an almost uniform dark brown, becoming 
dull black on the head, wings, and tail; no trace of eye-
stripe. Underparts dark brown, paler and greyer on the chin, 
throat, and thighs. Bill yellow. Wing with the third, fourth, and

The female differs from the male in having a shade of olive on 
the colour of the back, and in having the dark brown of the underparts 
replaced by dark vinous brown. Young in first plumage are 
unknown; but an immature male shows traces of first plumage in 
the chestnut tips to some of the wing-coverts; in other respects the 
plumage very closely resembles that of the adult female.

grey, shading on the nape into dark olive-brown, which is the 
general colour of the upper parts; wings and tail brown; the outer 
web of the wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, and quills dark 
olive-brown. Chin and throat creamy grey, shading into brownish 
grey on the breast; the rest of the underparts rich deep chestnut, 
shading into nearly white on the centre of the belly; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts brownish grey, with obscure chestnut edges; 
under tail-covorts brown, with pale chestnut-brown tips and shafts.

The female differs from the male in having the rich deep chestnut 
of the belly replaced by dull chestnut. The seasonal changes 
are probably very slight. The plumage of birds of the year is Unknown. 
Young in first plumage have ochraceons shaft-lines and

In the adult male the general colour of the upper parts is a uniform 
dark brown, approaching- chocolate-brown, obscurely suffused 
with dark olive on the back. This colour pervades the entire head, 
neck, breast, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and thighs, leaving the 
belly and flanks chestnut, marked with white on the centre of the 
belly and vent; the under tail-coverts are the same uniform dark 
brown, with broad white shaft-lines and tips. Bill yellow. Wing 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the sixth and 
seventh, bastard primary 0-85 to 0*7 inch. Logs, feet, and claws 
yellow. Length of wing 4*70 to 4*4 inches, tail 3*91 to 3*4, culmcii 
0-91 to 0*82, tarsus 1-&5 to 1*25. 

The female differs from the male in being of a paler brown ; the 
chestnut of the belly is replaced by brown, the white on the vent is 
nearly obsolete, and the white on the under tail-coverts is confined 
to a narrow shaft-line. Young in first plumatje have palo shaft-
lines and dark terminal bars to the feathers of the back and underparts, 
and the wing-coverts have ochraceous tips • the under tail-
coverts agree with those of the female. The type of 2\ jaiunncus 
and that of T. sehlegeU agree in the colour of the under tail-coverts, 
but the latter has the rich chestnut flanks of the adult m lie. It 
is probably an immature malo.

Tail of Mimocichla ardesiaca. 

The genus Mimocichla is a very small one, nearly allied to 
Turclus and Menda, bnt differing from them in having a much more 
rounded tail, with the three or fonr outside feathers on each side 
white at the tips for a considerable distance on the inside web. 
They are also remarkable for the broad pale borders to the secondaries 
and wing-coverts. The bill is slightly more slender than 
usual among the Thrushes, and the rictal bristles are small. The 
"bastard primary is small, and the second primary considerably 
longer than the secondaries. The legs are pjale in colour, and the 
tarsus unscutellated. 

These birds frequent dense thickets, and are good songsters, and 
appear to be all residents in the West-India islands.

General colour of the upper parts dark slate-grey, slightly paler 
on the rump and upper tail-coverts, the feathers on the head darker 
in the centres ; lores nearly black; ear-coverts as head; no trace of 
eye-stripe; quills, wing-coverts, and innermost secondaries black, 
with well-defined slate-grey margins to the outside edges; tail 

•black, 
the outside webs shading into dark slate-grey at the base, 
and the four outside feathers on each side tipped with white, the 
outside ones for an inch, gradually decreasing until it becomes only 
a spot on the fourth feather. Chin and cheeks at base of mandible 
white; throat black, the upper feathers with concealed white bases 
and the lower with slate-grey margins; the rest of the underparts, 
including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, are almost uniform 
slate-grey, with the exception of a few feathers near the vent, 
which have white tips j inner margin of quills slate-grey. Bill 
black. Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and

The Bahaman Mocking-bird Thrush is only known from the 

named this species Tardus plumbeus in his tenth edition. He appears subsequently 
to have made the acquaintance of the following species, and to 
have come to the erroneous conclusion that he had been misled in the information 
which he embodied in his diagnosis of the present species. In the 
twelfth edition he accordingly altered his diagnosis of Tardus phunheus to suit 
the new species. This conclusion was accepted by ornithologists, Gmelin attempting 
to cut the Gorclian knot by making tho black-throated species the 
male and the striped-throated species the female. During the next century 
no second example of the so-called male was discovered, and it was found that 
the so-called females were of both sexes. Gmelin's plausible theory was consequently 
found to be a case in which argument by analogy proved fallacious, 
and the Tardus plumbeus of the tenth edition of Linneus was voted a phantom 
species. Here, again, argument by analogy proved erroneous, for, after the 
lapse of one hundred and sk years, tho supposed phantom species was rediscovered 
by Bryant. I hare, for obvious reasons, rejected tho name which has 
been applied to both species altogether, and have adopted Vieillot's name for 
the striped-throated species. Tho black-throated species being thus left nameless, 
I have great pleasure in naming it after its rodiscoverer.

5. CATHARTJS. Type. 
Catkarus, Bonap. Consp. Av. i. p. 278 (1850) C. aurantiirostris. 

The genus Catharus forms a connecting-link between the Thrushes 
and the llobins; indeed C. graciUroatris is a typical Eriilutcm, 
so far as what are called structural characters are concerned; in 
general style of coloration, however, it so closely resembles the other 
Neotropical species, that it is probably more nearly related to them 
than to its Japanese cousins. The bill varies from very slender and 
black, through rather slender with pale under mandible, to stout, pale 
brown, yellow or orange; the rictal bristles are slender, and frequently 
almost obsolete. The tail consists of twelve feathers, and 
is slightly rounded. The wing varies considerably, some being much 

284 
TTTRDIDiE, 

more rounded than, others—in some species the bastard primary 
being small, in others about half the length of the second. The legs 
vary in colour from yellow to brown, and the tarsus is not scutellated. 


None of the species are known to be migratory. They frequent 
forests, where they are described as seeking their food on the ground. 
They are fair songsters. 

Three species are found in South Mexico, one of which ranges as 
far south as Costa Pica and one to Panama. One species is peculiar 
to Guatemala. Two species are peculiar to Costa Eica, and another 
ranges from Costa Eica to Ecuador. One species is peculiar to 
Panama, two to Colombia, one to Venezuela, and one to Bolivia.

[Catharus fuscater and Catliarns mentalis.] 

I am unable to decide, with the small series of South-American 
skins at my command, whether these very closely allied forms are 
specifically or subspecifically distinct. In my opinion the balance of 
evidence available is slightly in favour of their being conspecific. The 
northern form is more decidedly slate-grey in colour on the chin, 
throat, wings, and tail, which are more or less suffused with olive-
brown in the allied species.

In the adult male and female the head, lores, and ear-coverts are 
"black; quills dark brown, approaching black; the rest of the 
Tipper parts dark slate-grey, approaching black. Underparts pale 
slate-grey, shading into nearly white on the belly; inner margin 
of quills brown; the amount of white on the belly varies, and 
is almost entirely absent in a skin in Salvin and Godman's collection, 
said to be from Ecuador. Bill yellow, the upper mandible 
frequently dark brown. Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the ninth, bastard primary 1-15 to 0*9 inch, sometimes more and 
sometimes less than half the length of the second primary. Legs? 
feet, and claws pale brown. Length of wing 3-G to 3*35 inches

There is no difference in the colour of the plumage of the sexes, 
but, as will be seen from the measurements given above, the females-
have shorter tails. Birds of the year and young in first plumage are 
unknown. Examples from Ecuador average shorter in the wing 
than those from Veragua, but longer in the tail; they are also 
paler on the underparts, especially on the chin and throat. 

The Colombian Thrush-Eobin is a resident in the highland forests

claws brown. Length of wing 3*35 inches (female 3-2), tail 3*05 
to 3-0 (female 2*8), culmen 0-7 to 0*68, tarsus 1*4 to 1-3. 

The supposed female differs from the male in being somewhat 
more suffused with dark olive-brown, especially on the head. Birch 
of the jfear and young in first plumage are unknown. 

This form agrees in dimensions with the Ecuador form, but slightly 
differs in colour as described.

forest-clad spurs of the Andes in Eastern Bolivia, where it is believed 
to be a resident.

In the adult male and female the head, nape, lores, and the 
feathers immediately below and behind the eye are black, slightly 
suffused with olive-brown on the forehead; the rest of the upper 
parts dark olive-brown, still darker and browner on the inner webs 
of the quills and tail-feathers. Underparts, including the ear-coverts, 
pale slate-grey, very pale on the chin and throat, nearly white on 
the centre of the belly and under tail-coverts, and more or less suffused 
with dark olive-brown on the axillaries, under wing-coverts, 
sides of the breast, and flanks; inner margin of quills palish brown. 
Bill with the upper mandible dark brown, and the lower mandible 
yellow. "Wing with the fourth and fifth prima lies nearly equal and 
longest, second primary intermediate in length between the seventh 
and eighth, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*75 inch, about a third the

tarsus 1*35 to 1*25. 
It is not known that the female differs from the male. In what 
I take to be lirds of the year, the quills and tail-feathers are almost 
the same colour as the back, the black of the head is suffused with 
olive-brown, and the pale slate-grey of the underparts is replaced 
by pale brown. Young in first plumage are unknown.

The Black-headed Central-American Thrush-Robin is a resident 
of the forests offctouth. Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama, 
and is said to rarely ascend more than 3000 feet above the level of 
the sea. 

a. Ad. sk. Guatemala. J. Gould, Esq, 
[Catharus griseiceps and Catharus phseopleurus.] 

These two forms are very closely allied, but may perhaps be fairly 
entitled to specific rank, as, so far as we know at present, the 
slight differences between them are coincident with slight variation

from an intermediate locality, which is equally entitled to specific

The female apparently only differs from the male in having the 
upper mandible a dark horn-colour; in the abraded plumage of 
summer some of the russet and rusty brown disappears, and the 
back approaches olive-brown. Birds of the year do not differ from 
adults, except in showing ochraceous tips to some of the median 
wing-coverts. Young in first plumage have pale ochraceous centres 
and obscure dark terminal bands to the small feathers of the 
tipper parts ; the lesser and median wing-coverts have ochraceous 
tips; and the slate-grey of the unclorparts is replaced by very palo 
brown, each feather having a darker brown transverse terminal 
band. 

The Common Central-American Thrush-Robin is a resident in the 
highlands of the extreme south of Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa 
Rica. Examples from the latter locality are slightly less russet in 
the brown of the upper parts, and have the under tail-coverts less 
suffused with brown.

7. Catharus birchalli. 
In the general colour of the upper parts this form scarcely differs 
from C. melpomene, except that the rich rusty brown on the 
outer webs of the wing-coverts is replaced by russet-brown scarcely 
richer than the back. It is, however, very difficult to separate the 
least rusty-winged Central-American form from the most rusty-
winged Colombian form. Prom 0, aurantiirostris this form may 
be distinguished by the general colour of the upper parts being 
russet-brown instead of olive-brown, though here again the most 
rufous examples of C. aurantiirostris are scarcely separable 
from the least rufous examples of the intermediate form. Bill

[Catharus frantzii and Catharus alticola,] 

I do not think that ornithologists have done right to divide these 
forms into two species • but, in deference to the opinion of ornithologists 
who have made a special study of Neotropical birds, I admit 
them to specific rank, though the same principle carried out in the 
allied genera would greatly increase the number of recognized species.

This form differs from the preceding in having the head a paler 
rusty brown, and the rest of the upper parts inclining to olive-brown 
instead of russet-brown, the difteience being most strongly maikcd 
on the upper tail-coverts. The colours of the soft parts and the 
wing-formula are the same. Length of wing 3*45 to 3*15 inches,

This species differs from the two preceding subspecific forms, to 
which it is very closely allied, in the following particulars:—In the 
colour of the head it is scarcely distinguishable from C. alticola; 
the rest of the upper parts have, however, no trace of olive-
brown, as in that species, but, on the contrary, are as rusty 
brown as the head and very slightly paler, in fact paler and 
more rusty than in C. frantzii; the general colour of the under


pays is a slightly paler slate-grey than in cither of the subspecific 
forms above mentioned, and the throat and cheeks are 
suffused with brown, as well as the breast and flanks * ihe obscure 
traces of spots on the lower throat and upper breast are also slightly 
more developed and extend also to the checks. Bill daik brown,

Head, nape, and ear-coverts slate-grey; the rest of the upper parts 
russet-brown; inner web of quills and tail-feathers brown; the 
underparts, including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, slate-
grey, suffused with russet-brown on the breast and under tail-
coverts • inner margin of quills brown. Bill black, slender, resembling 
that of the genus Enthaais. Wing with the fourth, fifth, 
and sixth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary equal 
to the tenth or eleventh, bastard primary 0-9 to U*bo inch, about 
half the length of the second. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length 
of wing 3-0 to 2*7 inches, tail 2-5 to 2*2, culmen 0*6 to 0*55, tarsus 
1*3 to 1*22. 

The female is not known to differ from the male. Birds of tlie 
year have the head and flanks suffused with brown, the centre of the 
belly greyish white, and the chin, upper throat, axillaries, and under 
wing-coverts alone slate-grey. This may possibly be also the plumage 
of the female. Toting in first plumage have pale centres to 
most of the feathers of the underparts, and probably also to the 
small feathers of the upper parts. 

The Lesser Costa-Eican Thrush-Eobin breeds in the mountain-
forests of the province whose name it bears, and is not supposed to 
be migratory. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this aberrant 
species • but skins are in the collections of Br. Sclater and Messrs.

The genus Erithacus comprises a group of sixteen species, of 
which the Ruby-throated Eobin may be considered a typical form, 
and -which are very nearly allied to the Redstarts. The bill 
is slender, and generally black on the tipper mandible and paler 
on the under; the rictal bristles are small, in most cases nearly 
obsolete. The legs vary in colour from dark to pale brown. The 
tarsus is unscutellated, except occasionally in very young birds. So 
far as is known, the young in first plumage are spotted, but moult 
into nearly adult plumage the first autumn. It is not known that 
any of the species have a spring moult. The tail consists of twelve 
feathers, and is generally more or less rounded. The throat is 
frequently ornamented with rich colours, in some species having a 
metallic gloss; and the cheeks generally differ in colour from the 
throat. In habits these birds closely resemble the Redstarts, 
though many of them are more aquatic in their habits. 
Many of the species have very limited geographical ranges. 
Eight breed in the Western Palsoarctio Region, of which two are 
confined to Europe west of Russia, one ranges from Europe to 
Persia, three from East Europe to Turkestan, whilst one is found 
throughout Arctic Europe and Asia. Three species breed in the 
Himalayas, of which one extends north-west to Turkestan, and one 
north-east to North-west China. One species is confined to Central 
India. Two species breed in Siberia, of wbich one is confined to 
the east and the other is found across the country. Two species are 
confined to Japan and China, and one to the Corea.

General colour of the upper parts, including the car-coverts, 
russet-brown, shading into brownish chestnut on the upper tail-
coverts and tail. General colour of the undcrparis, including the 
lores, bumsh white, shading into greyish white on the breast and 
flanks, and into brownish white on the axillaries and under 
-wing- and tail-coverts. Bill with the upper mandible brown 
and the under mandible pale horn-colour; rictal bristles nearly 
obsolete. "Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary about equal to the fifth, bastard primary 
0*7 to 0-6 inch. Outside tail-feathers 0-2 inch shorter than 
the longest. Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 3*4 to 
3*0 inches, tail :2*75 to 2m5, culmen 0*62 to 0*55, tarsus 1*1 to 1*01. 

The female does not differ from the male, nor does autumn 
plumage vary much from that of spring. Birds of the year scarcely 
differ from adults. Young in first plumage have pale centres 
to most of the feathers. 

The Western Nightingale breeds in Central and Southern Europe, 
extending its range into the south of England, but rarely if ever 
found in Scandinavia or Bussia. It passes through North xiirica on 
migration, probably wintering somewhere in the interior south of 
Abyssinia.

This species differs from the preceding in being generally less 
russet in colour (more .olive), especially on the upper tail-coverts, 
in having a smaller bastard primary, a more pointed wing, and in 
being a somewhat larger bird. Bill with the upper mandible brown

In coloration this species is intermediate between the two preceding 
species, being slightly more olive than E. luscinia and 
slightly more russet than E. philomela. In its wing-formula it resembles 
the former species, but may easily be distinguished from 
either by its slightly longer bill and much longer tail. Bill dark 
brown above, pale horn-colour below ; rictal bristles nearly obsolete. 
"Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary about equal to the fifth, bastard primary 0*05 to

The sexes are alike. Birds of the year and young in first plumage 
are unknown. 

The Persian Nightingale breeds in the cultivated districts of 
Turkestan and "Western Persia, extending its range into the Caucasus. 
Its winter quarters are unknown.

General colour of the upper parts russet-brown, shading into 
chestnut-brown on the upper tail-coverts; wings brown, the outside 
webs of the quills and coverts margined with russet-brown; tail 
chestnut-brown. Unclerparts pale brown, the feathers of the breast 
and flanks with darker margins; lores brown; the feathers of the 
checks and ear-coverts with obscure dark margins, which become 
nearly obsolete on the throat. Bill dark brown, paler at the base 
of the under mandible. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the seventh, bastard primary 0*6 inch. Legs, feet, and claws light 
brown. Length of wing 2-56 inches, tail 1*85, tarsus 0*94, oilmen 
0-53, outside tail-feathers 0-15 shorter than the longest. 

The female of this species and the young appear to be entirely 
unknown. It is possible that the examples described above may be 
females, of which the male is undiscovered. 

Swinhoe's Eobin is only known from the type specimen (in my 
collection) from near Canton, and the example in the British 
Museum, the precise locality of which is unknown. I have not seen 
Hume's skin from Kumaon, but it also will doubtless prove to be 
this species.

Forehead, lores, ear-coverts, chin, throat, and breast bright 
orange-chestnut; general colour of the rest of the plumage olive-
brown, with a few grey feathers on the crown next the forehead 
and on the sides of the neck, and shading into nearly white on the 
centre of the belly; axillaries brownish white, with concealed dusky 
bases; under wing-coverts mixed orange-chestnut and pale chestnut 
; under tail-coverts white, more or less tinged with brown; 
greater wing-coverts with indistinct pale chestnut tips. Bill dark 
brown, paler at the base of the under mandible. Wing with the 
fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
equal to the eighth or ninth, bastard primary 0-92 to 0*8 inch. 
Legs, feet, and claws brown. Length of wing 2-9 to 2-6 inches, 
tail 2-5 to 2-2, culmen 0*55 to 0*5, tarsus 1*1 to 0*98. 

There does not appear to be any difference in the plumage of the 
sexes. After the autumn moult the colour of the breast is richer,

and the palo chestnut tips to the greater wing-coverts are darker 
and more distinct. Birth of the year scarcely differ from adults. 
Young injirst phnnaye have pale ochracoous ceni res and nearly black 
tips to most of the small leathers of both the upper and under parts. 

The Robin Redbreast breeds in most parts of Europe iu> far 
north as the Arctic Circle, and in many parts of Western North 
Africa. Where the winters aro severe it migrates southwards in 
autumn to South Europe, North Africa, Palestine, and the cultivated 
districts of North-west Turkestan. It is said to be a resident, 
though rare, in South Persia.

This species is very nearly allied to R rubecula, but differs from 
it in having the olive-brown of the upper tail-coverts replaced by 
chestnut. In all other respects, size, wing-formula, &c, the only 
difference I can detect is that the bill is slightly larger in the

Eastern species, the culmen measuring' 0-65 inch. The rufous of 
the breast is said to be deeper in colour• but the types were all 
obtained after the autumn moult, "when the Western species is 
similarly coloured. 

The female is said not to differ from the male,, Birds in spring 
plumage and young in first plumage are not known. 

The Persian Kobiii abounds in the forest districts of the southern 
shores of the Caspian, extending its range westwards into the 
Caucasus. Nothing has been recorded respecting its migrations.

and wing-coverts brown, and more or less brown on the edges of the 
feathers of the breast and flanks. Females of the year have the upper 
tail-coverts brown, and dark edges to the feathers of the breast. 
Young in first plumage appear to be unknown ; but & young male in 
September, which has probably not completed its first moult, has 
brown lores, cheeks, and car-coverts like the female, showing pale 
centres to the feathers. 

The Siberian Blue Eobin breeds in Eastern Siberia, from lake 
Baical to the mouth of the Amoor. It winters in Xorth India, China,

Adult male. General colour of the upper parts a uniform olive-

brown, slightly darkest on the head and ear-coverts; lores black; 

eye-stripes white, meeting in a narrow line over the forehead, and 

not extending beyond the eye ; cheeks white, separated by a narrow 

dark-brown moustachial line from the chin and throat, which are 

brilliant glossy scarlet; breast ash-grey, shading into nearly white 

on the centre of the belly, and into brown on the flanks and thighs; 

under tail-coverts, axillaries, and under wing-coverts very pale buff. 

Bill black. "Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 

equal and longest, second primary equal to the sixth or seventh, 

bastard primary 0*95 to 0*9 inch. Legs, feet, and claws brown. 

Length of wing 3-15 to 2*85 inches, tail 2-4 to 2'2o7 culmen 0-05, 

tarsus 1-2 to 1*0. 

The female differs from the male in having the white eye-stripe 

and cheeks pale brown, the black lores and moustachial line brown, 

the carmine chin and throat pale bro^ n, and the ash-grey breast 

brown. Birds of the year have the brown of both the upper and 

under parts more ochraceous, and the male resembles the female, ex


cept in having traces of red on the throat. Young in first plumage 

appear to be unknown. 

The Siberian Buby-throated Bobin breeds throughout Siberia as 

far north as the Arctic Circle, extending southwards as far as the 

extreme north of China. It winters in the Philippine Islands, South 

China, Burmah, and in Northern and Central India, occasionally 

straying into Europe.

-4^Zi male. General colour of the upper parts, including the ear-
coverts and the sides of the neck, a uniform dark slate-grey, shading 
into brown on the crown ; lores black; eye-stripes white, meeting 
in a narrow line over the forehead, extending slightly behind the 
eye; wings brown, the outer webs of the wing-coverts slate-grey; 
tail with sometimes two and sometimes four centre feathers plain 
brown, the remaining feathers dark brown, with the basal half, sometimes 
of both webs and sometimes only of the inside webs, and a conspicuous 
terminal spot white. Chin and upper throat glossy scarlet; 
cheeks, lower throat, and upper breast dull black; belly and under 
tail-coverts white, shading into slate-grey on the flanks., axillaries, 
and under wing-coverts. Bill black; rictal bristles almost obsolete. 
Wing with the third to the sixth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary about equal to the tenth, bastard primary 1-1 to 
0*9 inch, more than half the length of the second. Legs, feet, and 
claws brown. Length of wing 2*9 to 2*7 inches, tail 2-2^ to 2-0, 
culmen 0*65 to 0*6, tarsus 1*25 to 1-2• outside tail-feathers 0*4 inch 
shorter than the longest. 
The female differs from the male in having the general colour of 
the upper parts a uniform earthy brown; the black on the lores, 
cheeks, lower throat, and upper breast is replaced by greyish brown, 
and the scarlet of the chin and upper throat by greyish white; the 
slate-grey of the flanks, axillaries, and under wing-coverts is replaced 
by brown; the whole of the tail-feathers are brown, including the 
basal portions, which are white in the male, but the white terminal 
spots are retained, though less conspicuously. It is not known that 
any material change of colour is produced by the autumn moult. It 
is not known that females of the year differ from adults; but males 
of the year have the parts which are black in the adult replaced by 
slate-grey, and those which are scarlet by greyish white. The upper 
parts resemble those of the female, except the tail, which resembles 
that of the adult male. Toting in first plumage resemble the female, 
but have pale centres and nearly black edges to most of the small 
feathers. 
The Indian Euby-throated Bobin breeds in the pine-districts of

greater wing-coverts and innermost secondaries olive-brown; tail 

nearly black, the two centre feathers entirely so, the next on each 

side tipped with white, the remaining four on each side with the 

basal half white, excej3t the outside web of the outside feather on 

each side and a large white spot at the tip; cheeks white, edged 

with black. Chin and throat glossy scarlet; breast black; axillaries, 

under wing-coverts, and flanks slate-grey; belly and under tail-

coverts white, the latter with slate-grey bases. Bill black. Wings 

with the fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and longest, 

second primary about equal to the tenth, bastard primary 1 '25 to 

1*15 inch. Legs, feet, and claws dark brown. Length of wing 3*25 

to 2-9 inches, tail 2-5 to 24, oilmen 0-66 to 0*6, tarsus 1*32 to 1*25. 

The female is described by Prjevalsky as having the upper parts 

dark olive, with white eye-stripe and black lores; the underparts 

dirty white; the tail dark olive, without the white bases wThich 

characterize the male, and with the terminal white spots much 

smaller. Birds of the year, and young hi first plumage, appear to 

bo unknown. 

The Thibet Ruby-throated Robin has hitherto only been found in 

Kansu and Bikkim. It probably breeds in the pine-regions of these 

and the intervening country, descending into the valleys during the 

cold season.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour of the upper 
parts brown, each, feather slightly darkest in the centre, especially 
on the head and upper tail-coverts; lores dark brown, sometimes 
black; ear-coverts dark brown ; eye-stripe white or buff; wings 
brown, slightly paler on the edges of each feather ; tail dark brown, 
the terminal three fifths of each feather, except the two centre ones, 
chestnut. Chin, cheeks, throat, and upper breast metallic cobalt-blue,

with a large chestnut spot in the centre of tho lower throat; below* 
the blue a band of black, and below that a band of chestnut occupying 
tho lower breast; the rest of the undorparts, including the 
axiliaries and under wing-coverts, buffish white. Bill black ; riefcal 
bristles very small Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the sixth, bastard primary 0 8 to 0*65 inch; outside tail-feathers 
0*2 inch shorter than the longest. Legs, feet, and claws dark brown. 
Length of wing 3-2 to 2*8 inches, tail 2 4 to 2*1, culmen 0*6 to 0-55, 
tarsus 1-1 to 1*05. 

The female differs from the male in having the whole of the 
underparts buffish white, the cheeks continued in a band across 
the breast being dark brown. Old females have occasionally some 
of the blue and chestnut markings of the male. After the autumn 
moult the feathers of the chin, throat, and breast have white 
margins, which are cast in spring. Males of the year resemble the 
female. Young in first plumage have all the small feathers nearly 
black with pale chestnut centres, which are palest and most predominant 
on the belly; the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries 
have broad pale chestnut margins and tips, and the upper tail-
coverts are chestnut. 

The Arctic Blue-throated Eobin breeds within the Arctic Circle, 
or m the birch-regions at high elevations of more southerly climes, 
in both Europe and Asia, in the latter continent as far south as 
Northern Cashmere, occasionally crossing Behring's Straits into 
Alaska. It winters in North Africa as far south as Abyssinia, and 
in India and South China.

This species differs from the preceding solely in having the large 
spot in the centre of the lower throat pure silky white instead of 
chestnut, or in wanting it altogether. No difference is traceable 
in dimensions, wing-formula, or in the changes of plumage. The 
geographical range, however, is entirely distinct. 

The European Blue-throated Eobin breeds in Central Europe, 
and is rarely found during the breeding-season as far east as Russia. 
It passes through Southern Europe on migration, and winters in 
Palestine and North Africa. Stray examples have been known to 
wander as far east as Persia and India.

Bill of Monticola cyanus. 
The genus Monticola comprises a small group of birds which connect 


7. MONTICOLA.

the Ousels -with the Chats. Like the former the adult males are 
unspotted on the underparts, and, like the latter, the hill is long 
and the tail is short, the tail never being four times the length of 
the culmen. One species (M. erytJiroyastro), however, is aberrant 
in this respect. All the species have'blue chins and throats and 
chestnut breasts and bellies, except one, in which the chin and throat 
are chestnut and white, and one in which the breast and belly are also 
blue. The bill and legs are black, with one exception, in which the 
legs are brown. The rictal bristles are very small. The female 
always differs from the male, and has the underparts barred with 
both pale and dark bars except in one species. 

The Rock-Thrushes arc Saxieoline in their habits, frequenting 
open rocky country, breeding in holes in rocks, and laying blue eggs. 
Most of them are fair songsters. 

Two species range throughout South Europe to North China 
during the breeding-season. One species is resident in Abyssinia, 
and three in South Africa. Two species breed in the Himalayas, 
one of which extends also to West China. Ono species breeds in 
South-east Siberia and North-east China, whilst another appears to 
be confined to East China and Japan.

The female has the upper parts an almost uniform brown, 
each feather having an obscure dark shaft-lino and a transverse 
tip • the upper tail-coverts and the tail are chestnut, the former 
with obscure, subtcrminal, transverse bars, and the latter having 
the two centre feathers brown. The underparts, including the lores 
and the ear-coverts, are pale chestnut-brown, shading into pale 
whitish grey on the throat, each feather having a narrow subtcrminal 
dark-brown band ; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and under 
tail-coverts pale chestnut. After the autumn moult the male has 
the feathers of the upper parts with chestnut tips and dark-brown 
subterminal bars, which almost conceal tho white on the back; the 
wing-coverts and quills have conspicuous white tips, and the whole 
of the feathers of the underparts have nearly while margins. After 
the autumn moult the female also has conspicuous pale tips to tho 
feathers of the back and to the wing-coverts and quills. Birth of 
the year much resemble the female; but the ground-colour of tho 
ripper parts of the young male is much bluer, and of tho underparts 
much more chestnut. Young in first plumage resemble birds of the 
year, with the spots somewhat exaggerated. 

The Rock-Thrush breeds in Southern Europe and eastwards 
through Persia, Turkestan, and South Siberia, as far east as Lake 
Baikal, South-east Mongolia, and North China. It passes through 
North Africa on migration, and winters in Senegambia and Abyssinia. 
Eastwards its winter range extends to the borders of India 
and into North Burma.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the genera! colour is dark 
slate-grey suffused with metallic cobalt-blue, most so on the head 
and least so on. the under tail-coverts; lores dark slate-grey; 
wings, wing-coverts, and tail dark brown, the outer web of each 
feather margined with blue; under tail-coverts with white tips 
and obscure subterminal dark bars. Bill black. "Wing with the 
third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 
primary about equal to the fifth, bastard primary 0*95 to 0-9 inch. 
Legs, feet, and claws black. Length of wing 5-05 to 4-4 inches, 
tail 3*3 to 3*1, culmen 1-1 to 0*9, tarsus 1*15 to 1*0. 

After the autumn moult most of the feathers have narrow 
greyish-white margins, those of the tipper parts with obscure brown 
subterminal bars, and those of the underparts with darker brown 
subterminal bars, almost obsolete on the chin and throat. These 
marginal and subterminal bars are cast during March, leaving the 
male in full breeding-plumage. The female somewhat resembles 
the autumn plumage of the male, but is much more brown, being 
far less suffused with blue. The whole of the underparts are pale 
whitish brown, slightly suffused with blue on the breast and belly, 
each feather having a dark-brown subterminal transverse band, 
which on the throat is continued on the margins of the feathers; the 
axillaries and under wing-coverts have several transverse dark bars. 
Birds of the year and young in first plumage differ from the female 
very slightly. 

The Blue Rock-Thrush breeds in Southern Europe, extendiug 

eastwards through Persia, Turkestan, Afghanistan, and South-west 

China. It winters in North Africa as far south as Abyssinia, 

throughout the whole of the peninsula of India, and in Burma 

and South China.

Intermediate forms in every stage, from entirely blue underparts 
with only a few chestnut feathers on the under tail-coverts, 
to nearly thorough-bred examples of the Eastern form, which show 
only a few blue feathers on the chestnut belly, occur in South 
China, Burma, and in Japan, the two subspecies apparently inter-, 
breeding freely in some parts of North-east China.

This species differs from the preceding only in being somewhat 
more suffused with metallic cobalt-blue on the upper parts, and in 
having the axillaries, under wing-coverts, lower breast, belly, flanks, 
and under tail-coverts rich deep chestnut; the thighs are blue, and 
the under tail-coverts have white tips and obscure subterminal dark 
bars as in the allied species. Bill black. Wing with the third 
anil fourth primaries nearly equal aud longest^ second primary 
generally slightly shorter than the fifth, bastard primary 1*15 to 
0-8 inch. Legs, feet, and claws black. Length of wing 5*0 to 4-5 
inches, tail 3*4 to 3*26, culmen 1*0 to 0*9, tarsus 1*2 to 1*1. 

After the autumn moult most of the feathers of the upper parts 
have pale brown margins (palest on the wing-coverts) and obscure 
dark-brown subterminal bars. The blue feathers of the underparts 
are similarly marked, but in the chestnut feathers traces only of 
the subterminal dark bars are observable. These marginal and 
subterminal bars are cast during March, leaving the male in full 
breeding-plumage. The female much resembles the autumn plumage 
of the male, except that the blue of the upper parts is much duller 
and the whole of the underparts are pale whitish brown, suffused with 
pale bufiish brown on the axillaries and under wing- and tail-coverts • 
each feather on the underparts has a dark-brown subterminal transverse 
band, which on the throat is continued on the margins of the 

feathers; the axillaries and the under tail-coverts have several 
transverse dark bars. After the autumn moult the only difference 
perceptible in the female is that the pale brown margins of the 
feathers are somewhat longer. Males of the year scarcely differ from 
adult females, except in having the ground-colour of the underparts 
especially on the breast and belly, tinged with blue. Females of the 
year have the ground-colour of the upper parts brown, only slightly 
tinged with blue on the wing-coverts, rump, and upper tail-coverts 
Young in first plumage differ very slightly from the females of 
the year, but have scarcely a trace of blue. 

The Eastern Blue Eock-Thrush breeds in Japan and in the valley 
of the Ussuri, in North-east China, and in Formosa. It winters in 
South-east China and the islands of the Malay Archipelago.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the forehead, crown, nape, 
chin, upper throat, and cheeks are cobalt-blue ; lores, ear-coverts, 
sides of neck, back, and scapulars black; wings dark brown, the 
basal half of the outside webs of the secondaries white, the 
outside webs of the primaries, primary-coverts, greater and 
median coverts edged with dull blue; lesser wing-coverts cobalt-
blue. Eump, upper tail-coverts, and the whole of the underparts, 
including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, chestnut, except 
the chin and upper throat; inner margin of quills pale brown ; 
tail dark brown, the outside webs of the feathers margined with 
dull blue. Bill nearly black. Wing with the third, fourth, and 
fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal 
to the sixth, bastard primary 1*0 to 0*9 inch. Legs, feet, and 
claws brown. Length of wing 4*12 to 3*9 inches, tail 3*0 to 2-6, 
culmen 0-9 to 0*85, tarsus 1*0 to 0*9. 
In the adidt female in breeding-plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is greyish olive-brown, the rump and upper tail-coverts 
barred with dark brown and brownish white; wings and tail brown, 
the basal half of the outside wobs of the secondaries edged with 
russet-brown : the whole of the underparts greyish white, each 
feather with a subterminal, narrow, dark brown bar; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts pale ochraceous barred with dark brown. 
After the autumn moult each cobalt-blue and black feather of the 
male has a brown margin, which is cast in the spring. The 
autumnal margins of the brown feathers of the female are only very 
slightly paler than the body of the feather. Birds of the year differ 
from adults only in having ochraceous tips to the greater wing-
coverts. Young in first plumage resemble the female on the underparts, 
and have all the small feathers of the upper parts similarly 
marked, the quills and tail-feathers of the young male resembling 
those of the adult male, and those of the young female, especially 

the tail, being russct-brown. Very old females are said to assume 
the male plumage.

The Indian Bock-Thrush breeds throughout the Himalayas, 
migrating to the plains in winter. It has also been recorded from 
the mountain-ranges of Western India, but it seems doubtful at 
what period of the year.

In the adult male in breeding'-plumage the forehead, crown, nape, 
chin, throat, and sides of the neck are dull blue, the feathers of the 
crown with indistinct brown shaft-lines; lores dark brown; ear-
coverts dull blue suffused with brown; back and scapulars russet-
brown, each feather with a dark shaft-line and slightly paler margin; 
wings and wing-coverts brown, the lesser median and greater wing-
coverts and innermost secondaries margined with chestnut. Rump, 
upper tail-coverts, and tail, and the whole of the underparts below 
the throat, including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, chestnut, 
except the terminal three fourths of the two centre tail-
feathers, which are brown. Bill black. Wing with the third, 
fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 
primary about equal to the seventh, bastard primary 1*25 to 1*1 

inch. Legs, feet, and claws dark brown. Length of wing 4-45 to 
4-15 inches, tail 3*3 to 2-85, culmen 1*1 to 1*05, tarsus 1*3 to 1*15. 

The adult female in breeding-plumage resembles the male, except 
in having the forehead, crown, nape, chin, throat, and. sides of the 
neck the same colour as the back. After the autumn moult the blue 
feathers of the head of the male have indistinct pale brown margins,

and the edges of the feathers generally are paler. Birds of ih> year 
have the pale tips to the wing-coverts more pronounced, and" tho 
temale has subterminal dark bars across the feathers of the breast, 
probably remains of first plumage. Young in first plumage appear 
to be unknown. ^ u 

The Brown-backed Bock-Thrush appears to be confined to the

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the forehead is azure-blue, 
shading into bluish slate-grey on the crown, nape, back, and scapulars 
; lores dark brown; quills and primary-coverts brown with 
pale margins; greater and median wing-coverts slate-grey; lesser 
wing-coverts azure-blue. Rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail chestnut, 
except the terminal three fourths of the two central tail-
feathers and a short terminal margin to the outside webs of the 
other tail-feathers, which are dark brown; chin, throat, breast, 
cheeks, and sides of the neck cobalt-blue; the rest of the underpays, 
including the axillaries and under wing-coverts, chestnut. Bill 
black. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary intermediate in length between 
the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 0*95 inch. Legs, feet, and

culmen. 0*95 to 0*93, tarsus 1*35 to 1-3. 

In the adult female in breeding-plumage the general colour of tho 
upper parts is sooty brown ; wings dark brown, paler on the 
margins of the feathers, and becoming slate-grey on the median 
and lesser wing-coverts; rump, upper and under tail-coverts, and

tail coloured as in the male; chin, throat, breast, and flanks huffish 
white mottled with brown ; axillaries, under wing-coverts, and under 
tail-coverts chestnut; centre of belly pale chestnut. After the 
autumn moult the blue-grey feathers of the upper and under parts of 
the male are obscurely edged with brown, and the chestnut feathers 
of the breast have pale edges. The upper parts of the female are a 
darker brown, and the ground-colour of the underparts more chestnut. 
Birds of the year do not apparently differ much from adults. 

Young in first plumage resemble the female on the underparts, and 
have pale tips to the feathers of the upper parts. 

The Long-legged Bock-Thrush appears to be confined to South 
Africa, having been obtained at Cape Town and Kingwillknistown. 
It is not known to be a migratory bird.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the colour is similar to that 
of iff", exploratory but with the forehead and crown bluish white, 
shading into pale slate-grey on the nape; tarsus much shorter. 
Length of wing 4-2 to 3-95 inches, tail 2*61 to 2-56, culmen 1*0 to 
0-9, tarsus 14 to 1-01. 

The adult female in breeding-plumage differs from that of 31. explorator 
in having the upper parts sandy brown rather than sooty 
brown ; the chin, throat, cheeks, and ear-coverts have each feather 
nearly white with a brown margin. After the autumn moult males 
resemble the breeding-plumage of males of M. exploratory and are 
scarcely distinguishable except by the shorter tarsus. Birds of the 
year and young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

The Short-legged Bock-Thrush is found in Damarafend, Griqualand, 
and the Transvaal, where it is supposed to be resident.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the general colour of the 
tipper parts is cobalt-blue, each feather with concealed dark brown 
bases; lores, ear-coverts, and sides of the neck black; wings and 
wing-coverts dark brown, the margins of the outside webs dull blue, 
becoming cobalt-blue on the lesser wing-coverts ; tail brown, suffused 
with dull blue and cobalt-blue; chin and throat black suffused with 
blue; the remainder of the underparts, including the axillaries and 
under wing-coverts,v deep chestnut. Bill black. "Wing with the 
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the seventh and 
eighth, bastard primary 1*5 to 1-2 inch. Legs, feet, and claws 
dark brown. Length of wing 5*0 to 4-6 inches, tail 4*15 to 3*7, 
culmen 1*0 to 0*95, tarsus 1*1 to 1-0. 

In the adult female in breeding-plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts, including the wings and tail, is dull olive-brown, 
transversely barred with black on the rump and upper tail-coveits; 
chin and a narrow line down the centre of the throat nearly uniform 
buff; the remainder of the underparts dark brown, each feather with 
a broad subterminal huffish-white transverse bar; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts pale ochraceous, barred with dark brown. It 
is not known that any change takes place after the autumn moult. 
Birds of the year differ from adults only in the male having pale 
ochraceous tips to the greater wing-coverts, and in the female 
having the barring of the rump extending more or less conspicuously 
over the back, scapulars, and wing-coverts. Young in first plumage

resemble ilio female on the underpays, and have all the small 
feathers o£ the upper parts somewhat similarly marked. 

The Chestnut-bellied Bock-Thrush breeds in the Eastern Himalayas 
from Nepal to Assam, its range extending eastwards as far as 
Sotchucn, in Western China. Nothing is known of its migrations.

wing-coverts are cobalt-blue; lores chestnut-brown; ear-coverts, 
sides of neck, back, and scapulars nearly black; rump and tipper 
tail-coverts chestnut; wings brown, the greater wing-coverts and 
innermost secondaries with pale margins, the base of the outer web 
of several of the secondaries white; tail-feathers brown, suffused 
slightly with bine on the outer webs; a narrowish band down the 
centre of the throat white; the rest of the underparts, including 
the axillaries and under wing-coverts, chestnut. Bill dark brown, 
pale at the base of the under mandible. Wing with the third and 
fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about 
equal to the fifth, bastard primary 0-95 to 0*8 Inch. Legs, feet, and

The female very closely resembles the female of M. dnclorhyrwhct, 
bnt has the whole of the npper parts (except the head, wings, and 
tail) barred. After the autumn moult each cobalt-blue and black 
feather of the male has a pale dull chestnut margin which is cast in 
the spring; the chestnut feathers of the nnderparts have also paler 
margins. Females after the autumn moult, birds of the year, and 
young in first plumage are unknown.

The female differs from the male in having the forehead, eye-
stripe, chin, throat, and breast sooty brown like the back. Birds of 
ilie year and young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

This species is a connecting link between the genera Monticola 
and 8a&icoZa, and is also very closely related to Thamnobia.

The genus Sialia consists of a small group of birds, apparently 

nearly allied to the Kedstarts. The bill is short, slender, and black, 
and the rictal bristles nearly obsolete. The legs are black, and the 
tarsus unscutellated. The tail consists of twelve feathers, and is 
long and slightly forked. The wings are very long and pointed; the 
bastard primary is very small, and the second primary as long, or 
nearly so, as the third. The prevailing colours are blue, occasionally 
mixed with chestnut.

In habits the Bluebirds resemble to some extent the Redstarts, 
perching freely in trees, breeding in holes in trees, and laying blue eggs. 

One species is peculiar to the Himalayan Kegion, whilst five are 
found on the American continent, three in the Nearctic Region,, and 
two in the Neotropical.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the general colour of both 
upper and under parts is deep indigo-blue, shading into brilliant 
indigo-blue, with metallic gloss on the rump and upper tail-coverts ; 
lores black; wing-coverts, quills, and tail-feathers black, obscurely 
margined on the outside web with greenish blue; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts dull black, margined with indigo-blue; inner 
margin of quills dull black. Bill black ; rictal bristles nearly obsolete. 
Wings with the second and third primaries nearly equal and 
longest; bastard primary 0-65 to 0-4 inch. Legs, feet, and claws 
black. Length of wing 5*7 to 5-6 inches (females 5*4 to 5-2) tail 
3*55 to 345, oilmen 0*8 to 0*7, tarsus 1*15.

The female is an almost uniform earthy brown above and below, 
the feathers of the rump and upper tail-coverts alone being broadly 
tipped with dull brownish blue; the feathers of the head, nape, 
upper back, cheeks, chin, throat, breast, and flanks have groyish-whitc 
shaft-lines and tips, and the axillaries, under wing-coverts, and under 
tail-coverts have broad transverse greyish-white terminal bands ; the 
secondaries and the adjoining five primaries have a broad white subbasal 
band or bar ; inner margin of quills greyish white in the 
centre, shading into greyish brown towards the base and tip. After 
the autumn moult the blue is slightly obscured by duller margins of 
the feathers. Birds of the year and young in first 'plumage appear 
to be unknown in collections, but are described as somewhat resembling 
the females in their plumage. Some writers consider the so-

called females to be young birds, and suppose that the adult female 
resembles the male.

In the adult male hi breeding-plum age the general colour of the 
upper parts is brilliant metallic cobalt-blue; lores, ear-coverts and 
cheeks dull brownish blue; wings, wing-coverts, and tail brilliant 
metallic cobalt-blue, broadly margined with brown on the inner 
webs. Chin, throat, breast, and flanks chestnut-brown with concealed 
blue bases, shading into white on the belly and under tail-
coverts, the longest of the latter suffused with blue ; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts pale bluish grey with white margins; inner 
margin of quills pale grey. Bill black. Wings with the second, 
third, and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, bastard primary 
0*7 to 0*45 inch. Legs, feet, and claws black. Length of win^ 
4*1 to 3*75 inches, tail 2'65 to 2*44, culmen 0*7 to 0-56, tarsus 0*85 

to 0*8. 
The female differs from the male in having the cobalt-blue 
without metallic gloss, much duller, and confined to the win^s 
upper tail-coverts, and tail, the rest of the upper parts, including 
the lores and the ear-coverts, being bluish grey suffused with brown* 
the underparts are much lighter and duller in colour, especially 
on the chin and upper throat, and the under tail-coverts, axillaries 
and under wing-coverts are nearly white. After the autumn moult 
each feather on the upper parts of the male is obscurely tipped with 
brown, and the quill- and tail-feathers have narrow pale margins 
towards the tips, which are most conspicuous on the innermost 
secondaries. The feathers of the underparts look duller in consequence 
of becoming paler towards the tips. In the female the 
change is scarcely observable, except in the wings and tail, which 
resemble those of the male. The male of the year differs from the 
adult in having the outer web of the innermost secondaries broadly 
margined with chestnut-brown, and the chestnut-brown of the 
underparts is more chocolate. The young in first plumage resemble 
the hirds of the year in the wings and tail, but have the whole of 
the small feathers of the upper parts a dull grey, those of the 
upper back and scapulars having pale shaft-lines, the wing-coverts 
having conspicuous white tips, and the feathers of the lower back 
having obscure dark transverse bars. The feathers of the throat, 
breast, and flanks have nearly white centres and brown margins. 
The Eastern Bluebird breeds in the United States of America 
east of the Eocky Mountains, and in the same longitude in South 
Canada, migrating to the Southern States and Cuba during the 
severest part of winter. It is a resident bird in the Bermudas.

This form does not appear to differ materially in colour from the 
preceding, and rests its claim to be considered a species solely 
upon the fact that it is a somewhat larger bird with a tail proportionately 
longer. The length of wing yaries from 4*4 to 4*0 inches, 
and that of the tail from 2-05 to 2-75. In all other respects, and 
in the differences which are attributable to sex, age, and season, it 
does not appear to differ from the preceding. An examination of a 
larger series of these birds may prove that the difference between 
this and the preceding form is only subspecific.

In the adult male in breeding-plum age the general colour of the 
upper parts is brilliant metallic indigo-blue; lores, ear-coverts, 
cheeks, chin, and upper throat dull blue, more or less suffused with 
brown'; the feathers of the upper back vary in individuals from 
chestnut-brown to blue, obscurely tipped with chestnut-brown; 
greater wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, and the tips of the remaining 
secondaries, the primaries, the primary-coverts, and the 
tail brown, the remaining portions of the wing and tail brilliant 
metallic indigo-blue; lower throat, breast, and flanks chestnut-
brown, shading into grey, more or less suffused with blue on the 
belly; under tail-coverts, axillaries, and under wing-coverts pale

This form differs from the preceding in having the indigo-blue of 
the upper parts replaced by brilliant metallic cobalt-bine, and in 
having the brown on the upper parts much more developed, in some 
examples the upper back and scapulars showing little or no traces 
of blue. Tn other respects the two forms do not differ in colour, 
but this form appears to be always smaller in size. Length of wing 
4-2 to 4-05 inches (females 3*48 to 3-35), tail 2-6 to 2-35, culmen 
0-63 to 0-56, tarsus 0*88 to 0*8, bastard primary 0*65 to 0-5. 

The female differs from that of the preceding in having the blue 
of the wings, rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail of the same cobalt-
blue as the male, and in having the back much more suffused with 
brown. The changes which take place after the autumnal moult 
are the same as in the preceding form. Birds of the year appear 
to be unknown, but young in first plumage are scarcely distinguishable 
from those of 8. sialis.

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is brilliant metallic azure-blue, greenish on the back, 
and with violet reflections on tho wings and two centre tail-feathers ; 
greater wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, and the tips of the 
remaining secondaries and primaries and of the tail-feathers 
brown; lores, ear-coverts, cheeks, chin, throat, breast, flanks, axillaris, 
and under wing-coverts dull verdigris-blue, shading into 
nearly white on the centre of the belly and under tail-coverts, the 
longest feathers of the latter being slightly suffused with blue; 
inner margin of quills pale bluish grey. Bill black. Wings with

The female has the wings, rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail of 
the same colour as the male, but paler ; the rest of the upper parts 
are greyish brown, very obscurely tipped with pale metallic verdigris-
brown. The underparts are pale greyish brown, shading into 
nearly white on the centre of the belly, under tail-coverts, and 
under wing-coverts, and slightly suffused with verdigris-blue on the 
axillaries only. After tlie autumn moult the feathers of the upper 
parts have very obscure brown fringes, and the outer webs of the

The genus ButiciTla comprises a group of thirteen species very 
nearly allied to the Eobins. The bill is always short, slender, and 
black, and the rictal bristles fairly developed ; the legs are always 
black, or nearly so, and the tarsus unscutellated ; the tail consists 
of twelve feathers, and is long and nearly even. Most of the species 
have the rump and the tail-feathers, except the two centre ones, 
chestnut. One species has the pattern of the tail Saxicoline, but it 
may at once be distinguished from the chestnut-tailed Chats by the tail 
being about five times the length of the culmen. In two other species 
there is little or no chestnut on the tail; but they may be distinguished 
from the black or brown-tailed Robins by the black on the 
throat, and the white on the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries. 
All the male adult Redstarts, except one species, have black or very 
dark-blue throats. The Redstarts are fair songsters, perch freely 
in trees, but generally build in holes of walls, rocks, and tree-trunks. 
Two species" breed throughout temperate Europe, one of which 
just enters Persia, and the other penetrates as far east as Central 
Siberia. On the eastern shores of the Mediterranean three other 
species appear, two of which probably only just enter Persia, 
whilst the third enters Turkestan. In the Caucasus a sixth species 
begins, and continues eastwards through Turkestan and the Himalayas, 
to the borders of China. Two more species appear in 
Turkestan, one of which extends eastwards to the Himalayas, and 
the other to South-east Siberia. Eour additional species appear in 
the Himalayas, extending eastwards to West China; whilst the last 
species is first met with near Lake Baical, and extends to Japan and 
North China. The genus may be said to be pretty evenly distributed 
throughout the temperate Palasarctic Region and the highlands 
of the Himalayas, the number of species being greatest in the latter 
district.

In the male in full autumn plumage the general colour of the 
upper parts is "brown, the concealed white bases of the feathers on 
the forehead showing conspicuously when disturbed, and slate-grey 
making itself-seen on the back under similar circumstances ; rump 
and upper tail-coverts rich chestnut; wings and wing-coverts dark 
brown, with pale chestnut-brown margins on the outer webs of each 
feather, broadest on the innermost secondaries; tail chestnut, except 
the inner webs of the two central tail-feathers, which are dark 
brown. A narrow band at the base of the upper mandible, the 
lores, cheeks, ear-coverts, chin, and throat are black, each feather 
narrowly margined with pale brownish chestnut; the breast and 
flanks are chestnut, each feather broadly margined with white, 
shading into nearly pure white on the centre of the belly, and into 
pale chestnut on the axillaries, under wing- and tail-coverts; inner 
margin of quills pale brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. 
Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and 
longest; second primary about equal to the sixth, frequently 
slightly shorter, and occasionally slightly longer* bastard primary 
0*9 to 0*75 inch. Length of wing 3-3 to 2-8 inches, tail 2-5 to 2-1, 
culmen 0-58 to 0*5, tarsus 0*9 to 0*75. 
The female resembles the male in the colour of the upper parts, 
except that there are no black, white, or slate-grey bases to the 
feathers to become visible when the plumage is ruffled. The underpays 
are buff, darkest on the breast, axillaries, and under tail-
coverts. In breeding-plumage the forehead of the male has become 
pure white, all trace of brown has disappeared from the head and 
back, leaving them slate-grey, and the pale margins of the wing-
coverts, quills, and innermost secondaries are scarcely perceptible; 
the narrow band at the base of the upper mandible, the lores, cheeks, 
ear-coverts, 
and throat have become a velvet-black, and the feathers

of the breast and flanks have east their white margins, and have, in 
company with the axillaries, wing-coverts, and under tail-coverts, 
deepened in colour to a rich chestnut. The female has little or no 
seasonal change. Birds of the year differ from adults only in having 
the Hack parts broadly, instead of narrowly, margined with pale 
brownish chestnut. Young in first plumage resemble the female, 
but have each feather of the upper and under parts, except the 
quills and tail-feathers, with pale centres and dark margins. 

The European Ecdstart breeds throughout the Palaearctic Eegion 
as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far east as the watershed 
of the Yenesay and the Lena, in the southern districts, at some 
elevation, preferring the pine-region. It winters in South Persia 

and Central Africa as far west as Senegal.

This species is very closely allied to B. plioenicura. The male 
differs from the Western bird in having the outside webs of the 
secondaries more or less broadly margined -with white. The female 
resembles that of the nearly allied species, but is slightly darker on 
both the upper and under parts, and is intermediate between it and 
the female of JR. titliys. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth 
primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to 
the sixth, bastard primary 0*86 to 0*6 inch. Length of wing 3'2 to 
2-84 inches, tail 2*45 to 2*16, culmen 0-54 to 0-5, tarsus 0-9 
to 0*75. 

The seasonal changes resemble those of the preceding plumage. 
Yovng in first plumage are somewhat darker in the colour both of 
the upper and under parts than is the case in the nearly allied 
species.

In the adult male in full autumn plumage tlie general colour of 
the upper parts is slate-grey; a narrow line at the base of the 
upper mandible, the lores, and chin are black; qnills brown, the 
outside webs of the secondaries narrowly margined with, white; 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries slate-grey; rump, upper 
and under tail-coverts, and tail bright chestnut, except the two 
centre tail-feathers, which are brown; throat, breast, axillaries, 
and under wing-coverts black, each feather more or less obscurely 
margined with buffish brown, which is the colour of the belly and

flanks; inner margin of quills pale brown. Ml, legs, feet, and 
claws black. TVings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to the seventh, 
bastard primary 0-9 to 0-8 inch. Length of wing 3*5 lo 3*3 inches 
(females 3*3 to 3-2). tail 2-65 to 2-45, oilmen 0-57 to 0-54, tarsus 
1-0 to 0-9. 

In the female in full autumn plumage the upper and under tail-
coverts and the tail are similar in colour to those of the male; the 
rest of the plumage is sooty brown, paler on the margins of the outside 
webs of the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries, and on the 
centre of the belly. In the male in spring the bufhbh-brown 
margins to the feathers on the throat, breast, axillarics, and under 
wing-coverts are cast, leaving them black; the black band at the 
base of the upper mandible has become broader, the head and lower 
back has become a darker slate-grey, and the upper back, scapulars, 
and wing-coverts nearly black; the white on the wing has also become 
less conspicuous. The female has become slightly darker, and 
the pale edges to the wing-feathers have nearly disappeared. It is 
not known that birds of the year differ from adults. Young in first 
'plumage ha^e most of the feathers of the upper and under parts 
barred at the tips with black. 

The Black ltedstart breeds in Central and Southern Europe, its 
range extending eastwards as far as West Persia. It is a rare 
visitor to the British Islands and South Norway and Sweden, and 
is recorded as having strayed as far north as Iceland. In South 
Europe it is a partial resident, and has been said to breed in Algeria. 
It winters in Nubia.

rios and under wing-coverts, and the Mack breast and upper belly 
of the former, and the chestnut lower belly of the latter. The forehead 
is black and the crown pale grey, shading into black on the 
nape. Length of wing 3*3 inches, tail 2*5, culinen 0*55, tarsus 0*88. 

The female is not distinguishable from that of M. rufivtntris. 

Nothing is apparently known of this species beyond the types in 
the Museum from Asia Minor. I suvpect that the female is a specimen 
of JR. rufiventris, and the male a hybrid between that bird 

and E. titliys.

This species is distinct from, though very nearly allied to, R.<phce~ 
nicura. In its spring plumage it differs in having the black at 
the base of the upper mandible slightly more developed, and the 
white on the forehead rather less conspicuous; the colour of the 
mantle and the wing-coverts is much darker, approaching black • 

9. RTTIIC3XLA.

the black on the throat extends over the tipper breast, and the rent 
of the underparts are a uniform chestnut, richer in colour than in 
the Western species, and not becoming paler on the centre of the 
belly and under tail-coverts. In other respects there appears to be 
little or no difference in the colour of the two species. Wings with 
the third,^ fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary about equal to the sixth, bastard primary 1/0 to 
0-75 inch. Length of wing 3*6 to 3-2 inches (females 3*30 to 3*31), 
tail 2-6 to 2-4, oilmen 0-61 to 0-54, tarsus 1-0 to 0-9. 

The female is considerably darker, both on the upper and under 
parts, than that of its near ally, and the under tail-coverts are more 
rufous. In full autumn plumage the difference between the two 
species is less striking, as in both of them the white and black 
feathers are tipped with brown. 

This species is subject to considerable variations. Extreme forms 
have the entire head, neck, breast, back, scapulars, and wing-coverts 
jet-black. The black on the upper breast also sometimes extends 
so far down as to cover the entire breast; but it is never so much 
developed as in M, erythroprocta, and the axillaries are never black 
as in that species. 

Males of the year have the upper parts coloured as in the female, 
and the black on the throat partially concealed by the brown tips 
to the feathers. Females of the year have broad pale edges to the 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries, and have the underparts 
much browner. Young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

The Indian Redstart breeds in North China, Mongolia, and 
Eastern Turkestan, wintering in India, Scinde, Baluchistan, and 
South-east Persia.

This species differs from the preceding, not only in being on an 
average slightly smaller, but also in having a considerable quantity 
of black on the under wing-coverts. It is scarcely more than a 
local race, as many examples of the Eastern form also show some 
black on the under wing-coverts. Length of wing—males 3*1 to 
2-9 inches, females 3-06 to 2-62; tail 2-2 to 1-8, oilmen 0*6 to 0*52,

a narrow line at the base of the upper mandible, the lores, feathers 
behind the eye, ear-coverts, cheeks, chin, and throat black; quills 
and primary-coverts brown; a white patch on the wing, formed by 
the basal half of the outer webs of the innermost and two or three 
adjoining secondaries being white; greater, median, and lesser 
wing-coverts dark brown, the outside webs margined with slate-
grey; tail bright chestnut, the two central feathers more or less 
brown ; axillaries, under wing-coverts, breast, belly, flanks, and 
under tail-coverts bright chestnut. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. 
"Wings with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary equal in length to the eighth or ninth, bastard 
primary 1*0 to 0*91 inch. Length of wing 3«29 to 3*05, tail 2-85 
to 2-6, culmen 0-6 to 0-56, tarsus 1-0 to 0-9. 

In the adult female in full autumn plumage the general colour of 
the upper and under parts, including the wings, is greyish brown, 
paler on the chin, axillaries, and under wing-coverts, shading into 
nearly white on the centre of the belly, and into very pale chestnut 
on the under tail-coverts, and into rich chestnut on the upper tail-
coverts. In spring little change takes place, except that the white 
on the forehead of the male becomes of somewhat larger extent. It 
is not known that birds of the year differ from adults. Young in 
first plumage appear to be unknown. 

Hodgson's Redstart breeds in the mountains of Western China, 
and winters in the valleys of the Himalayas from Nepal to Assam.

In the adult male in full autumn plumage the head and nape are 
slate-grey, the tips of the feathers being brown, half concealing pale 
blue centres, slightly paler behind the eye; a narrow line at the 
base of the upper mandible, the chin, throat, cheeks, ear-coverts, 
lores, sides of the neck, back, scapulars, and wing-coverts are black, 
the feathers occasionally fringed here and there with brown ; quills 
dark brown, approaching black on the innermost secondaries, the 
latter tipped with brown; the basal half of the secondaries is 
white, forming a white patch on the wing; rump and upper tail-
coverts bright chestnut; tail bright chestnut, except the two centre 
feathers and the terminal half of the outer web of the outside 
feather on each side, which are dark brown> occasionally mixed with 
bright chestnut; breast, axillaries, under wing-coverts, belly, flanks, 
and under tail-coverts bright chestnut; inner margin of quills pale 
brown, except that of the basal half of secondaries, which is white. 
Bill black; legs, feet, and claws dark brown. "Wings with the 
fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
equal to the eighth or ninth, bastard primary 0-92 to 0*8 inch. 


Length of wing 2-95 to 2*8 inches, tail 2'b to 2-4, culmen 0*6 to 
0-52, tarsus 0-92 to 0-87. 


In the adult female in full autumn plumage the general colour is 
sooty brown, paler on the underparts, especially on the centre of the*, 
belly, the rump, tail, and upper and under tail-coverts alone being 
of the same colour as those of the male, but not quite so bright; the 
quills and wing-coverts are brown, and the white patch on the wing 
ib less extensive. In the spring the black parts %of the male become 
deeper black by the disappearance of the few brown edgings to the 
feathers observable after the autumn moult; otherwise little change 
tikes place. It is not known that birds of tlte year differ from 
adults. Young in first plum age have pale centres and dark terminal 
bands to most of the small feathers of both the upper and under 
parts. 

The Daurian Redstart breeds in the forests of South-east Siberia, 
East Mongolia, North China, and the mountains of Japan. It 
winters in the plains of Japan, Formosa, Hainan, and South China, 
a few wandering as far as Assam, the Malay peninsula, Java, and 
Timor.

In the adidt male in full autumn plumage the forehead, crown, 
and nape are pale grey, any disturbance of the feathers showing 
their white centres; a narrow line at the base of the upper 
mandible, the lores, ear-coverts, sides of the neck, cheeks, chin, 
throat, breast, upper and under wing-coverts, back, and scapulars 
are black; quills dark brown, with a white spot on the wing caused 
by the base of the primaries, the basal two thirds of the secondaries 
on both webs, and the basal half of the outer web of the largest 
innermost secondary being white; rump, upper tail-coverts, tail, 
axillarics, belly, flanks, and under tail-coverts chestnut, slightly

TUEDIDiE. 

darker on the two centre tail-feathers. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
black. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal 
and longest; second primary about equal to the seventh; bastard 
primary 1-2 inch. Length of wing 4'3 to 4*05 inches, tail 3*3 to 
3-01, culmen 0-6 to 0-59, tarsus 1-1. 

In the adult female in full autumn plumage the general colour of 
the upper parts, including the quills, is drab, slightly darker on the 
lores and ear-coverts, and nearly white on the margins of the greater 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries; the rump, upper tail-
coverts, and tail are a somewhat duller chestnut than in the male. 
The underparts are drab, slightly paler on the chin, axillaries, 
under wing-coverts, inner margin of quills, and centre of belly, and 
suffused with pale chestnut on the under tail-eoveits. The only 
changes of importance which take place in spring are that in the 
male the grey margins to the feathers of the head are partially cast, 
leaving the white centres more conspicuous, and in the female the 
pale edges to the greater wing-coverts and innermost secondaries 
become more or less abraded. Birds of the year do not differ from 
adults. Young in first plumage have very obscure pale centres to 
the feathers of the upper and under parts; the male resembles the 
female, except in having the wings of the adult male, with the addition 
of buff tips to the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries. 

Guldenstadt's Eedstart breeds in the birch- and pine-regions of 
the Caucasus, Turkestan, the Himalayas, and the mountain-ranges 
between Thibet and China. It has also occurred near Lake Baical. 
In winter it descends into the valleys.

blue centres; a narrow lino at the base of the upper mandible, the 
lores, ear-coverts, and sides of the nock are black, each feather more 
or less indistinctly tipped with brown ; the back, rump, and upper 
tail-coverts are bright chestnut, each feather of the back fringed 
with brown• the scapulars are black, similarly fringed; quills 
brown, the innermost secondaries dark brown, the outside webs 
narrowly margined with white; primary-coverts white, broadly 
tipped with dark brown; greater wing-coverts dark brown, narrowly 
tipped with white ; median wing-coverts white * leaser wing-coverts 
brown; tail bright chestnut, except the two centre feathers and the 
terminal half of the outer web of the outside feather on each side, 
which arc dark brown, occasionally mixed with bright chestnut. 
Chin, throat, breast, and flanks bright chestnut, each feather more 
or less obscurely tipped with pale bullish brown, which is the colour 
of the belly ; under tail-coverts with a more distinct shade of 
chestnut; axillaries and under wing-coverts white; inner margin of 
quills huffish brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Wing with 
the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 
primary intermediate in length between the seventh and eighth, 
bastard primary 1-1 to 1*0 inch. Length of wing 3-5 to 3*4 inches, 

tail 2*85 to 2*75, culmen 0*6 to 0*46, tarsus 1*0 to 0*9. 

In the female the wings, rump, tail, and upper and under tail-

coverts are coloured as in the male. The rest of the plumage is an 

almost uniform greyish brown, paler on the chin and centre of belly. 

In spring the brown edges to the feathers are most of them cast, 

leaving the head and nape groyish white, mottled with brown, and 

the back, throat, and breast rich chestnut, only streaked here and 

there with pale brown. Birds of the year and young in Jirst 

plumage appear to be unknown. 

Eversrnann's Redstart breeds in the pine- and birch-districts of 

Turkestan, South-western Mongolia, and South-eastern Siberia. In 

winter it descends into the valleys, and has been obtained in the 

North-western Himalayas, South Persia, and Eastern Asia Minor.

Adidt male in full autumn plumage. Eorehead and supercilium 

cobalt-blue, shading on the crown into blue-black, which extends 

over the whole head and neck including the mantle and scapulars ; 

the blue-black feathers are tipped with chestnut, causing these 

parts to appear to bs dusted over with brown; the primaries 

and secondaries are brown, with narrow pale margins to the outride 

edges ; the innermost secondaries are dark brown, broadly margined 

on the outside edges with chestnut; the lesser wing-coverts are 

dark blue, with narrow pale edges; the median and greater wing-

coverts are black with broader chestnut edges, and the primary 

coverts are dark brown with obscure palo edges; the lower back, 

rump, and upper tail-coverts are rich chestnut; the two centre tail-

feathers are "black, margined with chestnut on the outer edge towards 

the base ; the rest of the tail-feathers are rich chestnut, with the 

terminal half of the outside web of each outside feather and the tips 

of all the feathers for about half an inch black. Sides of the neck, 

ear-coverts, cheeks, chin, throat, and fore neck blue-black, dusted 

over with brown• the rest of the underparts rich, chestnut, somewhat 

paler in the centre of the belly• axillaries chestnut, with concealed 

dusky bases; thighs sooty brown. BUI, legs, and claws black. 

"Wing considerably rounded and concave; fourth and fifth primaries 

nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal to the eighth; 

bastard primary 1*1 to 0*9 inch, rather broad, not quite half the length 

of the second primary. Length of wing 3*6 to 3*4 inches (females 

3*5 to 3*2), tail 2*9 to 2*7, culmen 0*61 to 0*54, tarsus 1*0 to 0*92. 

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the chestnut tips of the 
feathers which are blue-black have become entirely abraded, causing 
the dusted appearance of these parts to disappear. The chestnut 
and pale edges to the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries have 
also almost all been abraded. 

Adult female in full autumn plumage. General colour of the 
upper parts rich sooty brown, with a shade of chestnut on the 
forehead and shading into rich chestnut on the rump and upper tail-
coverts * quills brown, with obscure, narrow, pale margins on the 
outside edges ; innermost secondaries and wing-eoverts dark brown, 
with broader brownish-white margins on the outside edges; two centre 
tail-feathers dark brown, with chestnut margins on the basal half of 
the outside edges; the rest of the tail-feathers rich chestnut, three-
fourths of the terminal portion of the outside edge of the outside 
feather on each side and the apex of each of the remaining feathers

for about half an inch being brown. The underpaid are palor sooty 
brown, shading into pale chestnut on the chin and the centre of the 
belly; axillaries and under wing-coverts pale chestnut, with concealed 
dusky bases; under tail-coverts rich chestnut. 

In breeding-plumage the pale edges to the wing-coverts and 
innermost secondaries have disappeared by abrasion, and the pale 
chestnut of ^the chin and centre of the belly has faded into pale 
brown. It is not known that birds of the year differ from adults. 
Young in first plumage resemble the adult female, but have pale 
centres and dark margins to the feathers of both the upper and 
under parts. 

The Blue-fronted Eedstart breeds in the pine-forests of the 
mountain-chains which form the western, southern, and eastern 
boundaries of Thibet, Cashmere, Nepal, Sikkim, Assam, Moupin, 
and Kansu, descending into the valleys during the cold season.

Adult male in full autumn plumage* Forehead and crown (with, 
the exception of a narrow black band at the base of the bill) cobalt-
blue, the black bases of the feathers becoming conspicuous on the 
occiput, nape, and hind neck; mantle and lower back black; the 
feathers of the rump and upper tail-coverts deep rich chestnut with, 
concealed black bases; scapulars black, with the terminal half of the 
inside web deep rich chestnut; lesser wing-coverts black; median

primaries and secondaries dark brown • innermost secondaries nearly 

black, with a broad white margin on the onter edge• tail-feathers 

black, with concealed chestnut bases, except the two central feathers, 

which are black throughout. Sides of the neck, ear-coverts, cheeks, 

chin, throat, and fore neck black, with the exception of a large, 

irregular, round, white spot in the centre of the lower throat and 

fore neck* the rest of the underparts deep rich chestnut, the 

feathers of the centre of the belly tipped with white; axillaries and 

under wing-coverts black with white tips; thighs black. Bill, legs, 

and claws black. Wing considerably rounded and concave; fourth and 

fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate 

in length between the ninth and tenth; bastard primary 1*05 to 0*95 

inch, rather broad, not quite half the length of the second primary. 

Length of wing 3*2 to 3*1 inches, tail 2*8 to 2*7, culmen 0*6 to 0*56, 

tarsus 0*95 to 0*9. 

In the adult male in breeding-plumage the cobalt-blue on the 

crown has nearly disappeared by abrasion, but remains conspicuous 

on the forehead and supercilium. The dark brown of the wings has 

faded into brown, and the chestnut of both the upper and under 

parts is less deep and rich. 

Adult female in full autumn plumage. General colour of the 
upper parts rich sooty brown, with a slight tinge of pale cobalt on 
the forehead, and of chestnut on the tips of the scapulars; the 
feathers of the rump and upper tail-coverts deep rich chestnut, with 
concealed dark bases; lesser wing-coverts dark brown, with obscure 
pale edges • median wing-coverts white ; greater wing-eoverts dark 
brown, with obscure pale chestnut edges; primary wing-coverts 
brown; quills brown, with an obscure narrow chestnut-brown 
margin to the outer edges • innermost secondaries dark brown, with 
narrow white margins to the outer edges, tinged with rufous towards 
the tips; tail dark brown, the basal half more or less tinged with 
chestnut, except the two central feathers, which are dark brown 
throughout. The general colour of the underparts is a somewlat 
duller sooty brown, with an irregular white spot, somewhat smaller 
than that of the male, in the centre of the lower throat and fore neck. 
The centre of the belly shows more white than in the male, and a 
trace of chestnut is observable • the under tail-coverts are pale 
chestnut; axillaries and under wing-coverts black with white tips; 
thighs dark brown. 

I have been unable to meet with skins of females hi breeding-
plumage or of young in first plumage. Immature birds are said to 

want the white spot on the throat, or to have it imperfectly deve


loped, and in this plumage have been described as 22. nigrogidaris. 

The "White-throated Bedstart breeds in the wooded valleys of 
Kansu, and winters in Nepal and Sikkim. It probably breeds also 
in the pine-regions of the latter countries.

In the adult male in full autumn plumage the head and nape are 
greyish brown, with concealed light blue centres to each leather ; a 
narrow line at the ba.se of the upper mandible, the lores, the feathers 
round and behind the eye, the chin, and the ear-coverts are black. 
The throat, breast, under wing-coverts, back, and scapulars are black, 
each feather obscurely margined with brown. Etimp, upper tail-coverts, 

•and tail black. Wings and wing- coverts black, except the median wing-
coverts and the outside margin of the innermost secondaries, which are 
white; axillaries, belly, and under tail-coverts white; inner margin of 
quills brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Wings with the fourth 
and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary about 
equal to the ninth, bastard primary 0-9 inch. Length of wing 3*2 to 
2*95 inches, tail 2*71 to 2*3, culmen 0*55 to 0-5, tarsus 0-9 to 0-88. 
In the adult female in full breeding-plumage the general colour 
of both the upper and the under parts is greyish brown, slightly 
darker on the wings and tail, and paler on the centre of the belly, 
under tail-coverts, and axillarie«; the upper tail-coveits are dull 
chestnut; the greater and median wing-coverts have white tips 
suffused with chestnut, and the innermost secondaries have pale 
margins. In spring the male has cast the tips of his feathers, the 
head and nape being in consequence pale blue, and the black parts 
without any brown margins to the feathers. Little change appears 
to take place in the plumage of the female. It is not known that 
hirds of the year differ from adults, except in having the tipper tail-
coverts dull chestnut in both sexes. Young in first phimage have 
pale centres and black margins to most of the feathers of the upper 
and underparts; the wing-coverts are spotted as in the adult female, 
the outer webs of the innermost secondaries are broadly margined 
with white, and the upper tail-coverts are dull chestnut. 

The Blue-headed Eedstart breeds in the pine- and birch-districts 
of North-eastern Turkestan, Afghanistan, and the range of the Himalayas, 
descending into the valleys in winter.

Tail of Myrmecocichla pollux. 

The genus Myrmecocichla comprises a small group of birds which 
connect the Chats with the Eobins. From the former they may 
always be known by the pattern of the tail, which is either wanting 
altogether, or present in only a rudimentary form. Where there is 
any white at the base or outside webs of any of the tail-feathers, 
the species may at once be distinguished by the emargiuated tip of 
the second primary. It is not so easy to give characters which shall 
always separate them from the Kobins. Their black or dark-brown 
legs will separate them from the plain-coloured Eobins; and the 
absence of brilliant colours, such as crimson or rich chestnut, and of 
violent contrasts in the colours of the cheeks and throat, will separate 
them from the darker-legged llobins. The bill is black and Haxicoline 
in shape; and the rictal bristles are small. The tail consists of 
twelve feathers and is slightly rounded. 

In their habits these birds are more Chats than Eobins, frequenting 
rocks and open ground.

black, the feathers of the latter with brown margins; scapulars, 
rump, and upper tail-coverts white, more or less suffused with buff; 
wings and tail black. Lores, chin, throat, cheeks, ear- coverts, and 
sides of the neck black ; axillaries and under wing-coverts black ;

The female is huffish brown on the upper parts, shading into dark 
buff on the rump and upper tail-coverts, with an obscure buff eye-
stripe and obscure dark centres to the feathers of the head and back; 
wing-coverts and innermost secondaries dark brown, with buffi shbrown

shaft-lines lo most of the feathers. AfUr the autumn moult the 
feathers of the back, axillaries, and under wing-coverts of the male 
have white tips, and the innermost secondaries have white margins. 
No important change takes place in the plumage of the female. 
Hales of the year have all the white parts entirely suffused with 
buff, and the crown and back coloured as in the female. Young in 
tint plumage have pale huff centres and dark brown margins to the 
feathers of the crown, back, and breast; otherwise they resemble the 
female in autumn plumage. 

The Black-throated Chat-Robin has been found in the Transvaal, 
the Orange Free State, Natal, and the North-east of Caj3e Colony.

11. SAXICOLA. x. 
Tail of Sarieola mmtntk*. 

The genus Saxicola contains thirty or more species of bird*, none 
of them much larger or smaller than a Robin. The hill i* slender 
and black, and only moderately furnished with rietol bristle*. The 
legs are also black, and the tarsus unseutellated. In every species 
the bastard primary is small, and the wings comparatively flat and 
pointed. The tail consists of twelve feathers of nearly equal length. 
The most important character, however, is to be found ill the colour 
of the rump, upper tail-coverts, and the base of the tail, which 
in typical species is white. One species (8. jtanthoprymna) is 
aberrant in the colour of the rump and upper tail-coverts, but is 
typical in the colour of the tail, whilst three specie* {8. masta, 

8. chnjmpitfjia. and & rjaltom) are Kuticilltne in the colour of the 
rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail. These species may, however, 
be distinguished from the genus Rutirilla by the proportion between 
the culmen and tail. In HuiiciUa the tall is more than 
four times the length of the culmen, whilst in Saxieola it is leas. 
The Chats are essentially ground-birds, seldom if ever perching

some cultivated plains, and others arid deserts. 

The genus 8a<vicola is principally ^Ethiopian. Six species arc 
peculiar to South Africa; five more to Nubia and Abyssinia. Five 
species inhabit North Africa, of which the range of three extends 
to Palestine, and the remaining two to Turkestan. Eight species 
are European, of which the range of three extends to Persia, one 
extends to Turkestan, and two to China. Pour species breed only 
in Persia, and four only in Turkestan.

is a bullish brown on the breast, shading into pale grey on 
the belly and throat, and into dull buff on the undor tail-coverts,

Adult male in breeding-plumage. Entire head, neck, upper back, 
throat, axillaries, and under wing-coverts black ; quills dark brown, 
slightly paler on the under surface; lower back, ramp, upper tail-
coverts, breast, belly, and under tail-coverts white ; tail-feathers 
white, except the terminal half of the two central feathers and the 
teiminal half inch of the others, v>hich are dark brown. Bill, legs, 
feet, and claws black. "Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary about equal in 
length to the sixth, bastard primary 1*05 to 0-85 inch. Length of 
w ing 4*2 to 3*9 inches (female 3*05 to 3*75), tail 3*0 to 2*05, culmen 
0-87 to 0*75, tarsus 1-13 to 1*0. 

It is not known that the plumage of the female differs in any 
respect from that of the male. No change takes place after the 
autumn moult beyond the greater brilliancy of the colours. Young 
in first plumage and birds of the ytar are said to have the black 
more sooty in tinge, and to bo spotted only at the tips of the wing-
coverts and quills. 

So far as is known, Hume's Chat is confined to South-eastern 
Persia, Baluchistan, and Bcincle, where it appears to be a rebident,

Between these two forms every intermediate variety occurs. The 
extreme forms only differ in the colour of the crown of the head and 
nape: in the former it is jet-black, in the latter nearly pure white, 
Hume is of opinion that the white-headed bird is the fully adult 
bird of the black-headed species. In this opinion Dr. Scully, who, 
during his residence in Gilgit, obtained a magnificent series of intermediate 
forms, concurs. Blanford, who also obtained a tine series 
oi intermediate forms in Scinde and llajputana, is of opinion that 
the two forms are distinct species, and that the intermediate forms 
an* the immature white-headed birds. The question must, in my 
opinion, remain an open one until further facts are collected ,• but I 
think that the balance of evidence points to the conclusion that the 
two forms are only subspeeifieally distinct, and that the intermediate 
iorms are fertile hybrids. The facts upon which I base my hypothesis 
are as follows :—There is no evidence that one form moults 
into the other, intermediate forms of every grade occurring in mid\\
inter. The black-headed form is by far the most numerous ; the 
intermediate forms are rare ; and the white-headed form is said to be 
still rarer,—which is precisely the case with the Carrion and Hooded 
Crows and their intermediate forms in the valley of the Yenesay. 
The geographical distribution of the two forms is almost identical: 
but it is suspected that the black-headed form alone occurs in some 
parts of Persia and Baluchistan, and the white-headed form alone 
in Turkestan.

chin, upper throat, and breast, shading into nearly white on the 
belly, and more or less suffused with buff on the under tail-coverts; 
rump and tail as in the male, except that the white is occasionally 
slightly suffused with buff, and the dark brown is not so dark. 
After the autumn moult no change in the appearance of the plumage 
occurs, except that the colours are richer and deeper. Birds of the 
year appear to be unknown. Young in first plumage resemble the 
female, but have obscure pale centres and dark margins to the 
feathers of the head, back, throat, and breast; the margins to the 
innermost secondaries and the tips of the quills and tail-feathers are 
broad and pale isabelline brown.

This is an excellent species, which has been most unaccountably 
and undeservedly overlooked by the French ornithologists, and by 
Messrs. Blanford and Dresser, when they examined the most interesting 
series of Chats in the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes. 
It is nearly allied to the preceding, but differs from it in the following 
particulars:—The white jm^fchejiead is more suffusedLwjth^pxy, 
and ends abruptly on the napeTand tlielSEito on thernmp jsjess 
developed, causing the black on the back to extend nearly twice the 
distance that it does in the northern species. The upper tail-coverts 
are slightly tinged with buff: the but? on the under taiksjoscris 
is rngggfe deeper^jn^colojir, approaching chestnut; the two centre 
tail-feathers are black for the terminal two thirds of their length, 
and the black tips to the remaining tail-feathers extend three 
quarters of an inch or more. Bill, lop, feet, and claws black. Wings 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest.

Adult famah in breeding-plumage. Rump, tail, and tail-coverts, 
both upper and under, as in the male, except that the black on the 
tail is replaced by dark brown. The rest of the upper parts are 
darkish brown, and the rest of the underparts are pale brown, with 
traces of darker centres to some of the feathers of the breast, which 
may be the remains of immature plumage. The basal portions of 
the inner margin of the quills are nearly white. Birds of the year 
and young in first plumage are unknown." 

Botta's Chat breeds in Sennaar, jSTorth-east Africa, where it is 

supposed to be a resident. 

The British Museum does not possess an example of this species. 
The types from which the above descriptions are taken are in the 
Museum of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and were collected by 

M. Botta in 1839. An adult male from the same collection is in my 
possession, for which I am indebted to the kindness of Prof. Alphonse 
Milne-Edwards.

white, more or less suffused with grey; lores, chin, throat, ear-
coverts, sides of neck, scapulars, hack, wing-coverts, axillarics, and 
under wing-coverts "black; quills dark brown, slightly paler on the 
under surface ; rump, upper tail-coverts, breast, flanks, belly, and 
under tail-coverts white ; tail white, the two central feathers nearly 
black for the terminal half, and the remainder tipped with nearly 
black from a quarter to half an inch. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
black. Wings with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal 
and longest, second primary about equal to the filth, bastard 
primary 0*8 to 0*6 inch. Length of wing 3-9 to 3*0 inches (female 
3*6 to 3*45), tail 2-G6 to 2*25, culmen 0*7 to 0*6, tarsus 1*0 
to 0-85. 
Adult female in breeding-plumage. The belly, rump, upper tail-
coverts, under tail-coverts, and tail are the same as in the male; 
the remainder of the upper parts are earthy brown. The same 
colour prevails on the underparts from the breast upwards, showing 
the black bases to the feathers on the throat. Aftjr the autumn 

moult the white feathers on the head, nape, breast, belly, and under 
tail-coverts of the male have brown edges, and all the black feathers 
are more or less edged with brown. Exactly the same change 
takes place in the female, the edges to the now feathers being paler 
than the centres, especially on the wing-coverts, innermost secondaries, 
and tips of the primaries.

The Siberian Pied Chat breeds in Cyprus, the Crimea, the Caucasus, 
the lower valley of the Volga, Persia, Afghanistan, Turkestan, 
Western Thibet, Mongolia, South-eastern Siberia, and ^"orth-west 
China. It has been found on migration in Palestine and Egypt, and 
winters in Abyssinia and Arabia, and probably in South-west Chiua. 
Lts occurrence in Algeria requires verification.

and behind the eye, ear-coverts, hack, scapulara, wing-coverts, 
chin, throat, breast, belly, axillaris, under wing-coverts, and thinks

centre feathers and an occasional spot on or near the tip of the 
others, which are brown. Hill, legs, feet, and claws black, Winj»s 
with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and

sixth, bastard primary 0*97> to 0-8 inch. Length of wing 4*1 

to 3'8 inches, tail 2-85 to 2-5, culmeii 0-93 to 0*7, tardus 1*07) 

to 1-0. 

It is not known that the ft male differs in any respect from the 
male. Immediately after the autumn moult the black parts are very 
rich and glossy. Birds of the year, and possibly ftmahs, have black 
heads and pale tips to the primary-coverts and the secondaries. 
Birds in intermediate plumage, with black heads interspersed with 
a few wrhite feathers, or with white heads interspersed with a few 
black feathers, occasionally occur. The length of^ bill is subject to 
great variation. In what I take to lie very old males white feathers 
appear on the shoulder. Young in Jint plumage resemble birds of 
the year, but are of a duller black colour, and ha\e obscure pale tips 
to the greater wing-coverts as well as to the primary v lug-coverts 
and secondaries, and have al>o white tips to all the tail-teat hers. 

The "White-riimped Chat appears to be a resident in Eastern Algeria,

Adult male in breeding-plumagz. General colour Mack; quills 
dark brown, paler on the under surface; rump, upper and under 
tail-coverts white; tail white, except the terminal half of the two 
centre feathers and the tips from a quarter to half an inch of the 
others, which are dark brown. Bill, logs, feet, and claws black. 
Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and 
longest, second primary intermediate in length between the sixth 
and seventh, bastard primary 1-02 to 0*85 inch. Length of wing 
3*8 to '&5Q inches, tail 2-6 to 2-5, culmen 0*8 to 0'7, tarsus 1*05 
to 1-01. 

There appears to be no seasonal change of plumage in this 
species. The female differs from the male in having the black parts 
dark brown, and in having the white parts slightly suffused with 
buff. Birds of the year probably scarcely differ from the adult. 
Young in first plumage differ from the female only in having obscure 
pale terminal spots on the greater wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries, and in having the quills narrowly margined with pale 
brown, and the tail-feathers tipped with white. 

The Black Chat breeds in South-western Europe, occasionally 
straggling as far east as Greece. A few remain to winter, but the 
majority migrate to Algiers.

brown; occasionally the brown on the five outside feathers on each 
side is confined to an oval spot on each web. Bill, legs, feet, and 
claws black. Wiug with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries 
nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate between 
the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 0-8 inch. Length of wing 
3-6 inches (female 3*52 to 3-46), tail 2-6, culmen 0-68 to OG5, tarsus

The female differs from the male in having the head and nape 
dark brown. No change apparently takes place after the autumn 
moult in either sex. It is not known that birds of the year differ 
from adults. Young hi first plumage appear to be unknown. 

Strickland's Chat breeds in the cultivated districts of South-western 
Turkestan, and winters in the North-west Provinces of India.

Saxicola leuconielaena and Saxicola monticola. 

These two South-African Chats and their intermediate forms are 
involved in the greatest obscurity ; an examination of a large series 
leads me to hazard the following hypothesis. The white-headed 
form alone appears to inhabit Benguella and Damara Land. Further 
south and east originally dwelt a black-headed form in Great Namaqua 
Land, the Free State, the Transvaal, and Natal. This region 
appears to have been invaded by the white-headed forms, which must 
have bred freely with, and been absorbed by, the original inhabitants, 
so that we now find in the regions inhabited by the black-headed 
form almost every intermediate form between the two. Curiously 
enough the intermediate forms are on an average slightly the largest 
birds. This may possibly be accounted for on the supposition that 
the cross-breeding improved the race, or that the half-breds had 
for some cause or other a harder struggle for existence, and the small 
examples were gradually eliminated by natural selection. It is 
probably a parallel case to 8. picata and 8. capistrata; but it may 
perhaps be best to classify the intermediate forms in two groups, 
calling those examples in which the head is light grey Saxicola 
leucomeltena monticola, and those in which the head is dark grey 
Saxicola monticola leucomrtcena, though, if my theory be correct, a 
large enough series will show not two intermediate forms only, but 
an infinite series. 

The synonymy of the white-headed form is as follows :—

Ada If male in hreedlng-plumaye. 
Head, nape, and hind neck white; 

lores, the feathers round the eye, ear-coverts, sides of the neck, back, 

and the whole of the underparts except the tips of the under tail-

coverts and part of the tail black; scapulars black, the outer webs 

of the outer ones white, joining onto the white upper and median 

wing-coverts ; rest of the wing dark brown ; lower rump, belly, and 

under tail-coverts white: longest upper tail-coverts black, tijjped 

with white, rest 
white ; two central tail-feathers dark brown, the 

two next with 
more or less white on the outer web; four out


side tail-feathers on each side white, generally one or more arid some


times all with a dark brown terminal patch on each web, occasionally 

becoming confluent; under surface of wing dark brown. Bill, legs, 

feet, and claws black. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth pri


maries nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate in 

length between 
the sixth and seventh, bastard primary 1*25 to 0*9 

inch. Length of wing 4*3 to 4-05 inches, tail 2*9 to 2'6, culmen 

0*85 to 0*70, tarsus 1*25 to 1*15. 

The female in breeding-plumage has the head, nape, rump, tail, 

and wings as in the male, except that the dark brown of the tail 

and wings is not so dark; all the rest of the parts are grey, shading 

into neaily white on the centre of the belly. The change which is 

produced by the autumn moult, which appears to take place in 

February and March, is unimportant. Young in first jjlumaye 

appear to be unknown; but birds of the year of both sexes have 

the rump, upper and under tail-coverts, and tail as in the adult, the 

whole of the rest of the plumage being brown. After the second 

moult the adult plumage is assumed, except that the belly of the 

male is white, the fully adult plumage with black belly apparently 

not being assumed until the third moult is complete. 

Burchells Chat has only been obtained from Benguela and Damara

The following is the synonymy of the intermediate forms, in which 
the predominant strain is apparently derived from the preceding :-—

p. 2?>3 (partim), pi. xxx\ii. fig. 1 (male). 
Saxicola tephronota, Gurnet/, Ibis, 1877, p. 343 (female). 
This is an intermediate form between S. montieola and 8. liitcomelcena. 
In typical examples the adult male differs from either of 
them in having the forehead, crown, and nape grey. It is also slightly 
larger than either of its near allies. Length of wing 4-55 to 4-35 
inches, tail 3*1 to 2-75, culmen 0*9 to 0*8, tarsus 1*35 to 1*2. 

The female is scarcely distinguishable from that of 8. lencomalwna, 
but is somewhat darker in colour and larger in size. The seasonal 
changes are unimportant. Males between the second and third moults 
have the belly white as in the allied forms. Youmj hi first plumage 
appear to be unknown. Birds of the t/ear supposed to belong to this 
form arc brown, except the rump, upper and under tail-m\ erts, and 
tail, which are coloured as in the adult. 

So far as is known, the geographical range of this form extends 

from Great Nam aqua Land, through Colesberg, Bloemfontein io 

Potchefbtroom in the Southern Transvaal. It is supposed to be a 

resident.

The dark-grey headed forms, which approach nearer to S. t/ionticola 
than they do to & leueomelcena, are fortunate in haying no synonymy. 
They may he called 

Saxicola monticola-leucomelana. 

This form is very nearly allied to Saxicola monticola. but diffeis 
from it in the adult male having the forehead, crown, and nape dark 
grey, with a broad ill-defined paler grey eye-stripe. It appears also 
to be intermediate in size between the preceding and the follow ing 
forms. Length of wing 4*5 to 4*2 inches, tail 3*0 to 2*0, culinen 0-&8 
to 0-8, tarsus 1-34 to 1*21. 

Tlhe female is a darker grey even than that of S. moniicola ; but the 
upper and median wing-coverts are white. The seasonal changes 
are unimportant; the annual moult takes place in January and 
February. The male of the second year has the belly white, ah in the 
nearly allied species. Young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 
Birds of the year are entirely brown, with the exception of the rump, 
upper and under tail-coverts, and tail, which are coloured as in the 
adults. 

This form is only known from Potchefstroom, Colesberg. and Xatal. 
It is supposed to be a resident.

In this form the adult male has the entire head black, except 
occasionally a narrow white eye-stripe above the lores ; it is also a 
slightly larger bird than S. leueomelcena, which it otherwise resembles. 
Length of wing 4-4 to 4-2 iaches, tail 3*0 to 2-8, culxncn 
0*9 to 0-8, tarsus 1-4 to 1*25. 

The female differs from that of S. leiteomelama in being of a 
much darker grey colour, and in having the upper and median 
wing-coverts pale grey instead of white. The seasonal changes 
appear to be unimportant. Males of the second year have the belly 
white. Young in first plumage appear to be unknown. Birds of 
the year are entirely brown, except the rump, upper and under tail-
coverts, and tail, which are coloured as in the adult. 

The Mountain-Chat has a wide range, extending from Great 
Namaqua Land through Colesberg, Bloemfontein, and the Transvaal 
as far north as Rustenberg. It is believed to be a resident.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour of the upper 
parts greyish brown, shading into dull chestnut on the rump and 
upper tail-coverts. Lores, chin, throat, cheeks, ear-coverts, and sides 
of the neck black; eye-stripe greyish white, extending to the nape ; 
wings brown, the greater wing-coverts and secondaries with pale 
tips; tail dark brown, the basal third of the two centre feathers 
and the basal two thirds of the remainder white; axillarics and 
under wing-coverts black ; breast and belly greyish white, shading 
into dull chestnut on the flanks and under tail-coverts. Bill, legs, 
feet, and claws black. Wings with the third, fourth, and fifth

primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary intermediate in 

length between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary 0'65 inch. 

Length of wing 3*7 inches, tail 2*4, culmen 0*7, tarsus 0*94. 

The female appears to be unknown. It is not known whether 

any change in the colour of the plumage is produced by the autumn 

moult. Males of the year have the black feathers replaced by dark 

brown, and the feathers of the throat are tipped with brown. 

Young in first plumage are unknown. 

The Bed-rumped Chat appears to be confined to Xubia, where 

it is probably a resident. 

There is no example of this very rare Chat in the British Museum. 

The type (male of the year) is in the Berlin Museum, a second male 

of the year is in the collection of Mr. E. Cavendish Taylor, and an 

adult male is in the collection of Canon Tristram. JS"O other examples 

are known.

upper tail-coverts white, more or less suffused with buff. "Wings and 
wing-coverts brown, more or less broadly edged with white on the 
outer webs; rump and upper tail-coveits buff; tail brown, the 
basal half of the outside feathers, the basal third of the centre, and 
nearly two thirds of the rest pale dull chestnut; lores, ear-coverts, 
cheeks, chin, throat, sides of neck, axillaries, and under wing-
coverts sooty black; the rest of the underparts white, slightly 
suffused with buff on the breast and more so on the under tail-
coverts ; inner margin of quills greyish white. Bill, legs, feet, and 
claws black. Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly

to 2-7, culmen 0*8 to 0*72, tarsus 1-16 to 1*0. 

In the female the forehead, crown, and nape are pale dull chestnut, 
shading into lavender-grey on the back and again into pale 
dull chestnut on the rump and upper tail-coverts. Tail-feathers as 
in the male; lores and ear-coverts dull chestnut; underparts pale 
buff, darker on the breast and under tail-coverts, and greyer on the 
axillaries; inner margin of quills pale buff. After the autumn 
moult the head and nape are suffused with grey, leaving a narrow 
pale eye-stripe, and the innermost secondaries have bnff margins.

brown, margined with buff; basal half of two central taiL-featbers 

white, terminal half black; remainder of tail-feathers with rather 

more than the basal half white ; tmderparts below the throat pale 

buff, richest on the chest and palest on the under tail-coverts; 

axillaries and under wing-coverts black, with white tips; inner 

margin of quills white. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Winers 

with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second 

primary intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, bastard 

primary 0-75 to 0*05 inch. Length of wing 3*9 to 3*6 inches 

(females 3-5 to 3*3), tail 2-QQ to 2-35, culmen 0*65 to 0*6, tarsus 

1*1 to 1*0. 

Adult ft wale in breeding-plumage. The black on the lores, the 

feathers behind the eye, the ear-coverts, the sides of the neck, the 

cheeks, the chin, 
and the throat is replaced by buff, the nearly 

black wings and wing-coverts by brown, the rump and upper tail-

coverts are more suffused with buff, and the black on the tail is 

replaced by dark brown. I can find no satisfactory evidence that any 

important change in the coloration takes place by the autumn moult. 

JIales of the year have the black feathers on the throat and wings 

narrowly margined with buff. Females of the year scarcely diffrr 

from adults. Young in first plumage have pale centres to the 

feathers of both the upper and under parts, except to those of the 

rump and belly- The quills and tail-feathers are tipped with buff. 

Females of this species much resemble 8. isabelliua, but may at 

once be distinguished by their smaller feet. 

The Desert-Chat is a resident of the arid plains of the Algerian 

Sahara, Egypt, Nubia, Palestine, Arabia, and the highlands of 

Southern Persia. A few wander into Abyssinia in winter. East


wards it breeds in the plains of Turkestan and winters in Balu

The^ adult male in breeding-plumage differs from that of the 
preceding species in. being slightly larger, in having scarcely 
any trace of buff on the breast and belly, which is nearly pure 
white, and in having the basal half of the inner web of the primaries 
and of the adjoining five secondaries white to the shaft, a character 
which is as strongly developed in the young in first plumage as in 
the adult. Length of wing 4-0 to 3Y inches (females 3*9 to 3*0), 
tail 2-75 to 2-35, culmen 0-74 to 0-G8, tarsus 1*1 to 0*95. 

The female scarcely differs in colour from that of the preceding 
species, but is a much larger bird. After the autumn moult the 
black feathers of the throat are tipped with buff. Males of the year 
resemble females, except in having the basal half of the inner web 
of the primaries and of the adjoining secondaries white to the shaft, 
a character which is also as strongly marked in males in first plumage. 
Young in first plumage of both sexes are greyer in colour than 
females, and have the feathers of the breast and back with obscure 
pale centres and dark margins. 

Gould's Chat breeds in Thibet and Eastern Turkestan, migrating

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour "wMte, frequently 
suffused with grey on the head and with buff on the back and 
breast; a patch of black on the sides of the head includes a narrow 
frontal line, the lores, the feathers round the eye, the ear-coverts, 
and extends some way down the sides of the neck, embracing the 
entire chin and throat, but not extending quite to the wing; wings, 
wing-coverts, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and under surface of 
wings black; tail-feathers white, the two central feathers black for 
.the terminal two thirds, the two outer feathers broadly tipped with 
black, the black tips to the remainder being narrower, and generally 
quite obsolete on several. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. 'Wing 
with the third tnd fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, 
bastard primary 0*85 to 0*6 inch. Length of wing 3*65 to 3*8 
inches, tail 2*4 to 2*25, culmen 0*6 to 0*55, tarsus 0*85 to 0*83. 

In the female the general colour of the upper parts is an almost 
uniform brown, darker on the wings and darkest on the tail; the 
rump and the white on the tail-feathers are the same as in the male; 
the feathers of the throat are buff, showing half-concealed dark 
bases; breast buff, shading into huffish white on the rest of the 
underparts, except the axillaries and under wing-coverts, which are 
dark brown. It is not known that any change in the colour of the 
plumage is produced by the autumn moult. Birds of the year have

The Eastern form of the Black-throated Chat breeds in Italy, 
Greece, South Russia, Abia Minor, Palestine, and South Persia; it 
parses through Egypt and Nubia on migration, and probably winters 
in Central Africa.

This is a "Western form of S. melanoleuca, differing only in having 
the black on the throat not extending beyond the upper throat. I t 
is also more constantly suffused with buff on the back and breast. 
Intermediate forms occur; and examples from Spain, in which the 
black on the throat is more extended than usual, are indistinguishable 
from examples from Asia Minor, in which the black on the 
throat is less extended than usual There is no difference in size. 
It appears to go through the same changes of plumage as its Eastern 
ally, and both males and females are on an average more rufous at 
all seasons. 

The Western form of the Black-throated Chat breeds in the south 

of France, Spain, Western Algiers, and Morocco, wintering in 

Western Africa.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour white, occasionally 
suffused with grey or buff; lores, sides of the neck, ear-
coverts, chin, throat, upper breast, scapulars, wing-coverts, quills, 
axillaries, and under wing-coverts black; tail-feathers white, the 
two central feathers black for the terminal half, the remaining 
feathers tipped with black from a quarter to half an inch; under 
surface of quills dark brown, paler on the margin of the basal half 
of the inner webs. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. WTing with 
the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, 
second primary slightly shorter than the fifth, bastard primary 
0*8 to 0*7 inch. Length of wing 3*6 to 3*25 inches (females 3*3 to 
3*1), tail 2*4 to 2*15, culmen 0-08 to 0*62, tarsus 1*0 to 0*9. 

In the female the rump, upper tail-coverts, tail, and the underpays 
below the breast resemble the male; the rest of the upper 
parts are grey, darker and browner on the wings * the feathers of 
the chin and throat are pale grey, with more or less concealed black 
bases. Nothing is known of the changes of plumage which this 
Chat undergoes, except that in females of the year the pale grey tips 
to the feathers of the throat entirely conceal the dark bases.

The Euphrates Pied Chat breeds in the rocky hills of the Caucasus, 
Eastern Asia Minor, Palestine, and Persia, its range extending 
only a short distance beyond the valley of the Euphrates, in 
Palestine it is a resident, but it appears to leave the other parts of 
its breeding-range, and, passing through Egypt on migration, winters 

in Nubia.

dark brown; ear-coverts darkish brown; eye-stripe somewhat indistinct, 
pale grey; wings brown, the secondaries tipped with 
greyish white and margined with greyish buff; upper tail-coverts 
pale dull chestnut; tail darkish brown, the basal third of the two 
centre feathers and the basal three fourths of the others dull chestnut. 
Chin, throat, and centre of belly greyish white, shading into

The female scarcely differs from the male, nor is any important 
change of colour produced by the autumn moult. Birds of the year 
and young in first plumage appear to be unknown. 

The Red-tailed Chat breeds in the rocky hills of Persia, and 
winters in Baluchistan, Scinde, and North-west India.

Adult male in hreedmrj-jphimage. General colour of the upper 
parts brown; lores dark brown; ear-coverts russet-brown ; wings 
brown, the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries narrowly margined 
with pale brown ; rump and upper tail-coverts chestnut; two 
centre tail-feathers dark brown, with chestnut babes less than one 
third of the entire length, the remainder chestnut, with brown 
tips about a quarter of an inch in extent. Underparts, including 
the axillaries, under wing-coverts, and inner margin of quills, are 
almost uniform pale huffish brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
black. Wing with the third, fourth, and fifth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary about equal to the seventh, 
bastard primary 0*9 to 0*85 inch. Length of wing 3*65 to 3*1.5 
inches, tail 2-65 to 2-35, culnien 0*7 to (f-08, tarsus 1-01 to 0*94. 

In the female the lores are coloured like the crown, otherwise the 
plumage resembles that of the male. After the autumn moult the 
pale edges to the wing-coverts and secondaries are somewhat 
broader. Birds of the year are supposed to be similar to adults. 
Young in first plumage have pale centres and dark tips to most of 
the small feathers. 

The Familiar Chat appears to be a resident in Benguela, Damara 
Land, Xamaqua Land, Fatal, the Transvaal, and the Cape Colony.

This is another of M. Botta's discoveries which has escaped iho 
attention of ornithologists in the Museum of the Jardin dea 
Plaiitcs. It differs from its South-African ally in being a larger 
bird and slightly darker in colour. The most marked difference is 
in. the distribution of the colours on the feathers of the tail; the 
dark brown on the two centre feathers is much less developed, only 
extending* to the terminal half, whilst the dark brown on the remaining 
feathers is much more developed, extending for more than 
half an inch. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Wings with the 
third and fourth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
intermediate in length between the fifth and sixth, bastard primary 
0-8 inch. Length of wing 3*7 inches, tail 2*47, culinon 0*7, tarsus I'D. 

Nothing is known of the difference which may be attributable 
to age, sex, or season. 

The only example known of the Sennaar Familiar Chat is the 
type, from which the above description is taken, in the Museum 
of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, which was obtained by M. Botta 
in Sennaar in 1839.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour of thte upper 
parts pale slate-grey; forehead and eye-stripe, -which extends to the 
nape, white; lores and upper part of the ear-coverts "black; wings 
and wing-coverts nearly black, a few traces of the autumnal huff 
margins to the feathers generally left; rump and upper tail-coverts 
white ; tail white, except the tei minal three fifths of-the two centre 
feathers, and the terminal fourths of the others, which are nearly 
black. Underparts very pale huff, slightly darker on the throat 
and breast; axillarics and under wing-coverts white, with dark 
centres; inner margin of quills brown. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
black. Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and

1-2 to 1-03. 

Aftult finurft in hreedimj-plwrnuge. General colour of the upper 
parts dull brown; forehead and eye-stripe bullish white, much 
narrower than in the male ; lores and upper part of tiio oar-coverts 
brown ; wings and wing-coverts not HO dark as in the male ; rump 
and upper tail-coverts white; tail as in the male, but the dark 
parts not quite so dark; underparis as in the male. Afttr 
the autumn moult both sexes have a bullish-brown margin to every 
feather, so that they are scarcely distinguishable, and resemble the 
adult female in breeding-plumage except that the quills and tail-
feathers are margined with huffish brown at the tip, and the innermost 
secondaries and wing-coverts are similarly margined, not only 
at the tip but along the outside webs. The underparts are also 
darker in colour. It is not known that birds of the i/((tr differ 
from adults. Foung in first jplumatje resemble the female, but 
have obscure transverse loiminal dark bars and pale centres to most 
of the feathers of the upper and under parts. 

The Wheatcar Chat breeds throughout Central and Northern 
Europe as far north as land exists, and in Southern Europe where 
the mountains are high enough to allow of the growth of the pine 
and birch. "Westwards its breeding-range extends over Iceland as 
far as Greenland and Labrador, and eastwards throughout Northern 
Siberia, the mountains of Persia and Syria, and beyond Beliring's 
Straits into Alaska. In winter it is found in North and West Africa 
and the east coast south of the equator. The Asiatic birds migrate to 
Mongolia, Northern India, and Persia. On the American continent 
it has been found in winter as far south as the Bermudas.

* According to the rules of the British Association, the name by which this 
bird ought to be called is either 8. stapazina or S. alhieolUs. The former 
name is out of court, haying been extensively applied to another species, which 
was probably intended to be included by Linnaeus under his name. The latter 
I reject on the ground that the name given by Temminek has been used by an 
o^erwhelmi^g majority of ornithologists, and ought therefore to stand.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour white, frequently 
suffused with grey on the head and with buff on the back and breast, 
the remains of immature plumage; a patch of black on the sides of 
the head includes a narrow frontal line, the lores, the feathers round 
the eye, the ear-coverts, and extends some way down the sides of 
neck ; wing-coverts, axillaries, under wing-coverts, and under surface 
of quills black; tail-feathers white, the two central feathers black 
for the terminal two thirds, the two outer feathers broadly tipped 
with black, the black tips to the remainder being narrower and 

generally almost obsolete on several. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
black. Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly equal and 
longest, second primary slightly shorter than the fourth, bastard 
primary 0-65 to 0*7. Length of wing 3*6 to 3'5 inches (females 3*5 
to 3-4), tail 2-45 to 2-3, culmen 0-65 to 0-6, tarsus 0*9 to 0-85. 

The female differs from the male in having all the black parts 
replaced by brown. The head and back are also paler brown, and 
the throat and breast suffused with brown. It is not known that 
any change takes place in the colour of the plumage of adults in 
consequence of the autumn moult* but birds of the year are suffused 
with grey on the head, with both grey and buff on the back, and 
with buff on the breast and flanks, the wing-coverts and innermost 
secondaries are broadly edged with buff, the primaries narrowly 
tipped with buff, and the tail-feathers narrowly tipped with white. 
Young in first plumage have obscure pale centres and dark terminal 
bands to the feathers of the head, back, and breast, and

the wing-coverts and innermost secondaries are broadly edged5 and 

the quills and tail-feathers broadly tipped with birff. 

The Black-eared Chat breeds throughout Southern Europe, and 

occasionally in Xorth Africa, extending eastwards to Asia Minor, 

Palestine, and South Persia. A few remain to winter in AIgi«er->; 

but the majority pass on to Senegal and probably to Central Africa, 

since it is found only during the breeding-season in Egypt and 

Nubia, and has not been recorded from Abyssinia.

which takes place in December, the quills and tail-feathers arts 
slightly darker in colour and have while tips. Birds of the y<ar 
probably do not differ from adults. Young in, first plumage are 
described by Andersson as having the tipper parts and the breast 
mottled with brown. 

The Pale Chat has only been found in Damara Land, near the

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour of the upper 
parts sandy brown (varying in individuals from dull brown to 
sandy brown, according to climate) ; eye-stripe pale buff, obscure, 
and extending to the nape; lores black ; upper part of ear-coverts 
slightly darker than sides of neck ; wings and wing-eoverts brown, 
all the feathers with more or less distinct paler margins ; ramp and 
npper tail-coverts white; tail white, except the terminal three 
fourths of the two centre feathers and the terminal two fifths of the 
others, which are dark brown. Underparts pale buff, slightly 
darker on the throat and breast; axillaries and under wing-coverts 
nearly white; inner margin of quills pale bnrT. Bill, legs, feet, 
and claws black. Wing with the third and fourth primaries nearly 
equal and longest, second primary sometimes as long as the fourth, 
bastard primary 0*7 to 0*01 inch. Length of wing 3*9 to 3*6 
inches (females 3*8 to 3*5), tail 2*3 to 2*05, culmen 0*71 to 0*09, 
tarsus 1*19 to 1*08. 
The adult female in breeding-pit image scarcely differs from the 
male. After the autumn moult the quills and tail-feathers are 
margined with sandy brown at the tip, and the innermost secondaries 
and wing-coverts are similarly margined, not only at the tip, 
but along the outside webs * the underparts are also slightly darker

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour of the upper 
parts dull russet-brown; lores nearly black; upper parts of the earooverts 
dark brown; eye-stripe white, extending only above the 
lores; wings and wing-coverts brown, the greater wing-coverts 
margined with dull chestnut; rump and upper tail-coverts white ; 
tail white, except the terminal two thirds of the two centre feathers 
and the terminal third of the rest, which are dark brown. Chin 
and throat white, shading into brownish buff on the breast, slightly 
paler on the centre of the belly and under tail-coverts; axillaries 
and under wing-coverts nearly white; inner margin of quills pale 
dull buff. Bill, legs, feet, and claws black. Wing with the third, 
fourth, and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, second primary 
about equal to the sixth, bastard primary 0*9 to 0*8 inch. Length 
of wing 3*92 to 3*82 inches (female 3*5), tail 2*56 to 2*41, oulmen 
0-8 to 0-7, tarsus 1-35 to 1-29. 

It is not known that the female differs from the male, except in 
size. After the autumn moult the tips of the tail-feathers are narrowly 
margined with white. Birds of the year and young in first 
plumage appear to be unknown. 

The Abyssinian Chat appears to be confined to the highlands of 
Abyssinia, whe^e it is supposed to be a resident.

By the kindness of Captain "Wardlaw Eamsay, I have had an 
opportunity of examining the example of the Ouzel obtained by 
Dr. Jerdon in Cashmere, and now in the Tweedclalc Collection. It 
appears to me to belong to the largo race of Merula merula which 
Br. Scully found at Yarkand, and which is probably entitled to at 
least subspecifio rank. The measurements of this example are as 
follows :—Length of wing b'Sb inches, tail 4*9, culmen 0*95, tarsus 
1-5. Wing with the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and 
longest, second primary intermediate in length between the sixth 
and seventh, bastard primary 1*0 inch. Bill, legs, feet, and claws 
dark brown. The plumage is intermediate between young in first 
plumage and male of the year, and probably, had the first moult 
been completed, would not have differed in colour from the European 
species. 
The Eastern Blackbird is only known from the three examples 
alluded to, obtained in Eastern Turkestan and Cashmere, where it 
apparently breeds at great elevations [Cashmere, July, 12,000 feet], 
and winters in the valleys. In both localities it is said not to be 
uncommon; and it is probable that in a large series small examples 
might be found which would be undistinguishable from the largest 
examples of the European race, in which case the difference between 
the two forms would only be subspecific.

Ruticilla monssieri.—This species lias the habits of a Satricola, 
with which genus it also agrees in the shortness of its tail. It 
appears to me to be undoubtedly a Pratineola. 

Page 365. 

Saxicola infuseata.—This species, with its scutellated tarsus and 
its spotted young in first plumage, does not agi*ee with my diagnosis 
either of Sylviince or Turdince. I suspect it to be a Bradyornis. 

Page 365. 

Saxicola shelleyi, S. arnotti, and their allied species are very 
closely connected with Myrmecocklila ; but their first primaries are 
so much developed that they undoubtedly form part of Mr. Sharpe's 
Timeliidae, where they may be placed in the genus ThammJAa. I 
am sorry I cannot include them in my volume.
