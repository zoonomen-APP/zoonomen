PEEPACE. 

THIS volume contains a complete account of all the species of 
Diurnal Birds of Prey known at present, 377 in number, of which 
only about twenty-five are desiderata in the Collection of the British 
Museum. In the year 1848, when the Catalogue of Aocvpitres 
prepared by the late Mr. G-eorge Eobert Gray was published by 
order of the Trustees, 198 species were contained in the Museum. 

This Catalogue has been prepared by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, one 
of the Senior Assistants in the Department of Zoology.

INTRODUCTION. 

THE total number of species of Diurnal Birds of Prey at present 
known amounts to 377. Of these, about 23 are doubtful or 
problematical; and of the remaining 354, 326 are represented in 
the collection of the British Museum. 

The total number of specimens enumerated in this volume amounts 
to 2466. Of the numerous acquisitions by which the collection has 
recently been enriched, the following are the most important:— 

1. The complete collection of Mr. Wallace, which was secured last 
year by the Trustees, and supplied a considerable number of desiderata, 
besides completing the series of many Moluccan species. 
2. The collection of Birds of Prey of John Gould, Esq., F.R.S., 
including the series of Falcons described and figured by him in the 
' Birds of Great Britain.' 
3. The entire collection of birds formed by Major J. Hayes Lloyd 
in Kattiawar, and presented by him to the Museum. 
4. A large collection of South-African birds, presented by John 
Ilocke, Esq. 
5. A series of many fine specimens of some of the rarer European 
Birds of Prey, presented by Baron A. von Hxigel. 
6. The collection of Eagles made by Dr. Strader in the district 
of the Southern Ural and adjacent parts. 
The list of desiderata has also been considerably decreased by 
presents from the following gentlemen:—Professor Schlegel, Dr. 
Westerman, Captain Shelley, Mr. W. Wilson Saunders, Yiscount 
Walden, Messrs. Henry Ansell, A. Bouvier, Howard Saunders, W. 

T. Blanford, J. H. Grurney, Captain Unwin, Professor Newton, and 
the Eev. Chancellor Augustus Morgan. 
Vii i INTE0BTJCTI03S". 

The special thanks of the Author for valuable assistance and loan 
of specimens are due to the Marquis of Huntly, Prof. Peters, Dr. 
Otto Finsch, Dr. Cabanis, Prof. Barboza du Bocage, Dr. Dubois, 
Count Salvador!, Messrs. Salvin and Godman, G. Gillett, H. E. 
Dresser, Basil Brooke, and Canon Tristram. 

It remains only to explain the affixes to the names of the persons 
from whom the specimens were obtained. "[P.]" means "Presented 
by; " «[C.]" = "Collected by;" «[E.]"="Obtained by 
exchange."

Adult. Entirely black, with, chocolate-brown reflections; crop-
patch black; head covered with thick velvety down, collecting towards 
the occiput and forming there a conspicuous patch; down on 
sides of face more bristly, especially on the lores; above the eye 
and on the cheeks the down is rather more silky, and produced in a 
couple of elongated tufts ; all the rest of the head and neck, both 
behind and laterally, is bare, of a livid flesh-colour in life; chin 
covered with bristly down, becoming scantier on the throat, on the 
lower part of which is a small projecting tuft of feathers; bill black; 
f~et yellowish; iris dark brown*. Total length about 42 inches, 
culmen 3*3, wing about 30, tarsus 4.

* This stage, which was erroneously described as the young in Dresser^

by Major Irby, who has studied the living birds in their wild state.

After a lengthened study of the Griffon Vultures I have come to 
the conclusion that there are only five distinguishable species. 

G. indicus is at once separated by its unusually bare head and 
thin bill; but the remaining species are more difficult to define. 
G. ruepjpelli when fully adult is unmistakable,' but when young 
more nearly resembles the other Griffons. G. Jcolbi is characterized 
by its light and almost uniform coloration, and looks much more 
distinct when seen alive side by side with the true G. fulvus; and 
G. liimalayensis is a large edition of G. kolbi, but is further remarkable 
for its brown-coloured young. The true G. fulvus (that is to 
say, the bird best agreeing with Albin's plate on which Gmelin 
founded his species) seems to be the Vulture from Eastern Europe, 
extending westwards as far as Sardinia; for the types of 67. occidentalism 
SchL, which I saw recently in the Leiden Museum, agree with 
the Dalmatian specimens. In Spain and Algeria, however, the 
Griffons are smaller and more rufous, and approach the Indian birds 
which Mr. Hume has named G. fulvescens. Taking, therefore, the 
three birds mentioned as subspecies of one well-marked form, we 
can separate them as follows.— 
a. 
Crop-patch dark brown. 
a'. General colour pale ashy fulvus. 
b'. General colour rufescent fulvescens. 
b. Crop-patch tawny, like rest of plumage hispaniolemix. 
Amidst the variations of plumage, however, it appears to me to be 
difficult to draw an exact line between these three subspecies.

Hah. Spain and Northern Africa, ranging far into the interior; 
(?) N.E. Africa. 

Obs. The Griffon Vulture of N.E. Africa still requires identification 
; and I have not been able to examine specimens. The bird 
procured by Major Denham in Central Africa, and still preserved in 
the Museum, appears to me to belong to the rufous race of Algeria 
and Spain; on the other hand Mr. E. C. Taylor tells me that he never 
saw the slightest difference between the Gyps of Egypt and the 
ordinary Griffon of the other countries of S.E. Europe; but he collected 
no specimens. If Dr. von Heugiin's identification be correct, 
the bird from N.E. Africa may be the true G. fulvus; or, again, 
both races may occur there, the one coming from the north, the 
other from the west. On this subject see Yon Heugiin's recent remarks 
(Nachtr. Orn.^f.-Afr. p. 1).

I have not had an opportunity of examining the following 
species:— 

6. &yps palleseens. 
Gyps indicuSj Hume, Bough Xotes, i. p. 21 (1869). 
Gyps pallescerts, Hume, Sir. F. i. p. 150 (1873). 


" I hare some reasons for believing that the Subhimalayan Thin-
billed Vulture, which seems always to breed on trees (Hodgson's 

G. teniticeps, as his drawings clearly prove), at all times apparently 
a darker bird, is distinct from our < plainsJ species, which always 
breeds on cliffs, the adult of which is very pale. If this be so, then 
it remains to make certain whether Scopoli's name of indicus really 
applies to our bird? which is apparently doubtful. If not, the bird 
described by me will need a name, and may perhaps stand as G. 
jjalltsceas, nobis/' (Hume, 1. c.) 
If the difference between these Thin-billed Vultures should turn 
out to be of specific value, the bird here described by Mr. Hume 
must surely be the true Viilivr indicus, as far as Sonnerafs description 
and figure will allow us to determine, and the Himalayan bird 
will stand as G. tenuirostris, Hodgs.

the opinion that there is a second species of Condor. The specimen 
figured by Eydoux and Souleyet seems to belong to the smaller species, 
which is distinctly stated, in the paper above referred to, to be 
not the young of S. gryphus. A specimen was living in the spring 
of 1873 in the Zoological Gardens at Amsterdam, apparently fully 
adult, with a perfectly formed erect wattle, but brown in colour all

tail. No bird answering to Bartram's description has been found in the locality.

Cassin described (Enops iota at one time as smaller, and at another as larger 
than (E. aura. The specimen figured by Cassin as (E. iota (Molina) is the 
small black species of Amazonia and Peru, here named (E. pernigra. He does 
not mention that a Chilian specimen is figured; and as Turkey Vultures were 
collected in many localities by the expedition, it is probable that the bird figured 
was not from Chili. All the specimens I have seen from the latter country 
seem identical with 0, aura of N. America; but D'Orbigny's coloured plate 
illustrates a bird distinct from that species, and doubtless my (Enops pernigra. 
The ordinary Vulture of Western Brazil still remains unidentified by me; but 
should it be the same as the Amazonian bird, the species may have to be called 
(Enops ntficollis (Spix). My birds' heads, however, are so distinctly yellow 
that I cannot believe in their identity with Spix's species. They are also rather 
smaller than the Turkey Vulture of N. America, and always of a deeper black 
colour, as is shown by Cassin's excellent figure (I <?.). Mr, Allen, moreover, 
states that the Brazilian bird is identical with the Chilian, I examined a bird 
from Surinam in the Leiden Museum, and believe it to be identical with (E. 
pernigra, and not with (E. aura. It measured 26 inches in length, and had the 
wing'21. Another from Brazil (No. 5 of Schlegel's Cat.) was 24*5 inches long, 

and measured 20*5 in the wing. 

* There can be little doubt that this species is quite distinct from (E. aitra, 
which it resembles 
much in plumage, but is distinguished by the grey on the

in the collection being one from North America, presented by Lord Odo Bussell, 
and measuring as follows—total length about 29 inches, wing 19*8, tail 11*3, 
tarsus 2-7; with this the above measurements should be compared. 

* In the ' Annals' for February 1873, I was inclined to unite this species 
with (Enops burroviana of Cassin, and suggested that a specimen in the national 
collection from Jamaica might be that species; but Mr. Elliot, who has described 
and figured the type (I. c), and who thus knows the species, assures me that the 
Jamaican bird can be nothing but (E. aura. Br. Sclater also tells me that he 
examined the type specimen in Philadelphia, and believes that (E. burroviana 
is only a small (K aura ; and Mr. Elliot does not give much credit to it as a 
species. The latter gentleman makes no mention of the shafts of the quills in 
his description; and as this is (with the orarge head) the character of (E. urubitinga, 
it seems best to keep the two species separate until such time as a 
comparison of actual specimens shall dissipate the uncertainty. Mr. Allen 
(Bull. Harv. Coll. ii. p. 312) also regards the species as based upon an " unusually 
small specimen " of (E. aura. The synonymy is as follows:—

AH the toes connected near the base by interdigital membrane; 
sides of face for the most part bare. 

The members of this subfamily are chiefly American, and are 
rather Gallinaceous in their habits, thus approaching the Turkey 
Yultures, with which they are closely associated by Professor Sundevall 
(AY. Tent pp. 109-111). Several subgenera axe included 
within the genus Ibycter, but are treated here as of subordinate 
rank in the face of the instability of the characters and the gradual 
gradation of one form towards another. The same idea was once 
entertained by Br. Kaup (Arch. f. Naturg. vol. xvii. 1850, p. 41) 
before he had " given up subgenera, and had raised all subgenera 
established by him to the dignity of genera" (P. Z. S. 1867, 

p. 169).

* Brown's " Tawny Vulture " has been considered by some ornithologists to 
be a Polyborus. The figure is not recognizable; but if the locality, " Falkland 
Islands," is correct, it is probably the young of Ibycter australis, as Polyborus 
does not occur there. The synonymy is as follows:—

Young. Above rather rufous brown, with, distinct straw-coloured 
margins to most of the feathers of the back; the head minutely 
spotted with straw-colour, and streaked more distinctly with the 
same on the sides of the crown, especially over the eye, where a 
distinct eyebrow is formed; the hind neck more distinctly streaked 
with straw-colour, the sides of the neck being entirely of the latter 
colour, some of the feathers with brown margins; feathers behind 
the eye and ear-coverts uniform brown, the latter with somewhat of 
a rufous tint; fore part of cheeks and chin almost uniform yellowish 
white; rest of under surface deep straw-yellow or ochre, the feathers 
margined with brown on the chest, causing a striped appearance; the 
flanks and thigh-feathers spotted on both webs or barred across with 
brown; the under tail-coverts uniform straw-yellow; quills dark 
brown; primaries externally whitish at base, freckled with brown ; 
all the quills white at base of inner web, shading into rufous, barred 
with dark brown, the bars on the primaries narrower; under wing-
coverts rufous-ochre, thickly barred with dark brown ; upper tail-
coverts pale buny cream-colour, "with indistinct remains of brown 
bars; tail-feathers also cream-coloured, crossed with seven bars of 
dark brown somewhat washed with rufous; the tips whitish, preceded 
by a very broad subterminal band of dark brown. Total 
length 16 inches, wing 11*2, tarsus 2*05. 

The progress from the young to the adult stage seems to be effected 
by a gradual change of the feather, the brown on the head, neck, 
and under parts gradually disappearing, and the cream-coloured 
centres widening out until they occupy the whole of the feather. 
The brown bars on the lower part of the tail also diminish in extent 
and grow narrower. 

Adult. Above brown, with pale ashy brown margins to the 
feathers of the back, scapulars, and wing-coverts; quills dark sepia-
brown ; secondaries of the same colour as the back, all tipped with 
whity brown; primaries white at base of both webs; head and 
neck all round (excepting a little streak of brown behind the eye) 
and entire underparts, including the under wing- and tail-eoverts, 
white ; upper tail-coverts and tail for two thirds of its length white, 
the latter barred with brown, the middle feathers also somewhat 
freckled with brown; the terminal third of the tail blackish brown, 
forming a broad dark band slightly tipped with white; feet pale 
yellow; bare space round eye tinged with rose-colour; iris whitish. 
Total length 16 inches, culmen 1*35, wing 10*5, tail 7*2, tarsus 2.

Adult. Above rufous brown, with ashy-brown margins to the 
feathers, not very distinctly indicated; head and neck more decidedly 
rufous, with longitudinal black centres to the feathers, giving 
a somewhat striped appearance; wing-coverts coloured like the 
back; primary coverts whitish, freckled minutely with greyish 
brown, with three very indistinct narrow cross lines of brown; quills 
deep brown, with white shafts, and externally shaded with ashy 
grey; secondaries coloured like back; primaries whitish at base, 
externally freckled with greyish brown like the primary coverts; 
inner face of quills at base buff, more rufous towards the inner ones, 
which are also slightly barred; upper tail-coverts dull white; tail 
ashy grey, whitish at base, minutely freckled with greyish brown 
and crossed with a broad subterminal band of dark brown, the tip 
whity brown; frontal feathers and a narrow superciliary line terminating 
above the ear black; sides of face and of neck brownish 
ochre; the cheeks slightly streaked with black; under surface of 
body brownish ochre, with distinct shaft-stripes of dark brown, and 
the feathers inclining to whitish ashy at tip, causing a somewhat 
mottled appearance; thighs and under tail-coverts paler ochre, the 
latter inclining to whitish; under wing-coverts rufous brown, barred 
with ochre, the greater ones entirely of the latter colour, with narrow 
brown cross bars; cere dull pink; feet bright yellow; iris 
hazel-brown. Total length 15*7 inches, culmen 1*1, wing 11-5, 
tail 6*7, tarsus 2-55. 
Young, Yery similar to adult, but more rufous; the feathers of 
the upper surface tipped with whitish, and the under surface also 
more distinctly mottled with the latter colour; thighs deep rufous 
ochre; quills much as in adult, but the base of primaries and the 
primary coverts more coarsely vermiculated and washed with rufous; 
tail creamy buff at base, shading into rufous at tip, all very coarsely

freckled with, dark brown, except the extremities of the feathers, 
which, do not, however, show a very distinct band. 

The type of Mr. Gould's M. hypersiictus is in the Museum, and is, 
I believe, the very old bird of this species in bleached plumage. At 
the same time it presents many differences from the bird which I 
have considered to be the adult, viz. in the breadth and purity of the 
white margins of the back-feathers, in the pure white primary coverts 
which are not freckled, but show five narrow brown cross bars, and 
especially in the total absence of any subterminal bar on the tail-
feathers. The latter are ochraceous buff, with narrow greyish brown 
bars on the inner webs, broader and more vermiculated on the 
outer; the two centre feathers entirely covered with ashy-brown 
frecklings.

Young male. Distinguished from the adult female by the length of 
the wing, which does not reach 14 inches in length. Brown, like the 
latter, but always more rufous, especially underneath and about the 
head and neck; facial ruff clear fulvous, streaked with dark brown; 
feathers above, around, and below the eye pure white, forming a very 
conspicuous facial patch; under surface of body tawny rufous, with 
dark brown streaks, narrower towards the abdomen; upper tail-coverts 
white, with mesial streaks of rufous brown; tail tawny rufous, fulvous 
at tip, with four broad cross bands of black• the interspaces 
ashy on the two central feathers only. 

Adult male. Above clear bluish ash-colour, paler and more silver? 
grey on greater wing-coverts, which are also slightly margined with 
whitish; below clear bluish ashy as far as the lower breast; the 
rest of the under surface pure white, including the under wing-
coverts and axillary plumes; frontal plumes and lores whitish, the 
facial ruff also slightly mottled with white; secondary quills silvery 
grey with black shafts and an indistinct blackish subterminal band, 
much more distinct below; the primaries blackish both above and 
below, white at base of inner web; upper tail-coverts white; tail 
ashy grey, tipped with white; the four centre feathers entirely uniform, 
with white shafts, the others more and more white on inner 
web? and having more or less remains of ashy bars; cere yellow; 
bill bluish black; feet yellow; claws black; iris yellow. Total 
length 22 inches, culmen 1*15, wing 13*6-13*8, tail 8*5-9*0; tarsus 
2*9. 

Adult female. Above brown; the feathers of the crown slightly 
washed with rufous, with which colour the feathers are margined; 
the nape and hind neck pale tawny fulvous, broadly streaked with 
dark brown; scapulars and wing-coverts spotted with large oval 
marks of pale tawny buff; quills brown, tipped with whitish; the 
secondaries externally washed with ashy grey, barred with blackish 

FALCOJSTD^J. 

brown, showing more plainly on under surface, wMch is ashy white, 

washed with rufous on inner web; upper tail-coverts white; tail 

greyish brown, tipped with whitish, crossed with five bands of darker 

brown, the subterminal one much broader; the interspaces on the 

outer feathers pale creamy buff, more or less shaded with ashy on 

outer Web; frontal feathers and plumes above and below the eye 

whitish; ear-coverts and cheeks rufous, streaked with dark brown; 

facial ruff buffy white, streaked with brown; sides of neck and under 

surface of body pale tawny buff, inclining to whitish on lower breast 

and abdomen, broadly streaked with brown, rather more narrowly 

on abdomen and thighs, where the streaks are washed with rufous; 

under wing-coverts coloured like the back; flanks and axillaries 

dark brown, spotted on both webs with rounded spots of creamy 

buff; cere greenish yellow; bill blackish; feet yellow; iris reddish 

brown. Total length 21-5 inches, wing 15*0-15*8, tail 10*5-11*0, 

tarsus 3*15. 

Obs. By the rufous bars on the tail a young female can be distin


guished from an old bird. In both sexes the streaks on the breast 

become narrower with age, though the females of English birds are 

more broadly streaked below, and are darker than those from 

Europe or India. The males are supposed to breed in the brown 

plumage, and do not get the blue dress till the second autumn, when 

it is assumed by a moult.

FALC0NID-2E. 

wing-coverts, bright brick-red; facial raff pale bluish grey; quills 
bluish grey, the primaries browner at tip and on inner web, the

has more grey on the crown than the others, and the facial ruff below 
the throat is spotted with white. The breast has less ashy grey 
than usual; and the white spots are of large size, and continued all 
over the chest. The bars on the tail vary, probably with age, some 
specimens not having more than six.

* Supposing that all the grey-plumaged birds are males, as is always stated, 
the wing varies from 13-5 to 15*5, which is the length of the brown-plumaged

semble the old male, though taking perhaps a longer time to gain the adult

white with narrow streaks of dark brown, the hinder margin of ear-
coverts nearly uniform brown; under surface of body creamy buff, 
the breast longitudinally streaked with brown; the abdomen and

reason of the fulvous margins to the feathers; under wing-coverts 
and axillaries uniform buffy white, the latter with a narrow longitudinal 
shaft-line of brown; cere greenish yellow; bill blackish; 
feet yellow, claws black; iris bright yeEow. Total length 22-5

It is probably owing to the difficulty of consulting Lesson's portion of the 
{ Complements de Buffon' that this bird has always been referred to a supposed 
genus Urubithiga of that author. On looking at vol. vii. (p. G4) it will be seen 
that he speaks of " Les Urubitinga," but by no means intends the worn in a 
gener o sense. Craiirex of G-ould is founded on the "Buzzard of the Galapagos, 
which is one of the large-billed Buteone^ of the B. erythwio+vs group {vide 
infra). Although by most Anivican authors placed alon« with the Pofyborf, 
the type of this new genus appears to me closer to A&tur, and to replace 
Melierax in the New World.

robust feet and bill, the former being yellow ; the colour of the back 
darker; shoulder-feathers coloured like the back; the outer webs 
of the first tail-feather banded six or seven times; the tips of the 
lateral tail-feathers much more narrowly white; the moustachial 
region, as well as the region of the eye and the ear-coverts, uniform 
with the crown; cere and iris pale yellow. Total length of male 
scarcely 15 inches; hill from front 1*25, from gape 1*3, height of bill 
8*5 (?1*5); wing 12; tail 7*5, middle toe and claw 2*4, hind toe 
and claw 1*7; tarsus 3*2 (French) inches. (Von Heugl'm.) 

Fab. White Me. 
This seems to me a very doubtful species, the characters brought 
forward by Dr. von Heuglin appearing to me to be characteristic of 
an old bird of M. polyzonus. The difference in the proportions of 
the two birds may ultimately turn out to be of importance; but I 
see no clearly distinguishing character at present.

Obs. Professor Schlegel, in his late i Revue' (7. c), separates A. 
uudvUventer from A. tachiro, uniting to the former the West-African 

A. zoaarhts (vel macroseelides). I cannot separate the North-east-
African bird from the true A. tachiro; but those from the Gold 
Coast are always much brighter blue above and more uniform 
rufous on the sides of the body, while those from Gaboon form a 
still more intensified race.

Young. Above bright ferruginous red, the head and hind neck 
streaked with blackish, the wings entirely rufous, the shafts of the 
quills above black, and the primaries barred with black on the Inner 
web near the base; upper tail-coverts and tail black, the latter 
largely spotted with white, as in the adult, the two outer feathers 
more or less bright red, barred with black, which is overspreading 
the whole feather, showing that the change of colour in the tail is 
gradually assumed without a moult; sides of the face rufous brown, 
streaked with black, the lores buff; under surface of body bufTy 
white, the throat narrowly, the breast more broadly streaked with 
dark brown, somewhat tinged with rufous; the abdomen, thighs, 
and under tail-coverts rich buff, unstriped; under wing-coverts 
yellowish buff, also extending over the base of the quills. 

Another young specimen in Mr. "Wallace's collection has the throat 
and breast thickly streaked with black, which also extends over the 
head, and gives a mottled appearance to the interseapulary region. 
This bird also shows the gradual spreading of the black on the red 
tail, a most anomalous change of plumage, as the tail-feathers are 
generally changed by a direct moult in the Birds of Prey. 

Adult male. Above blackish slate-colour, inclining to clear bluish 
grey on the head and neck, and to pale cinereous on the sides of 
the face; throat white, washed with greyish; remainder of under 
surface clear vinous salmon-colour, the lower abdomen, thighs, and 
under wing- and tail-coverts pure white ; quills slaty black, white 
at base of inner web, with some bars of blackish on the under 
surface; tail slaty black, slightly tipped with white, and crossed 
underneath with two bars of white, this being confined to the inner 
web; cere above the nostrils and bill black; orbits orange-yellow; feet 
deep orange-yellow; iris chrome-yellow. Total length 11*5 inches,

Ob$. Mr. Wallace was quite right, in my opinion, to separate this 
bird, which "is a large edition of A. hiogaster. It is, however, not 
strictly allied to that bird as regards its wings, which are distinctly 
barred on the under surface. Independently of its uniform appearance 
above, and the want of the rufous nape-band, it can always be 
told from A. griseogularis by its much shorter middle toe, which 
measures only 1-3-1*4 inch without ftie claw against 1*65-1*7 inch 
in the other species (females measured).

Hah. The hilly parts of India and Ceylon, not extending into the 
North-west Provinces. Sumatra, Java, Southern Borneo, Philippine

throughout the Indo-Chinese region, but not yet known further 
eastward than Assam. 

Ohs. The specimens from Nepal are much larger, and may prove 
to be a distinct race, in which case they will bear the name of Astur 
indicus. Professor Schlegel has already drawn attention to this 
large form (' Astures/ p. 22, note), which he calls A. trivirgatus 
indicus* The Museum specimens are, unfortunately, not sexed, so 
that the exact comparison of the sexes cannot at present be instituted. 
They measure in the wing 10*6 inches. The Ceylonese 
bird appears to agree with the Malayan form; and Mr. Swinhoe 
says the same of the Foxmosan examples.

white, the head tinged with dull vinous rufous, more distinct on the 
eyebrow, and occupying the whole of the sides of the face and neck; 
wing-coverts a little darker than the back; quills brown, barred 
with darker brown, the secondaries uniform with the back, the bars 
more distinct on the underside of the quills, where the inner web 
is ochraceous buff; tail-feathers brown, slightly rufescent on their 
margins, crossed with six bands of dark brown, the subterminal 
one rather broader; under surface of body white, slightly tinged 
with rufous, and having a narrow line of dark brown down the 
centre of the throat; remainder of under surface white, thickly 
barred with rufous, the bars becoming narrower on the flanks; 
thighs pale rufous buff, with narrow rufous bars; under tail-coverts 
white; under wing-coverts pale rufous buff, the axillaries whitish 
with remains of rufous cross bars. Total length 10*7 inches, culmen

Obs. This species may easily be confounded with the young of A. 
francescce in barred plumage; but the male of the latter, when it 
approaches the present species, has the remains of rufous edgings 
above, showing that it is a young bird. The full-grown female of 

A. francescce, when it has a bared under surface and no remains of 
rufous margins above,* can be distinguished from A. brutus by its 
grey cheeks and by the absence of any rufous shade on the neck. 
A. bruins may almost always be told by its rufescent thighs.

Adult (?). Above dark blackish brown, with narrow and almost 
obsolete rufous edgings to the feathers; quills blackish brown, with 
the same obsolete rufous edgings; under surface of wing much 
lighter and inclining to pale rufous, with very distinct black cross 
bars and tips to the feathers; tail very dark brown, barred across 
with blackish brown and pale rufous, the outer feathers quite plain, 
and all the tail-feathers tipped with pale rufous; throat white; rest 
of under surface of body rust-colour, lighter and more inclining to 
white down the centre of the body, the flanks very distinctly marked 
with diamond-shaped spots of blackish brown; legs deep rustcolour, 
with indistinct black transverse bars; under wing-coverts 

pale rust-colour, with a few blackish spots on the lower feathers 
and axillary plumes; bill black, yellowish at gape and at base of

Obs. There can be no doubt that Mr. Guraey and I were wron^ 
in determining the bird here described to be the young of A. JiarU 
lanbi. Although bearing great resemblance in immature plumage, 
1 have since determined that A. hartlaubi is a true Sparrow-Hawk; 
and Mr. Stevenson, who kindly measured the type in the Norwich 
Museum for^me, has convinced me that it is also a member of the 
genus Accipiter, whereas the bird in question is a veritable Goshawk, 
and agrees sufficiently well with A. tibialis to warrant its being 
referred to that species. 

15. Astur badius. 
This species includes five races or subspecies, which, although 
recognizable to the experienced eye, yet present so many closely 
allied characters, that no certain distinction can be drawn between 
them.

fresh feathers on the back, which are also grey. The markings on 
the breast-feathers are altering in shape and turning to bars, 
while at tho same time the stage of plumage is becoming perfected 
by the shooting of new feathers, as is usual in this section of the 
genus. 

Adult male. Above delicate bluish grey or dove-colour, the wings 
and tail uniform with the back, the primaries only a little darker and 
more blackish; the under surface of both quills and tail pale ashy, 
almost white; hinder part of neck delicate vinous; sides of face ashy 
grey like the head, but a little paler; throat white ; rest of under 
surface very pale vinous, lighter towards the abdomen and thighs and 
under tail-coverts ; under wing-coverts white. Total length 13-5 
inches, culmen 0*85, wing 8*1, tail 0*1, tarsus 2*2. 

Adult femah. Similar to the male, but larger and more slateeoloured; 
tho neck-collar and the under surface deeper vinous. Total 
length 16*5 inches, wing 9*(J, tail 7*1, tarsus 2*0.

Adult male. Similar to the female, but smaller. Total length 
17 inches, culmen 1%5, wing 9*9, tail 8-25, tarsus 2-5. 

Obs. The beautiful series of this species brought home by Mr. 
Wallace enables us to see how the different changes from the young 
plumage to the old are brought about. In the first stage the young 
bird resembles other Goshawks, being streaked on the chest, barred 
on the breast; but in its changes it closely follows the example of the 
small Mlcronisi, of which this group of Hawks seem to be distant 
relations. Both above and below the plumage is changed partially 
by a moult and partially by an absolute change of feather. Many 
new plumes appear on the breast, showing that the next dress will 
be of a vinous red colour with whitish cross bars. At the same time 
it appears that, after the manner of Sparrowhawks and Goshawks, 
some of the oval drops on the chest break up into bars, which are 
darker and not of so clear a rufous colour as the fresh-moulted feathers. 
"While these changes take place below, a slight shade of vinous 
begins to appear on the hind neck, which, however, never shows very 
clearly till the bird is quite old; and as this character increases in 

124 FALCG3STD.E. 

intensity with, age, Mr. Wallace's Acclpiter muelleri, being fully 
adult, could not possibly be a specimen of A. griseigitlaris which has 
" lost the nape-band/7 as Professor Kaup suggests.

the female of Aceipiter drrlwcephaliis by its long tail, which measures 
8 to 8*5 in the former, whereas the length of the latter never 
exceeds 7*2 or 7*3 inches. Along with this character will be found 
the slender middle toe of the Aceipiter.

* ASTUR, sp. 
Mr. Wallace's collection has a young bird from IJomboek, which I cannot 

identify. From its rufous coloration it seems to belong to the A, trinotatus 

group. 

Young. Above rufous, the feathers creamy white at their bases, barred and 
centred with ashy brown; nape slightly streaked with creamy buff; sides of 
face and neck entirely rufous, streaked with ashy brown, with faint indications 
of a buff eyebrow; win g-coverts ashy brown, with broad rufous .margins; quills 
ashy brown, narrowly margined and tipped with rufous, barred with darker 
brown, more plainly seen on the under surface, which is pale rufous at base of 
inner web, ashy grey towards the tips; tail ashy brown, tipped with pale brown, 
washed externally with rufous, crossed with ten narrow bars of darker brown 
more distinct on the under surface, the feathers being pale rufous at base of 
inner web; under surface of body creamy buff; the throat with a broad central 
line of greyish brown, the entire'breast streaked with longitudinal markings of 
brown, the under tail-coverts whitish with rufous-brown spots; thighs pale 
fawn-colour, spotted and barred with clear rufous; under wing-coverts buffy 
fawn-colour, streaked with rufous brown; cere pale yellow; bill black; feet 
pale yellow; iris olive. Total length 16 inches, culmen 1, wing 8*9, tail 7*3, 
tarsus 1-35. 

This may be the young of Astur wallacii; but the bird from Bouru is what I 
consider to be really the young of that species.

ings of dark brown, the lower breast barred with rufous brown, the 
bars becoming wider apart on the abdomen and under tail-coverts, 
and more distinctly rufous on the thighs; quills brown, numerously 
barred with darker brown on the inner webs, becoming obsolete on 
the bases of the latter, which are pale rufous underneath; tail brown, 
crossed with about eighteen bars of darker brown, the under surface 
lighter and ashy white in colour. Total length 18*5 inches, oilmen 
1*15, wing 10*4, tail 8-B, tarsus 2*7. 

The young bird described has been considered to belong to A. 
torquatus by llr. "Wallace; but its fades certainly refers it to a 
species allied to A. approooimans, as does also the sequence of change 
in its progress towards maturity, of which evidences are beginning 
to appear in the Bouru specimen. I think that there can be little 
doubt of its being the young of A. walladi.

* The present species will be found fully treated of in Part ix. of Sharpe and 
Dresser's 'Birds of Europe.' There I was inclined to consider Mr. Hume's 
Accipiter melanoschistus a good species; but a further experience of Accipitrine 
birds induces me to,think that it may be only a dark race of the ordinary 
Sparrow-Hawk. I say this under reserve, as I nave not yet seen a specimen 
labelled by Mr. Hume himself, and only judge by examples in the British Museum 
and Lord Walden's collection. At present, also, I believe Hodgson's A. 
bubtypims to be only a common Sparrow-Hawk. Should Mr. Hume's bird be 
distinct, the synonymy will be as follows:—

I have never seen this species, which will probably prove on examination to 
be identical with the small, richly coloured form of A. cooperi called by Swain-
son A. mcceicanus. 

138 PALC0NID-2J. 

upper tail-coverts inclining to ashy, broadly tipped with rufous, the 
lower ones with, white, with, which, also many of them are spotted; 
under surface of body dull rufous, inclining to white on the throat, 
belly, and under tail-coverts * the throat narrowly streaked with 
black, the breast more broadly, and the flanks and thighs with large 
bars or spade-shaped spots; under tail-coverts white, with longitudinal 
black streaks- under wing-coverts rufous, with black streaks 
widening out into bars on the lower series. 

Ohs. The " brown-and-white" dress, as the next plumage may 
be called, is the one in which the young A. cooperi generally appears 
in museums. It is apparently gained without a moult from 
the first stage by the rufous margins on the upper surface becoming 
paler, and the white bases to the feathers becoming so extended that 
the hind head and neck as well as the side face become streaked 
with white. The dark centres to the feathers of the nape have a 
tendency to narrow* so that this part also has a very streaked appearance. 
On the breast the streaks become narrower by degrees, 
those on the sides of the body being still a little the broadest, the 
bars on the flanks dissolving and leaving these parts more or less 
distinctly streaked. Under tail-coverts pure white; throat generally 
streaked with black, but this character is so variable that sometimes 
the throat is quite white, with only a few hair-like lines. These 
are probably birds which have been hatched out earlier, and in 

whom the characteristic development of a streaked plumage has 
more chance of being perfected. The adult plumage must be gained 
by a moult. 

Adult male. Above bluish slate-colour, the head darker and the 
wing-coverts also a shade deeper grey than the back, th.e shaft-
stripes distinct on upper surface; lores and eyebrow whitish; cheeks 
ashy with a slight rufous tinge, and narrowly lined with black; quills 
brown, externally shaded with slaty, the secondaries grey Eke the 
back, all barred with darker brown, more distinct below, where the 
under surface is whitish ashy• upper tail-coverts tipped with white; 
tail bluish slate-colour, with a broad white tip and crossed with 
three bars of greyish black- the lower surface greyish white; throat 
white, streaked with narrow blackish shaft-lines and tinged with 
rufous on lower part; rest of under surface clear rufous, spotted on 
both webs or else barred with white, the upper breast more or less 
uniform rufous; under wing-coverts rufous white, the upper ones 
streaked, the lower ones spotted with rufous; under taii-coverts 
white. Total length 15*5 inches, culmen 1-05, wing 0*3, tail 7'9, 
tarsus 2*7, middle toe 1*5. 

Adult female. Similar to the male, but larger. Total length 17*5

142 FJLLCOSIDJE. 

Young. Brown above, with, rufous edgings to the feathers; the 

nape and hind neck mottled with white, and strongly washed with 

rufous ; sides of the face dusky brown; the fore part of the cheeks

Ohs. The present species follows the rule of most other Sparrow-

Hawks in the changes of plumage characteristic of the progress to 

maturity, the longitudinal spots gradually dissolving and widening 

out into bars, as I have shown to be the case in the common A. 

nisus (cf. P. Z. S. 1873, p. 418).

the secondaries entirely ashy grey, like the back ; all the quills very 
numerously banded with dark ashy brown, more distinct underneath, 
where the interspaces are whitish; tail-feathers brown, strongly 
shaded with bluish ashy on the upper surface, which is almost 
entirely uniform; the under surface paler and more whitish ashy, 
with very numerous bars of dark brown on the inner web ; throat 
bufry white, with remains of ashy transverse markings; rest of 
under surface broadly barred with vinous red and ashy white ; the 
ashy shade on the cross bars more distinct on the flanks; the thighs 
very thickly barred, but the abdomen and under tail-coverts less 
numerously than the breast; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
coloured like the breast; cere and gape yellowish green ; bill black, 
lead-coloured at base ; feet yellow, slightly tinged with green ; iris 
yellow. Total length 12-3 inches, erdmen 0-8, wing 8-3, tail 6*4,

Young. Above brown, the feathers margined with rufous or 
rufous ochre, the crown blackish brown, the nape mixed with 
white and the scapulars and upper tail-coverts with concealed white 
spots; over the eye a streak of white narrowly lined with dark 
brown; sides of the face and neck white, streaked with dark brown, 
the latter washed with rufous; ear-coverts pale brown, darker on 
their hinder margin; under surface of body white, the throat with 
a distinct line of blackish down the centre, the chest streaked with 
dark brown in the centre and with pale rufous on the sides, the 
breast and abdomen marked with heart-shaped spots of pale rufous, 
developing into bars on the thighs; under tail-coverts white; under 
wing-coverts buiry white, the lesser ones streaked, the greater ones 
spotted with dark brown; quills brown, the secondaries margined 
with rufous ochre, barred with darker brown, more distinct 'underneath, 
where the feathers are bnffy white, shading into ashy brown 
at the tips; tail ashy brown, tipped with whitish and crossed with 
four bands of darker brown, the under surface ashy white, all the 
bars very plain, the outer tail-feather having seven. 

O65. By the gradual spreading of the streaks until they assume 
the form of bands, the next plumage is very different from the 
young stage just described, especially as the light rufous streaks on 
the side of the chest merge entirely, and present a thoroughly uniform 
appearance, as do also the sides of the face and neck. Erom 
this stage the under surface gradually becomes uniform bright 
rufous without any change of feather, the white interspaces on the 
breast gradually disappearing. This seems to be the usual mode of 

* I haye'examined the type in the Berlin Museum. 
152 yixco3srn>js. 

procedure in the female; but the male would appear to gain his 
adult dress without the intervening varied stage just noticed. 
Judging from a specimen collected in Eastern Timor by Mr. "Wallace, 
the plumage no sooner widens out from stripes to bars than they at 
once merge, and the bird becomes rufous underneath very rapidly. 

Adult male. Above deep blackish slate-colour, the nape slightly 
mottled with white, the crown and wing-eoverts a little darker; 
quills dark brown, shaded with slate-colour, without any bars above, 
the under surfaee paler and more ashy, inclining to pale rufous near 
the base of inner web, with blackish cross bars; tail ashy grey above, 
whitish ashy beneath, paler at tip, and crossed with three bars of 
slaty black; ear-coverts and sides of neck slaty grey, the latter 
washed with rufous; fore part of cheeks and throat buiry white, 
with a few indistinct blackish shaft-lines here and there; rest of 
under surface bright vinous chestnut, much paler on the thighs; 
abdomen and under tail-coverts white; under wing-eoverts rich 
ochre, the lower ones and the axillaries irregularly barred with 
brownish; cere yellow; bill black, lead-colour at base; feet pale 
orange-yellow; iris yellow. Total length 11 inches, culm en 0*75, 
wing 6-6, tail 5*1, tarsus 1*9.

* I have done my utmost to secure the exact; relative dimensions of these two 
bones; but the scantiness of osteological material renders positive identification 
in many cases impossible. At any rate the probability that some genera placed 
by me among the Buteoninffi may some day be found to belong to the Aecipitrinae 
only proves the truth of Professor SundevalFs remark that the two subfamilies 
are hardly separable (Av. Tent. p. 107). 
f One genus remains still unknown to me, Onychotes of Eidgway (Pr. Phil. 

Acad. 1870, p. 142):— 

" Nostril nearly circular, with a conspicuous (not central) tubercle. Tarsus 

very long and slender; toes moderate; claws very long, strong, and sharp, but 

only slightly curved. Tibial feathers short, close, not reaching below the joint. 

Wing very short, much rounded and very concave beneath; 4th quill longest, 

1st shorter than 9th. Tail moderate, rounded." 

Type 0. grueberi, Eidgway, I. c. 

Bab. 
California [?]. 

Mr. Eidgway has privately communicated to me the following additional 

details in answer to my inquiries:—" The posterior face of the tarsus has a row 

of transverse scutelks, as in. Buteo. The tarsus is longer than the distance from 

the ends of the secondaries to the tip of the primaries. The tips of the pri


maries reach to about the middle of the tail, which, however, is comparatively 

short; they fall short of the end of the tail by about the length of the tarsus. 

The nostrils are nearly round* they are not overhung by any perceptible mem


brane, though the upper part of the nasal aperture is filled by the tumid sMn of 

the cere, much as in Buteo &c. The soles of the feet are as m Buteo. The 

distance from ends of secondaries to tips of primaries is 2*50 inches. Length 

of tarsus 2*70 inches, middle toe 1*45, hind toe O80." 

From a comparison of these details with the above table it will be seen that 
Onychotes is closely allied to, if not identical with, Urubitinga.

Young. Dusky black above, the tail with two or three white bars 
near base in addition to the median and terminal bands; crown 
blackish, the feathers obscurely notched and barred with rufous; 
hind neck and underparts pale rufous, thickly barred with dusky 
black; least wing-coverts bright rufous, centred and barred with 
blackish, rest of the wing-coverts dusky black like the back, mottled 
with pale rufous near tips; quills much as in adult, but having remains 
of black bars across the rufous basal portion. 

The progress to the adult plumage appears to proceed by a gradual 
change of feather, the bars on the lower surface narrowing and 
gradually becoming obsolete. The dusky black on the dorsal feathers 
becomes much broken into zigzag bars; and the rufous spreads towards 
the shaft of the feather, but is once more confined to the 
margin when the slaty grey shade of the adult plumage commences 
to occupy the centre of the feather. 

Adult Head rufous, the lores whitish, ear-coverts and sides of 
face light ashy grey; back and scapulars pale slaty grey, all the 
feathers margined with rufous; lower back, rump, and upper tail-
coverts blackish, the latter glossed with purple and tipped with 
white; least wing-coverts bright rufous, the remainder pale slaty 
with broad rufous tips, the median ones also margined with rufous ; 
quills rufous, primaries black towards tip, secondaries with a broad 
subterminal band of purplish brown, the innermost entirely of the 
latter colour; tail purplish black, mottled and washed with rufous 
^near the base, broadly tipped with white and banded across the 
middle with* a distinct white bar; under surface of body rufous, the 
entire breast covered with obsolete remains of narrow blackish bars; 
thighs and under wing- and tail-eoverts uniform bright rufous. 

Total length 20 inches, culmen 1*55, wing 16-5, tail 8*3, tarsus 4*15. 

Adult female. Larger than male. Total length r24 inches, wing

Nestling, Covered with white down, the shooting feathers ashy 
brown, washed with rufous. 

Young, in change* Ashy brown above, the feathers paler and more 
whity brown on their margins, the scapulars, as well as many 
feathers of the head, neck, and interscapulary region, externally inclining 
to bright fawn; feathers of hind neck dark brown, some of 
the dorsal feathers black; quills black, externally shaded with ashy, 
the secondaries paler brown, all white at base of inner web, the 
secondaries barred towards the tip with ashy brown; tail ashy 
brown, washed on outer web with rufous, and crossed with eleven 
or twelve bars of blackish brown, disappearing towards base* sides 
of face and throat rather dusky brown, inclining to blackish; rest of 
under surface bright fawn, the flanks and thighs slightly washed with 
greyish ashy; under wing-coverts rufous fawn, the lower ones dark 
brown; on breast a few white feathers, more or less mixed with 
black, are appearing. 

The adult plumage is apparently gained by a moult, which, however, 
does not immediately complete the full dress, as the fresh 
feathers on the under surface have a good deal of rufous on them, 
and then rapidly change to black. The brown cross bars on the tail 
disappear by degrees, foreshowing the uniformity of the new tail, 
which, when put on by a moult, is clear chestnut, excepting a subterminal 
patch of black, scarcely to be called a bar. The uniform 
character of the thighs with the re&t of the under surface, and then-
rapid change to black, along with the breast-feathers, is a character 
unlike B. vulgaris and B. desertomm. 

Adult male. Every where sooty black; tail chestnut-red, with a 
black subterminal band; centre of chest whitish or rafous white, 
more or less mottled with black, being the remains of immaturity, 
as also are the white edgings to the feathers of the abdomen and 
thighs, and rufous on the under tail-coverts; quills black, primaries 
externally ashy grey, secondaries whitish, both conspicuously barred 
with black; under surface of wing white, the secondaries barred 
with blackish on the inner web, and crossed with a broad black 
subterminal band; primaries black at tip ; lores whitish; cere 
yellow; bill black, whitish at base ; feet yellow; iris ochraceous 
grey. Total length 21 inches, culmen 1-85, wing 17, tail 8, 
tarsus 3*3.

I have not yet seen this species, and, therefore, have not been able to place it 
in my synoptic table. Eull descriptions are given by Count Salvador* and Prof. 
Barboza duBocage; and the following remarks by Dr. Otto Finsch will give a 
good idea of its relations to B. augur:— 

" In any case this species, although allied to JB. augur, is well distinguished, 
not only by its inferior size, but also by the very different coloration. The crop 
and breast are dark red-brown, the remaining underparts white, with conspicuous 
dark cordiform spots ; under tail-coverts and thighs uniform white; the greater 
portion of the inner web of the secondaries is white, with five or six narrow, incomplete, 
dark cross bands, whereas in B. augur iheve are from nine to eleven 
complete dark cross bands." 

176 FALOONID-E. 

black bars; Tinder -wing-coverts white, as also the inner web of the 

quills; cere and feet yellow; iris yellowish brown. 

In the foregoing stage, which does not occur in the allied Buteo 
jalcal, the under tail-coverts always incline more or less to rufous, 
which sometimes extends halfway up these coverts. Although, 
through the progress to maturity, the plumages are so different, yet 
in the fully adult black dress it is almost impossible to distinguish 
the present bird from B. jacal; and the only difference that I can 
see is, that in the latter species the silvery grey on the wing 
is lighter, while the tail is darker and more decided chestnut. The 
black markings on the latter never reach quite to the end, but are 
always subterminal, and form a more or less perfect band. 

Old male. Black, the base of the quills externally ashy grey with 
black bars; the tail rufous, with black markings near the tip. 
Total length 20 inches, culmen 1*55, wing 10*3, tail 7*5, tarsus 
3*6. 

Old female. Similar to the male, but a little larger. Total length 
24-5 inches, wing 18*75, tail 9, tarsus 3*6.

Young. Above rufous, tlie feathers centred with brown, forming 
narrowly longitudinal streaks on the head and hind neck, which are 
paler and more fulvous than the rest of the hack; small wing-coverts 
tawny rufous, with narrow brown central streaks, the rest of the 
wing-coverts pale brown, margined and barred on the outer web 
with pale rufous, the inner web whitish; primaries dark brown, 
shaded with ashy grey on the outer web, which is indistinctly 
barred with dark brown, and washed with rufous near the base; 
secondaries rather paler brown, tipped with buffy white and barred 
on the inner web with dark brown like the primaries, the inner 
lining of the quills pure white, the secondaries only showing remains 
of bars on inner web; lower back and rump darker brown 
than the upper part, notched and margined with rufous; upper tail-
coverts bufly white on outer web, rufous on inner, with dark brown 
shaft-stripes and remains of brownish bars; tail ashy brown, tipped 
with fulvous and shaded with ashy grey, inclining to rufous near 
the tip, all the feathers whitish at base and on the inner web, and 
having more or less distinct remains of brown cross bars; sides of 
face and underparts creamy buff, streaked with dark brown, those 
on the cheeks a little broader and showing a tolerably defined moustachial 
line; the lower flank-feathers more largely marked with 
rufous brown, which occupies the greater part of the feather; thighs 
strongly tinged with rufous, the brown central streaks a little 
broader and more pronounced; under wing-coverts creamy buff, 
narrowly streaked with rufous brown, the outer ones entirely brown 
on the outer edges. 

The bird above described is manifestly quite young, from the pale 
and narrowly streaked character of the underparts; it was killed 
by Messrs. JDickson and Ross on the 3rd of August 1843. The 
under surface in this species darkens with age until the old bird 
arrives at the uniform sooty brown plumage, in which it is very rare 
in collections. The red tail cannot be regarded as a sign of actual 
immaturity; for the birds breed in this stage, and even then they 
seem to put on a rufous tail shaded with silvery grey before absolutely 
attaining the grey tail banded with dark brown which characterizes 
the last stage of this species. It would appear, therefore, 
that the different changes are very gradual, and occupy a long time. 

Adult male in breeding-plumage (Volga, May 1870). Above brown, 
all the feathers broadly margined with tawny rufous, except on the 
lower back and rump, where the feathers are uniform brown; entire 
head and neck tawny, with narrow brown streaks down the centres 
of the feathers, more distinct on the nape; sides of head and ear-
coverts whitish, with narrow rufous shaft-lines; entire under sur-

face rich tawny, deepening Into chestnut on the abdomen and thighs, 
the throat and chest narrowly shafted with dark brown, a little 
broader on the breast and decidedly more distinct on the thighs, 
where the centres to the feathers are also brown; nnder wing-coverts 
and axillaries rich tawny, the outer median ones externally and the 
greater coverts brown; upper wing-coverts brown, edged with rufous 
like back, the least ones more broadly; quills dark brown, the 
primaries externally shaded with silvery grey, the secondaries a 
little paler, especially the inner ones, which are light brown like 
the back, the primaries pure white for greater part of Inner web, 
secondaries mottled and broadly barred with brown; upper tail-
coverts brown, the external ones bright tawny; tail pale rufous, 
with white shafts, and inclining to whitish towards base of centre 
feathers, the two outer ones externally shaded with ashy grey, and 
marked near the end with an irregular spot of brown; cere yellowish 
green; orbita1 uge dusky greenish* bill brownish plumbeous, 
yellow at gape, tip black; feet dingy or pale lemon-yellow ; 
iris brownish yellow. Total length 26 inches, culmen 1*9, wing 
17*7, tail 10*5, tarsus 3*75. 

Adult female. Similar to the male, but slightly larger. Total 
length 26 inches, culmen 1*9, wing 18*4, tail 10*5, tarsus 3*5*. 

Prom this stage the bird gradually becomes more sooty, and in 
the last rufous plumage closely resembles B. deserterurn, espeeiaHy 
as the tail becomes ashy brown, tipped with rufous and slightly 
washed with the same, and crossed with nine or ten bands of darker 
brown, more conspicuous on Inner web, which is for the most part 
whitish. Capt. Shelley shot a specimen In this stage along with 
red-tailed birds in Egypt. 

Very old (type of B. aquilinvs, figured, PL Till.) . Everywhere 
dusky brown, the head and neck streaked with whitish, with which 
also the centre of the breast Is varied, the throat and chest slightly 
washed with rufous, all these characters being the remains of the 
previous plumage; tail ashy brown with white shafts, crossed with 
about nine bars of dark brown as above noted, these bars not 
always conterminous. Total length 27 inches, wing 18*3, tail 11, 
tarsus 3*5.

of the feathers of the lower breast tipped with creamy huff, the 
under tail-coverts inclining to this colour, as also the middle of the 
breast; the throat and chest narrowly streaked with dark brown ; 
the thighs and flanks more uniform rufous, somewhat shaded with 
ashy brown; under wing-coverts creamy buff, with rufous central 
streaks, the outermost and greater series inclining to ashy brown; 
upper wing-coverts dark brown, margined with rufous like the back;

Like the other Buzzards of the Old World, this species gradually 
gets darker with age, and the tail appears to alter to an almost 
uniform smoky brown, tipped with fulvous and washed with rufous, 
with indications of bars more or less distinct. The few examples 
examined from Northern Africa appear larger than others from India 
and Africa proper, and approach more nearly certain stages of Buteo 
ferox. The birds described are South- African examples, as being 
the typical birds.

15*4, tail 9, tarsus 3, bare part of tarsus in front 1*1 to the root of

Notwithstanding the opinion of Macgillivray and others that 

Buzzards get whiter as they grow older, my belief is that the con


trary is the case, though it must be remembered that Macgillivray's 

observations were made on British specimens, which are certainly 

darker than continental birds, and apparently so from the nest. 

"With regard to the present species I am nearly convinced that Buteo 

jplumijpes of Hodgson is nothing more than the fully mature bird of 

B. jagonicus. In the 'Fauna Japonica' the quite young bird, 
answering to the same stage of B. vulgaris, is figured (pi. vi. B) ; 
and on pi. vi. is an illustration of an older bird, showing the passage 
from the young stage to that which I have described as the adult. 
In this plumage it closely resembles B. deseriorum^ and may be 
doing duty for that species in some Indian collections. In the specimen 
described by me the fuliginous colouring of the back, flanks, 
and under wing-coverts shows the first approach to that uniform 
coloration which is supposed to be the characteristic of BuUo 
plumipes.

The types originally described were two in number; but more recently 
Prof. SchLegel (Revue, Z. c.) has referred the male to Buteo 
plumipes, and in this he is apparently right. I subjoin the description 
I made of this supposed male of B. Jiemilasius in the Leiden 
Museum:— 

Male. Altogether darker brown, apparently not so bleached; the 
eyebrow white and also the ear-coverts, causing the brown cheeks to 
stand out in bolder relief and appear like a broad moustachial streak; 
under surface of body white, the chest and entire thighs and under 
tail-coverts white, the throat narrowly and distinctly barred with 
dark brown, the streaks on the breast paler brown and less defined; 
flanks entirely brown; tail uniform brown, paler at the tip, with 
remains of darker brown cross bars; the under surface white, 
as also the base of the tail above, but not spreading on to the 
centre as in the female. Total length 20*5 inches, wing 10, tail 10, 
tarsus 2*9. 

B. Tiemilasius may be regarded as a gigantic edition of B.glumipes.

The case of the Peregrines appears to repeat itself here in the 
Red-tailed Buzzards of America, inasmuch as the western birds are 
different, being much larger, more powerful, and darker-plumaged 
than the eastern or ordinary specimens of B. borealis. The Museum 
contains a fine series; and if the whole of the plumages of B. borealis 
are represented (which is perhaps doubtful), the western bird 
must be specifically separated, or must at least rank as a subspecies.

with, rufous on their margins ; head and nape streaked with white, 
the latter more plainly; lores whitish; sides of face white, the 
ear-coverts streaked with dark brown; cheeks entirely brown, 
forming a distinct facial stripe; under surface of body white; 
throat with a mesial streak of dark brown, breast broadly streaked 
with the same, the markings on the flanks and thighs more oval in 
shape and tinged with rufous; under tail-coverts white; under 
wing-coverts white, with a few longitudinal spots of dark brown ;

As in most other Buzzards, the change from young to adult plumage 
is characterized by a darker and more uniform plumage beneath. 
This is acquired by a direct change of feather, the brown 
centres to the feathers widening out and occupying the greater part 
of the feather; and then, by the inroad of the white spots, a mottled 
appearance is produced on the breast and a barred plumage on the 
abdomen, where the white extends across the feathers. 

Adult female. Above brown; the nape mottled with bufly white ; 
the wings rather lighter than the back, the tips to the secondaries 
whitish, but otherwise coloured as in the young; outer upper tail-
coverts tipped with white; tail brown, tipped with brownish white, 
and crossed with two bands only of the same colour ; lores whitish ; 
sides of face rufous brown, streaked with blackish brown; the cheeks 
blackish ; throat buff, streaked with blackish brown; breast rufous 
brown, mottled with white spots of irregular shape on both webs 
of the feathers, taking the form of regular bars on the belly and 
flanks, which are barred with rufous and white, the thighs more 
narrowly and the under tail-coverts very sparingly; under wing-
coverts buff, with smaE rufous markings; cere and gape yellow; 
bill black, bluish at base; feet dirty orange-yellow; iris bright 
amber. Total length 16 inches, culmen 1*3, wing 11*4, tail 7, 
tarsus 2-6. 

Adult male. Similar to the female, but not quite so rufous, and 
smaller in size. Total length 15 inches, wing 10*7, tail 6*8, tarsus 
2-35.

Adult. Above ashy brown, the head much clearer and inclining 
to ashy grey; quills deep chestnut, inclining to brown at the tips, 
the exterior primaries brown on the outer web, the secondaries externally 
ashy brown, the innermost entirely of that colour, like the 
back, all the quills marked with narrow black bars, a little broader 
but more indistinct on the secondaries, the inner face of the wing 
pale creamy rufous, with slight indications of blackish bars; lower 
upper tail-coverts bufiy white, tinged with ochre, and barred with

pale rufous, decreasing in number and distinctness on the abdomen 
and under wing- and tail-coverts; the thighs fulvous, very thickly 
banded with pale rufous. Total length 14*5 inches, culmen 1*3, 
wing 9*2, tail fro, tarsus 2*4. 

Young. Above brown, some of the wing-eoverts margined with 
fulvous or pale rufous; forehead, crown of head, and hind neck, as 
well as the interseapulary region, varied with creamy white; a 
tolerably distinct eyebrow, cheeks, and ear-coverts creamy white, 
streaked with brown; quills brown, barred with bkcMsh, the 
secondaries tipped with dull white, the inner webs creamy buff at 
the base, slightly washed with rufous, the cross bars showing very 
plainly on the light ground; upper tail-coverts creamy buff, barred

Ohs. The next stage is very similar, being a little more uniform 

dark brown above, with few rufous edgings to the feathers: the 

markings on the breast are more rufous, and the bars on the inner 

face of the wing narrow, while a clearer shade of rufous is also 

here apparent; the throat streaked with ashy brown. The progress

towards maturity is marked by the gradual widening of the lon


gitudinal spots on the chest, with which a shade of ashy brown gra


dually mingles and overspreads the whole of the throat and chest• 

the rufous bars on the belly and thighs gradually become narrower, 

and the bars on the wing disappear by degrees, leaving the inner 

surface of the wing more or less uniformly rufous towards the base 

of the quills.

Young. Above brown; the dorsal feathers more or less margined 
and barred with rufous; the head streaked with deep ochre, of which 
colour there is also a distinct eyebrow; sides of face and under surface 
of body deep ochre; the upper margin of ear-coverts dark brown, 
and the sides of neck streaked with the same colour; the breast 
sparingly spotted with dark brown, the spots diminishing in number 
towards the abdomen, and changing to bars on the thighs and 
under tail-coverts; under wing-coverts deep ochre, with blackish 
spots ; upper wing-coverts a little browner than the back and much 
mottled, with rufous margins to the greater series; primaries black, 
secondaries browner, barred with black, showing more plainly on 
the inner web, which is ochraceous in the primaries, rufous in the 
secondaries; upper tail-coverts ochraceous white, the middle ones 
blackish at base and along shaft; tail ashy brown, tipped with 
whity brown, crossed with eight or nine bars of darker brown, the 
subterminal one being the broadest. 

Obs. The bars on the tail dissolve into irregular mottlings, and are 
never quite conterminous on each side of the shaft. At the same 
time as the bird's plumage begins to get black by the gradual extension 
of the dark centres to the feathers, a new tail is assumed by 
a moult, the apical half of which is black, the basal half ashy brown, 
with numerous black mottlings (as in the preceding tail), but with 
the white of the adult plumage already appearing in a greater or less 
degree; the base of the tail is black at first, but this gradually disappears 
with age. 

Adult male. Entirely black; upper tail-coverts for the most part 
white, especially the external ones; tail white at base (generally 
with remains of black) and at tip, with a broad black band across 
the lower half. Total length 22-5 inches, culmen 2*25, wing 15*3, 
tail 9, tarsus 4*45. 

Adult female. A little larger than the male. Total length 25 
inches, wing 15*9, tail 10, tarsus 4*8.

Young. Above chocolate-brown, black on the head and interscapular 
region, which are both streaked with ochraceous buff, forming 
an eyebrow; the wing-coverts irregularly marked with rufous, 
especially on the greater series; primaries black; secondaries brown, 
like the back, all barred with blackish, more plainly on inner web, 
which is buff in the primaries, rufous in the secondaries; upper tail-
coverts black, washed with rufous, and barred with white or bufry 
white ; tail white at base, gradually inclining to brownish towards 
tip, which is white, the basal half with indications of six more or 
less complete black bands, and the apical half with two bands, the 
subterminal one broader and more brown in colour; sides of face 
and of neck ochraceous buff, strongly streaked with black; the upper 
margin of ear-coverts and cheeks entirely black; lores buff; under 
surface of body ochraceous buff, streaked with black, very minutely 
on throat and largely on sides of breast and flanks, the latter being 
almost uniform brownish black; thighs, abdomen, and under tail-
coverts barred across with black, less numerously on the latter; under 
wing-coverts ochraceous buff, with large heart-shaped spots of black* 

Obs. The change from the young to the adult dress being effected 
by a gradual spreading of the black centres to the feathers till all 
the ochre or buff coloration is absorbed, remains of this are seen in 
many adult birds, particularly on the sides of the face and under 
the wings. 

Adult male. Entirely black ; nape slightly varied with buffcoloured 
bases to the feathers; upper and under tail-coverts narrowly 
tipped with white ; quills black above and below; tail black, nar

* It is impossible to adopt the name of imttwrina for this species, as Daudin 
founded this title on LevaiUant's *' Caffre," which, in the exercise of charity, we 
may imagine to have been intended for the Black Eagle of South Africa"; but 
inasmuch as he omits all mention of the characteristic white back, and describes 
its habits most erroneously, we cannot allow his name to take precedence over 
Lesson's description, which is most exact. The following synonymy applies to 
Levaillant's species:—

* I cannot separate A. canadensis, the old birds of which appear to he indistinguishable. 
The young ones from America wear a peculiarly light plumage 
on the head and neck, and are of large size, though in this respect they are 
equalled by Himalayan specimens. Capt. Unwinds female bird, from Huzara, 
measures:—total length 40 inches, wing 27*9, tail 15, tarsus 4. These measurements, 
which are from the skin, somewhat surpass those of the bird when measured 
in the flesh. A North-American specimen measures:—total length

Young, Above rather light brown, the back-feathers mostly shaded 
down the middle with ashy and on the margins with purplish ; all 
the feathers of the upper surface pointed with buify fawn-colour, 
giving a spotted character to the plumage; head and neck tawny 
buff, the feathers with clear brown bases, which show through more 
or less, and impart a streaked appearance; the plumes of the hind 
neck long and lanceolate, brown, like back, with tawny streaks down 
the centre; wing-coverts brown, pointed with fulvous like the back; 
the greater and median coverts with broad whitish buff terminal 
spots, widening up the shafts of the feathers; quills blackish, the 
secondaries rather browner, and broadly tipped with whitish buff; 
feathers of hinder back and rump tawny fulvous,, with dark brown 
lateral margins, spreading more over the plames of the latter part; 
upper tail-coverts buffy white, in strong contrast to tail; tail uniform 
brown, tipped with buffy white ; under surface light tawny fulvous, 
nearly uniform on the throat, abdomen, thighs, leg-feathers, and 
under tail-coverts; the whole of the breast-feathers laterally margined 
with brown, producing a distinctly streaked appearance; under 
wing-coverts rufous fawn-colour, streaked with brown, the lower 
series ashy brown, like the inner lining of the wing; bill and feet 
as in adult. 

Obs. The change from the striped under surface to the adult seems 

""W i'l 

39 . AOJFILA. 239 
to be effected mostly by a gradual change in the coloration of the 
feather, by means of the spreading of the brown colour. At present 
I have seen no specimen in actual moult; yet it is very probable that 
a partial moult occurs, and that the new feathers, which are particoloured, 
gradually get entirely black. The Museum contains an 
example, in full progress towards the black dress, killed in the 
month of April, probably in the second year of the bird's age. 

Adult male. Blackish brown above, much Hghter brown on the 
upper part of the back and on the upper tail-coverts, which are 
mottled with white near the base, and broadly tipped with the same; 
many of the scapulars pure white, forming a conspicuous patch, 
which, however, is confined to the scapulars themselves; the least 
wing-coverts slightly mottled with brown, but not with white, near 
the carpal bend; rest of wing-coverts blackish brown, uniform with 
interscapulary region; quills blackish, the primaries externally 
shaded with ashy grey, the secondaries browner, the innermost 
slightly tipped with buffy white; the lower surface of wing ashy 
brown, the primaries mottled with whitish at base of inner web; tail 
ashy grey for a little more than the basal two thirds, shaded with 
silvery grey, and mottled with blackish brown, forming indistinct and 
broken bars on some of the feathers, the terminal third blackish 
brown, with a narrow tip of fulvous; head and neck light fulvous, 
with fawn-coloured bases to some of the nape-feathers ; feathers of 
hind neck dark fawn-brown, with light buff tips and dark brown 
centres ; forehead and anterior part of crown blackish, as well as 
the feathers over the eye* sides of face and of neck light fulvous like 
the crown, the feathers under the eyes inclining to brown• cheeks 
and entire underparts blackish, the under tail-coverts tawny buff, 
with dark-brown shaft-lines and whitish tips to the feathers; under 
wing-coverts and axillaries blackish, like the breast; cere pale 
yellow; bill bluish, darker at tip; feet pale yellow; iris brownish 
yellow. Total length 31 inches, culmen 2-6, wing 22-6, tail 11*3, 
tarsus 3*9. 

Adult female. A little larger than the male. Total length

* It is doubtful whether A. vindhiana should be considered more than a 
small race of A. rapax, the adult plumages being very similar, but the young 
apparently different. This, however, depends on the question whether we 
really know the young bird of A. vindhiana in Europe. Mr. W. E. Brooks Las 
written voluminous papers on the Eagle question, and has made some interesting 
identifications, one of the last of them being the existence of three species of 
the A. rapaso group, which he distinguishes as A. fulvescem, Gray, A. vindhiana, 
Frankl., and A. fzevioides, Cuv. The characters of these three exist in their 
rounded or vertical nostril and their plain or barred tail. On the strength of 
these points I cannot at present follow Mr. Brooks in distinguishing A. fulvescem 
from A. vindhiana, as I have seen specimens of the latter with an unbarred 
tail and yet possessing a vertical nostril, while I have also seen A. rapax 
from Africa with the same characters. [Cf. Brooks Ibis, 1874, p. 84.]

Aquila nsevia, Brooks, 8tr. F. i. p. 293 (1873). 

Of this species, to unite which with A. ncevia I cannot quite agree 
with Mr. Brooks, I subjoin the measurements of a pair sexed by 
that gentleman and sent to Mr. H. E. Dresser:— 

Adult S. Total length 23 inches, culmen 2S, wing 19-15, tail 
9-5, tarsus 3*9. 

Adult $ . Total length 24*5, wing 19-5, tail 10, tarsus 3*9. 

Although, as Mr. Brooks says, some examples are difficult, if not 
impossible, to tell from A. ncevia of Europe, I must coincide with 
Messrs. Garney and Dresser that the young are not quite the same; 
and I have never seen any adult European birds with the small white 
spots on the least wing-coverts, which frequently occur in A. hastata. 
This character appears to me to be probably a sign of the adult 
plumage, and may perhaps present a character of importance in 
distinguishing A. hastata from A* ncevia*

white, streaked with black, the lower ones entirely black, with white 
tips; axillaries white, barred and streaked with blackish, the remains 
apparently of a uniform blackish feather ; quills deep brown, 
much mottled with white on inner web; tail ashy brown, more or 
less inclining to grey, with five or six indistinct bars of brown near

1867, p. 315; Hume, Bough Notes, i. p. 203 (I860); Ball, Sir. F. i. p. 52 
(1873). 

Adult male. Head with the traces of a crest, and of a light brown colour, 
striped with dark brown ; each feather is, for the basal three fourths, white, and 
one fourth from the tip light brown, with a longitudinal dark brown stripe in 
the centre, which gives an appearance of light brown to the head; but on the 
feathers being in the slightest ruffled the head assumes an albescent appearance. 
Back, wings, and tail brown; but, from the greater portion of the base of each 
feather being white or light brown, the upper surface of the bird assumes a 
mottled appearance of brown and white, the brown being darkest in the centre 
of the back, quill-feathers, and tail. The greatest portion of the inner web of 
the quill-feathers is white, which gives a white appearance to the under surface 
of the wing, which is most striking when the bird is flying. The primaries are 
dark towards their points; but all the wing-feathers are more or less conspicuously 
banded with four or five dark brown bars. This is also the case with the 
feathers of the tail. All the under surface is white, streaked with longitudinal 
brown marks on the breast, flanks, and centre of abdomen. Some of the under 
wing-coverts have three or four dark brown bands; and immediately under the 
bend the feathers of the wing are streaked with rufous; this is also the case with 
the thighs and some of the lower tail-coverts and white feathers of the densely 
feathered tarsus. The toes are yellowish, with black claws; cere greenish slaty; 
bill dark blackish slaty; irides dark reddish brown. The two outermost lateral 
tail-feathers, when observed from beneath, have a very albescent appearance, 
with dark dots near the tips, and traces of spots of the same colour going towards 
the base. Total length 24 inches, bill along curve from edge of cere

SPIZAETUS SPHINX. 

Spizaetus sphynx, Hume, Str. F. i. p. 323 (1873). 

A single skin of a Spizaetus is in the Museum, with no history attached, which 
1 feel inclined to refer to S. sphhtx of Hume. It agrees exactly in description, but 
is, larger, being perhaps a female. I can hardly believe, however, that the bird 
can be separated from S. eirrhaivi; but perhaps I have not got Mr. Hume's 
actual species before me. The broad subterminal bar and preceding interspace 
occur in young Madras specimens, and in one immature bird from Nepal. 

SPIZAETUS PHILIPPINENSIS. 

Spizaetus philippensis, Gumeyi in Gould? $ B. Asia, pt. xv. (1863); Gray, 
Hand-l B. I p. 13 (1869). 

The general colour of the upper surface in this species is a dark umber-brown; 
but the base of the feathers of the crest is white, and the margins of the other 
occipital feathers are of a light yellowish brown. Some of the scapulars and 
other alar feathers (especially the latter) are slightly tipped with the same; the 
tail, which is of a somewhat lighter brown than the back, is tipped with a very 
narrow edging of white, and is also crossed by seven blackish brown bars, the 
upper one, however, being somewhat indistinct, and the two lower being separated 
by an interval which is twice the breadth of the spaces between the other 
bars. The throat has a broad blackish band running down the centre, with two 
similar and nearly parallel bands proceeding from the corners of the mouth, the 
three bands all merging in a cluster of dark-brown lanceolate marks upon the 
upper portion of tKe breast, the intervals between these markings, and also the 
whole sternal and abdominal regions, being tinged with a yellowish rufous; the 
under tail-coverts are barred with brown and white, the former bars being much 
broader than the latter; and the thighs and toes are marked throughout their 
length with narrow, equidistant, transverse bars of the same colour. Total 
length 25 inches, crest 2|, wing from carpal joint 14f, tail 111, tarsus 3|, middle 

toe and claw 3.

Similar in all respects to 8. cheela, but very much smaller, appearing 
to be a southern representative of that bird. A specimen from 
Hainan, one of the types of 8. rutherfordi, measures:—total length 
27 inches, wing 17*8, tail 11, tarsus 3*8. The colour is rather 
duller brown than in other Indian examples. With the above dimensions 
may be compared a bird from Murshedabad:—total length 
25 inches, wing 16*8, tail 10*8, tarsus 3-65. Mr. Hume gives the 
following measurements of his new Andaman species, 8. davisoni 
( $ ):—total length 24 inches, wing 15 inches; and I believe that 
a gradual gradation may be found. The uniform chest, which scfae 
naturalists think a distinguishing character, exists m fully adult 
birds of 8. cheela from the Himalayas. It is possible that 8. pal* 
lidus may some day be united as a further diminutive race of the 
southern form; but its extremely small size and pale coloration induce 
me at present to keep it distinct. 

Hab. Central and Southern India, Andaman Islands, and Ceylon, 
extending eastwards through the Indo-Chinese countries to 
Hainan.

With regard to the last specimen (m) I may state that I have also 
seen two adult specimens, both of which I was assured came direct 
from the Cape ; but of this fact I could not satisfy myself perfectly. 
Mr. Cassin has recorded this species under the name of H. blagrus (Pr. 
Phil. Acad. 1865, p. 4) from Gaboon; so that it seems probable that 
this or an allied Sea-Eagle remains to be discovered in Africa.

Total length 20 inches, oilmen 1*55, wing 14*7, tail 8-1, tarsus 2*1. 

Young. Above deep brown, the interscapulary feathers inclining 
to dull maroon towards their tips, the rest of the feathers of the 
upper surface tipped with rufous, and most of them externally 
shaded with ashy grey; head and neck pale rufous, with buffywhite 
centres and tips to the feathers, giving a streaked appearance, 
as in a young Milvus ; forehead, lores, and sides of face white, with 
narrow black shaft-lines to the feathers; the ear-coverts slightly 
washed with brown, their hinder margin distinctly brown; chin 
whitish; rest of under surface pale rufous brown, the shaft-stripes 
distinct, all the feathers with central streaks of buffy white, the 
chest-feathers darker, and washed with brown on both margins, 
thighs and under tail-coverts inclining to maroon; under wing-
coverts and axillaries clear brown, tipped with rufous or maroon,

As this species extends eastwards a variation takes place in the 
coloration of the head, neck, and breast, by reason of the marked 
attenuation of the black shaft-stripes to the feathers of these parts. 
The Javan bird has been separated as a species; but so gradual are 
the changes in this respect, and so thoroughly coincident with a 
change of locality, that I cannot allow full specific rank to either of 
the two subspecies mentioned below. Ear the sake of convenience, 
however, I keep their synonymy distinct. The Indian birds have 
the shaft-stripes strongly pronounced; but the birds from Siam, the 
Philippines, Malacca, Java, and Borneo have very narrow black 
shaft-lines, which diminish in intensity in the Timor specimens, are 
less distinct in Celebean examples (ef. SchL Mus. P.-B. Aqitilce, 

p. 20), and almost absent in those from Bourn. In all other islands 
of the Malayan archipelago they are entirely wanting, and the 
birds have white heads and breasts, as in the true U. girrenera of 
Australia. The latter are a little smaller, and have the young 
generally rather lighter in colour than in the typical H, Indus, 
Subsp. a. Haliastnr intermedins.

I regret that when in Berlin I did not more fully describe the 
type, from which, however, the measurements are taken. I fancied 
at the time that it was not distinct from one of the other two 
species; but I have not been able to reconcile it with either of them. 
The species of Rostlwamus are not well known, and their characters 
and geographical distribution still require working out with a good 
series.

Young. Above dark brown, the wing-coverts margined and externally 
spotted with rufous; forehead, eyebrow, and cheeks whitish, 
narrowly streaked with dark brown; crown slightly varied with 
rufous; hinder part of ear-coverts and sides of neck dark brown, 
the latter feathers margined with white, and looking as if streaked; 
quills dark brown, barred with black, the secondaries tipped with 
pale rufous, inner surface of quills white at the base, with more or 
less irregular bars of dark brown; rump, upper tail-coverts, and 
base of tail white * rest of tail dark brown, paler and more ashy 
underneath, tipped with pale brown; under surface of body whitish, 
the throat narrowly, the breast very broadly streaked with dark 
brown, the sides of chest and flanks entirely brown, scarcely at all 
varied with white; under wing-coverts and axillaries dark brown, 
margined and barred with rufous. 

Ohs. On comparing adults of B. leucojpygus with B. sociahilis in 
the Leiden Museum, I noted that the former is a much larger and 
blacker bird, and is further distinguished by having the base of tail 
and the terminal band on the same, as well as the upper and under 
tail-coverts, white. Young birds measured as follows:— $ (no. 1 
of Sehlegel's Cat.), wing 13*6 inches, tail 7*9, tarsus 1*85; J (no« 2

61 . LEPTODON-. 331 
Young. Above brown, the dorsal feathers and wing-coverts margined 
with pale rufous, the upper tail-eoverts broadly barred and 
tipped with buff; quills dark brown, with rufous-buff tips, the primaries 
barred with dark brown above, the secondaries more or less 
distinctly barred with rufous or rufous buff; the under surface of 
the wing ashy brown, barred with darker brown, the bases of the 
feathers creamy buff, washed with rufous near the tips; tail ashy 
brown, tipped with whitish, barred across with dark brown bars, 
the interspaces on the inner web creamy buff, more or less mottled 
with brown above, at the base barred above and below with creamy 
buff, like the upper tail-coverts; crown of the head dark brown, 
with no pale margins; sides of the face and a collar round the neck 
white, slightly spotted with pale brown, the ear-coverts inclining to 
bluish grey; under surface of body white, the throat indistinctly 
spotted, and the breast narrowly barred with pale brown, the bars 
almost linear on the under tail-coverts, those on the thigh-feathers 
broader and more rufous ,* under wing-coverts and axillaries white, 
barred with pale rufous. Total length 17 inches, culmen 1*65, 
wing 10*4, tail 8*6, tarsus 1*45. 

Another specimen, still quite young, agrees with the foregoing in 
the coloration of the wings and tail, but has the edgings to the 
feathers of the upper surface very much broader, and a broad white 
tip to the tail; the sides of the face and collar round the neck are 
creamy white, without any brown spots; the under surface of the 
body is also more tree from spots, with here and there a feather appearing 
broadly barred with tawny rufous, indicative of the next 
change in the plumage. 

Mature. Altogether different from the preceding stage. Above 
leaden brown, the head more slaty, the sides of the face and chin 
clear slaty blue; round the neck a rufous collar; quills brown, with 
narrow apical margins of pale rufous or buffy white, the outer secondaries 
rufous for nearly their whole extent, the under surface of the 
wing greyish, creamy white near the base, all the quills barred 
above and below with blackish brown; tail ashy grey, crossed by 
two very broad bars of black, tipped with creamy white, before 
which an indistinct subterminal line of ashy grey is visible, some of 
the outer upper tail-coverts and base of tail slightly mottled with 
whitish; under surface of body tawny rufous, crossed with broad 
bars of ochraceous buff, the under wing-coverts similarly marked, 
the lower ones ochraceous buff, with greyish black cross bars. 

The next change seems to be in the under surface, where the 
ochre-coloured bars become quite white, and whitish bars appear on 
the grey throat. Prom this stage (to judge by our specimens) it 
changes by a partial moult, and by a gradual change of feather at 
the same time; for the bars on the breast lose by degrees their rufous 
tint and become grey, while the back also becomes slaty grey instead 
of brown; the nuchal collar gradually disappears. This gradual 
development seems to be satisfactorily traced, with the exception of 
the tail, which, instead of agreeing with that of the rufous or 
" mature " stage, has four rather narrow black bars, like the young 

332 FALC0NTD2E. 

specimen first described. This can only be accounted for by the 
fact that Hawks have really no fixed laws of change in plumage, 
and that it is impossible for any one to define exactly the regular 
sequence of the variations. Isfo two birds are exactly alike; for one 
has the head more advanced, another the tail, and vice versa. Thus 
the bird last noticed as donning his grey dress is very far advanced 
as regards his body-plumage, but has not moulted his tail, whereas 
those in the rufous dress are not so forward in their body-plumage, 
but have already the tail of the adult (one being in the act of 
moulting). 

Adult female. Slaty blue above and below; no trace of a nuchal 
collar; under surface narrowly but irregularly barred with white, 
the under tail-coverts clear buff; under wing-coverts grey, thickly 
barred with bufiy white; quills blackish, shaded with slaty grey 
above, the secondaries entirely of this colour, the under surface 
greyish white, with black bars and tips, less conspicuous on the 
upper surface; tail alternately crossed with two bands of black 
above, with a broad intermediate band of ashy grey between, narrowly 
tipped with ashy grey, barred with ochraceous buff and black 
below, the bars very broad. Total length 17 inches, culmen 1*6, 
wing 11*7, tail 7*5, tarsus 1*4. 

Adult male. A little smaller than the female. Total length 16 
inches, culmen 1*55, wing 11, tail 7*5, tarsus 1*4.

at base, and crossed by about four broad bars, which are nearly 
black, the second bar from the tip accompanied by a narrow, rather 
indistinct bar of rufous; tip of tail narrowly edged with white. 
Bill very large, larger than that of any other species of this genus, 
yellowish white, inclining to bluish horn-colour at base. Total 
length 17 inches. (Gassin, I. c.)

Young. Above brown, all the feathers margined with pale rufous 
brown, the sides of the face and neck much paler and slightly inclining 
to rufous, the nape mixed with white* quills brown, banded 
with black, the bars on the secondaries narrower and nearly obsolete, 
these latter tipped with pale rufous; under surface of wing 
greyish, barred with brown; upper tail-coverts dark brown, banded 
with pale rufous, the lateral ones white at the base, and banded 
also with white; tail pale brown, tipped with whity brown, crossed 
by four black bars, one basal and very narrow; under surface of 
body white, streaked with long shaft-stripes of dark brown, larger 
on the sides of the breast, and forming a broad mesial streak down 
the throat, as well as a clearly defined moustachial streak along the 
lower cheek-line; under wing-coverts white, slightly washed with 
rufous, especially on the outer margin. 
Intermediate stage. This is very different from the young plumage, 
and seems to be attained by a partial, if not complete, moult. 
Upper surface dark brown, a few of the wing-coverts and the inner 
secondaries margined with pale buff or rufous, the latter more 
broadly; entire head and neck all round as well as the whole of the 
underparts pure white (in the specimen described a few brown 
feathers remaining on the crown and behind the eye); quills and 
tail-feathers as in the young. 
Erom this stage the fully adult dress is gained bj a partial moult; 
but the grey shade on the head and neck appears to be the result of 
a change in the feather itself. 
Adult female. Above glossy black, with a very slight greenish 
shade in some lights; quills slaty grey, conspicuously banded with 
black, the under surface of wing paler, white at base, ashy towards 
the apical half, broadly banded with black; upper tail-coverts black, 
barred with ashy grey; tail black, with three bands of ashy grey, 
and narrowly tipped with the same* head slaty grey, a little lighter 
on the sides of the face; entire under surface white; under wing-
coverts black, the lower ones ashy grey, those on the lower part of 
the bend of the wing white; bill horn-black; feet yellow, claws 
horn-brown. Total length 24*5 inches, culmen 1*5, wing 14*5, tail 
10*5, tarsus 1*8. 
Adult male. Similar to the female, but smaller. Total length

upper surface brown, as in the foregoing example, but the greater 
wing-coverts more ashy brown, and tipped with whitish; secondaries 
also tipped with white, and marked largely on the inner web; 
otherwise the wings and tail as in the foregoing; under surface also as 
in No. 10, but a little darker on the chest, where the shaft-stripes 
are broader; forehead and chin whitish. 

Ob$. A young female from Syria is a little more advanced than 
the last, and has lost almost all trace of the buff points to the head-
feathers, excepting a few remains on the hind neck; the forehead 
is white, but the absence of buff over the eye does away with the 
apparent eyebrow of the preceding bird; under surface a little

paler than the foregoing, and the throat whitish, the feathers 
slightly rufescent towards their tips, and having hair-like black 
shafts, widening slightly towards the ends, and a little more distinct 
on the malar line; wings and tail nmeh as in the foregoing example, 
but the wing-coverts not distinctly tipped with white, and the bars 
on tail almost entirely absent. 

Obs. Two specimens, not quite adult, from the Gold Coast, give 
an idea of the changes which take place while the young bird is 
away in its winter quarters. They are a little older than the Syrian 
bird, but have not such a uniform tail, showing, probably, that 
whereas the latter has remains of the cross mottling only on the 
under surface of the tail, these African birds have still considerable 
remains on the upper surface, and yet as regards other points they 
are further advanced in plumage *. In general these birds resemble 
the foregoing plumage, but are a little more uniform above, and 
show scarcely any rufescent margins to the wing-coverts, the secondaries 
also being less distinctly tipped. The white forehead is ies^ 
plain in one bird than in the other ; but both have the paler throat 
and narrow shaft-lines of the preceding plumage. The chief difference 
lies in the fact that they show that the next important change 
of the young bird is on the lower parts, which become broadly 
barred with white. 

The Syrian bird shows no trace of bars, but is uniform underneath 
; the bases of the feathers, however, are whitish, and slight 
mottlings of white are apparent for some part of their extent. The 
passage from this dress to the fully adult plumage next to be described 
is apparently gained by a partial moult as weR as by a 
gradual change of colour, the latter progressing, certainly as regards 
the under surface* until the under surface becomes white with 
remains of the brown bars. The tail is changed by the time the 
grey face appears. 

Adult male. Above brown, the feathers slightly paler "on their 
margins, with a distinct black shaft-stripe, the nape-feathers conspicuously 
white at the base; greater coverts and quills much darker 
at tip, externally shaded with greyish, and having two basal bars of 
dark brown, more conspicuous below, where the feathers are whitish, 
with some slight greyish frecklings on the inner web, much more 
pronounced on the secondaries; upper tail-coverts rather paler 
brown than the back, with obsolete white tips, and rather broad 
bars of white near the base; tail pale brown, narrowly tipped with 
whitish, with which also the immediate base is mottled, the feathers 
crossed with three bands—one subbasal and rather pale brown, one 
median, and another subterminal, both the latter dark brown; head 

* This either shows that the present species does not follow the exact sequence 
of change of plumage in the case of each indiyidual (cf. Sharpe, P. Z. S. 1873, 
p. 416), or else the more uniform tail of the Syrian bird is owing to the inherent 
melanism of the species. Certainly the melanism of many specimens 
which I haye seen affected young birds as well as old; and it is by no means a 
sign of age in Kites. Witness the specimen of Leptodm uncimdus in the Museum, 
which still retains signs of immaturity, but is uniformly fuliginous.

Obs. The young of P. jptilonorhynchus3 if they happen to be crestless, 
are indistinguishable in plumage from the immature of P. apivorus; 
and I have seen young birds from India which I could not separate 
from European examples. A natural inference is that these may not 
be P.jptilonorhynchus but P. apivorus, the young of which may migrate 
to India in the winter. The difficulty in distinguishing young birds 
is most appreciable when the Eastern specimens are without a crest, 
this latter character being most strongly developed in birds from 
Java. Examples from the latter locality in the Leiden Museum 
appeared to be inseparable from Indian birds, but had enormous 
crests. My notes on the specimens in the above museum are as 
follows:—" A young bird (No. 6 of Sehlegel's catalogue) is in tawny 
plumage, like a bird from Bengal, but entirely wants the crest, and 
is rather paler and more fulvous; the tail is ashy brown, with fourteen 
or fifteen bars of darker^ brown to be distinguished. Another 
fine bird from Java is changing from the tawny plumage to that of 
the adult with the grey face. It has a regular line running down 
the cheeks and encircling the throat, which has also a broad central 
streak; the under surface has white cross bars, commencing in the 
usual way; a black crest 3*7 inches long; tail only just shooting; 
wing 17*8."

* The type of this species is said to have come from Zanzibar; it has not been 
met with by Dr. Kirk or any subsequent observer, and is omitted in the great 
work on the birds of Eastern Africa by Drs. Finsch and Hartlaub. I have, 
however, little doubt that, if the locality should prove to be correct, the bird 
from Zanzibar will be identical with that of South Africa.

Nearly adult. Crown of the head and long occipital crest black; 
feathers oyer the eye, as well as the sides and hack of the Deck, 
tawny rufous, the latter spotted with black; the sides of the face 
greyish, washed with rufous; upper surface of body brown, with a 
gloss of purplish brown, some of the feathers also shaded with 
greenish in certain lights; quills brown, tipped with whitish, barred 
with purplish brown, the secondaries very much paler brown, against 
which the bands of darker brown contrast strongly, especially the 
subterminal one, which has a distinct purplish gloss; under surface 
of quills greyish white, with dark brown bands, pure white near the 
base ; tail brown, tipped with whity brown, and crossed by three 
bands of dark purplish brown, the subterminal one being very broad, 
and glossed with greenish; under surface of tail greyish white, like 
that of the wings, the subterminal band distinctly marked, the basal 
ones very faintly, excepting on the outermost feathers, which have a 
patch of dark brown on the outer web, extending on to the inner one 
also ; under surface of the body whitish, broadly streaked on the sides 
of the throat and the chest, banded on the breast, and spotted on the 
under tail-coverts with pale rufous, darker and more inclining to 
rufous brown on the flanks and sides of the body and axillary 
plumes; down the centre of the throat, extending to the fore neck, 
a broad black streak; under wing-coverts huffy white, spotted with 
pale rufous, the lower ones barred with this colour; bill hom-black, 
browner on lower mandible; feet yellow. Total length 17*5 inches, 
culmen 1*5, wing 12*3, tail 8*1, tarsus 1*5. 

Another specimen in the national collection differs from the fore


going in not having so stout a bill, in the sides of the face heing 

more conspicuously grey, this shade also extending over the throat 

and breast, the former of which is narrowly streaked with greyish 

down the centre; the crown of the head is blackish, the feathers 

of the forehead being edged with rufous; the sides and hind part 

of the neck similarly marked, producing a striped appearance; 

occipital crest black, with a narrow white tip to one or two of the 

feathers; the bands on the breast very broad and pale rufous. 

Total length 15*3 inches, culmen 1*35, wing 11*5, tail 7*5, tarsus 

1*5. This would -apparently be the adult male, and the other 

perhaps a female not quite adult.

This species differs from the true B. magnirostris of the Philippines 
in its much larger size, dark brown colour, black head, and 
dark cinereous ear-coverts, in wanting the grey on the chest, and in 
the dark rufous brown of the under surface. This latter colour is 
especially distinct on the chest, the sides of the body and flanks 
"having a few white cross bars. Total length 17't> inches, culmen 
1-25, wing 11-5, tail 8, tarsus 1*65.

cinereous, the former inclining to whitish; throat whitish; fore 
neck and chest buff, with a rufous tinge, which extends on to the 
sides and hinder part of the neck; breast buffy white, barred with 
rufous brown, much more narrowly than in the old bird; thighs 
and under wing- and tail-coverts rich buff, the former crossed near 
the base with a few narrow bars of rufous brown. 
There is some confusion about the Buteo cristaitts of Yieillot. 
Pucheran, in his excellent review on the types of this naturalist 
(Eev. ZooL 1850, p. 84), says that the species so called in the 

* Encyclopedic' is Baza lojphoies; and in that he is doubtless right. 
He also mentions that the bird is not mentioned in the * Kouveau 
Dietionnaire;' but, as Strickland points out, there is a Buteo cristatus 
from "Hew Holland described in this work (vol. iv. p. 481), and he 
refers Yieillot's bird to Baza mhcristata, of which it would be an 
older title. I cannot trace any likeness to this species, and consequently 
omit it from my list of synonyms.

f The absence of the white nuchal collar in Edwards's plate and description 
alone prevents us from fully recognizing the bird here referred to that title. This 
discrepancy may have been caused by the state of the specimen, which is stated 
to have come out of spirits. No other member of the genus suits the description; 
but, with the above allowance being made, it coincides admirably with 
the species afterwards described as Hierax eutolmus.

preferred not to attempt a full diagnosis of the young, in order to avoid confusion.

t The older authors apparently derived their nomenclature from the terras 
in use f® falconry; and it m difficult to tell what their descriptions realty were 
intended for, as in several instances it is evident the Goshawk is mixed up with 
the Peregrine. Two names have been adopted by modem writers, viz, Falco 
communis and Falco peregrinus, titles founded by Gmelm on descriptions of his 
predecessors. The latter has generally been adopted; but inasmuch as both are 
said to have yellow irides, they are both open to the same objection, though they 
are otherwise good descriptions of the Common Peregrine. 1 prefer In this ease 
to employ the title of Falco communis of Gmeiin, founded on the '* Faucon n of 
Briton and Buffon, There can be no doubt as to the species intended by the 
latter, as will be seen by the figures in the ' Planches Enluuimees.'

05s. In the ' Annals of Natural History' for March 1873 I gave 
the result of my studies on the Peregrine Ealcons in the Museum 
collection, and recognized eight species, viz.:—1. Falco communis, 
Gm.; 2. F. hroohii, Sharpe; 3. F. nigriceps, Cass.; 4. F. micrurus, 
Hodgs.; 5. F. peregrinator, Sund.; 6. F. melanogenys, Gould; 7. F. 
minor, Bp.; and 8. F. cassini, Sharpe. Since writing that article I 
have studied these Falcons in several continental museums, especially 
in the Leiden collection, where an admirahle series exists. I 
find, therefore, that some of my conclusions require modification. 
In the first place the characters of plumage in Falco brooJcii are not 
trustworthy; and all that can be said of that bird is, that it probably 
represents a small race resident in the countries bordering 
the Mediterranean Sea. Then, again, Mr. Salvin has suggested to 
me that my F. cassini is the true F. nigriceps of Cassin. On a reexamination 
of this question I must indorse my previous views on 
the subject. In their recently published * Nomenclator,' Messrs. 
Sclater and Salvin recognize only one species of Peregrine all over 
the New "World, viz. F. communis, being in this respect at variance 
with the late Mr. Cassin, Mr. Gurney, and myself. I cannot help 
thinking that any one devoting a close study to these confessedly 
difficult birds will find that there are three southern forms, confined 
to and resident in the extreme south of America, Africa, and 
Australia. At the same time the true northern type of Peregrine 
occurs, though rarely, within the domain of these resident species, 
migrating thence from the north ; and although there is not much 
difficulty about the African and Australian birds, there is a question 
as to the nomenclature,of the New-World species. It is therefore 
necessary to examine the works in which Mr. Cassin alludes to his 

* Falco nigriceps. "We find that he first speaks of it in the < Birds 
of Texas/ and fixes the date of the title as " December 1853." It 
seems clear to me that he intended the North-American bird to be 
the true F. nigriceps, as he points out the distinctions between the 
western bird and that from eastern North America (F. communis 
vel anatum). At the same time he mentions that his species goes 
down to Chili (Gilliss), and he figures a presumed Chilian specimen 
in the report on the l U. S. Astronomical Expedition' published in 
1855. This, Mr. Salvin thinks, indicates that the Chilian Peregrine 
was intended by Cassin to be the typical F. nigriceps, while I contend 
that there is nothing to show that he recognized a second form in 
South America, although there undoubtedly is such form; nor is there 
382 
FALC0ZW3Z. 

any evidence that the above-mentioned figure was taken from a Chilian 
specimen, though the inference is that this was the case; but if the 
figure is intended for the bird I call F. cassi/ii, it is not a good 
likeness at all. Until an examination of the types has taken place 
I prefer to continue my nomenclature of these American birds, 

• 
though I would not now separate specifically the eastern and western 
Peregrines of Xorth America. 
Another point remaining to be cleared up is the identity of FaTco 
atriceps of Hume, This I was inclined formerly to refer to F. m krvnts 
of Hodgson, a species which I would not now separate from the ordinary 
F. communis. But ilr. Blanford informs me that his Impression 
is that Mr. Hume's F. atriceps is the bird named by me F. pcrrgrinator, 
the true F. peregrhuiior being a Falcon from Central and 
Southern India, not at present represented in the Museum collection, 
and probably unknown to European naturalists. As, however, the 
bird 1 call F. peregrinator is undoubtedly the one thus named in 
other European museums, I must retain that title until I have the 
opportunity of examining named specimens of F. afncejts.

Adidt nude. Above ashy brown, with fulvous margins to the feathers, 
some of which are also barred across with the same colour; 
lower part of the back, rump, and upper tail-coverts dark bluish 
grey, with black cross bars, the latter shading rather into fulvous; 
wing-coverts all coloured like the upper back, with a scarcely pronounced 
grey shade; quills dark brown, externally washed with 
ashy grey; the inner web so broadly barred with whitish that the 
alternate brown bars are imperfect and very small; secondaries 
tipped with buhy white, the innermost browner and more resembling 
the wing-coverts; tail ashy brown, with a distinct greyish shade 
on the centre feathers, these more obsoletely, the others distinctly 

* Professor Schlegel named this bird as above, but afterwards reverted to the 
name of Falco lanarius, because he became convinced that it was the Lanner of 
old falconers. We have, however, to deal with the question of the proper title 
of this species according to the recognized rules of nomenclature. Falco 
lanarius is G-melin's title, taken direct from Linnseus's bird of the same name 
(Faun. Suec. p. 22. no. 62). This is irrecognizable, but looks like a young 
Peregrine; it certainly is not the Falcon now known as the trueJjanner. It is 
likewise mixed up with the Lanier of Buffon (Hist. Nat. Ois. i. P-S&3), and the 
Lanneret of Albin (Nat. Hist, of Birds, ii p. 7, pi. 7), Considering the confusion 
in which the specific name is involved, it seems better to adopt the term of 
Falco feldeggii, which undoubtedly belongs to the species.

* For the description of a still younger bird, see Shelley's ' Birds of Egypt * 

(p. 189). This bird is more thickly blotched with brown on the breast, resembling 
in tbis respect the young of Falco jvggnr. It is, however, distinguished 
from this species by its pale rufous white head. The absence of rufous edgings 
to the dorsal feathers is another peculiarity; but I think there is no doubt that 
it is only a young Lanner. I think my friend Captain Shelley is wrong in supposing 
his bird with the whitish head and streaked breast to be the very old 
bird. It is, in my opinion, not aged, though nearly mature, as is shown by the 
brownish ashy colour of the tail, the bars across the dorsal plumes, the pale head, 
and the streaks on the breast, which disappear and merge into spots in the 
fully adult Lanner.

It is darker than either of its allies, and in size is slightly larger, as 
will be seen by the following measurements:—

:i92 FALCOHIILE. 

Adult male. Porehead rather broadly whitish; fore part of crown 
deep greyish black; rest of crown and nape deep brick-red, varied 
with black shaft-stripes, on the nape the black collecting in the centre 
and forming a nuchal spot, the rufous shade paler over the eye, forming 
an almost imperceptible eyebrow; cheek-stripe, feathers round 
the eye, and a line running along the upper margin of the ear-coverts

Adult female. Above black, with, a slight slaty grey shade, more 
distinct on the lower back, rump, and tail, the bars on the latter 
being obsolete; cheeks and ear-coverts entirely black, like the head; 
under surface of body uniform bright chestnut; throat and sides of 
neck creamy white, the latter with a slight wash of chestnut; under 
wing-coverts chestnut like the breast, some of the lower ones barred 
with black ; primaries black, with a few rufous bars near the base ; 
cere, orbits, and feet yellow; bill bluish black, yellow at base ; iris 
dark brown. Total length 13*5 inches, culmen 0*95, wing 9*1, tail

Adult male. Similar to, but smaller than, the female. Total length 
11*7 inches, wing 8-5, tail 4*5, tarsus 1*15. 

Young. Similar to the adult, but the breast covered with median 
tear-shaped black spots on each feather, the tail broadly banded and 
tipped with rufous, as also are the primaries; nape slightly varied 
with rufous; throat purer white than in the adult. 

Obs. Mr. Hume describes a bird he got in very similar plumage, 
which turned out to be a female. The Museum specimen is a female 
also; and that this is an immature plumage is proved by the fact 
that another specimen from Nepal, though adult, still retains traces 
of the bars on the tail.

Total length 11-8 inches, wing 9*2, tarsus 1*35. 

Adult female (marked a male in the Leiden Museum, but probably 
in error; type of the species). Smoky black above and below, some

indistinct; secondaries very narrowly tipped with buffy white; 
throat creamy white, streaked on the lower part with black; under 
surface of body black, with a few remains of chestnut edgings to the 
feathers of the abdomen and flanks; thighs chestnut, streaked with

under wing-coverts black, tipped with deep chestnut. Total length 
12-4 Inches, culmcn 0*9, wing 9*8, tail 5*7, tarsus 1-45. 

Sab. Ceram, Gilolo. 

Ohs. Professor Schlegel has figured this bird (I.e.) in its two stages 
as above described, and he now places them in the Leiden Museum 
along with F. severus instead of F. huwlatus. "Whether it i*> merely 
an accidental melanism which takes place in the southern habitat of 

F. severus, as Prince Bonaparte and Prof. Schlegel consider, we shall 
wait for a larger series to determine. At present it seems to me to 
be a distinct bird, replacing F. severus in Gilolo and Cer.iMi, the 
latter bird not reaching beyond Celebes. The title Is derived from 
Temminck's MS. name in the Leiden Museum (ef. Bp. Consp. p. 25y 
sub F* severus).

the inner web ; forehead and lores white* sides of face, fore part of 
the cheeks, and ear-coverts brownish black; hind part of cheeks, 
sides of neck, and throat white, slightly tinged with rufous ; under 
surface of the body pale dingy rufous, with a few shaft-stripes on the 
breast and the remains of obsolete grey cross bars on the flanks; 
under wing-coverts dingy rufous, obsoletely barred with brown and 
tipped with fulvous; cere and base of upper mandible yellow; bill 
bluish lead-colour, black at tip; feet yellow, claws black; iris blackish 
brown. Total length 11-5 inches, culmen 0-8, wing 9*7, tail 5*9, 
tarsus 1*3. 

Adult female. Similar to the male, but larger. Total length 13-5 
inches, culmen 0*85, wing 10*5, tail 6, tarsus 1*45. 

To vtig. Above slaty blue, with broad rust-coloured margins to the 
feathers, the secondaries plainly tipped with buffy white; the crown 
and upper tail-coverts rusty, being quite obscured by the margins to 
the feathers; forehead whitish; fore part of cheeks, region of the 
eye, and ear-coverts brownish black; hinder part of cheeks, sides of 
neck, and throat creamy white; chest creamy buff, tinged with rufous, 
with several dark brown streaks down the centre of the feathers; 
remainder of under surface deep rufous * the lower abdomen, vent, 
and under tail-coverts tawny buff, with a few rufous shaft-stripes 
and bars; under wing-coverts dull rufous, with oval spots of creamy 
buff; primaries dark brown, tipped with whitish and barred on the 
inner web with rufous • tail greyish above, browner beneath, all the 
feathers barred across and tipped with rufous. 

Ohs. The birds above described are certainly the adults and young 
of one and the same species. In the Museum, however, are three 
specimens, one of which is from Tasmania, and the two others simply 
marked "Australia/' but agreeing in every respect with each other : 
all the other specimens are from various parts of the Australian 
continent, as noticed below. I cannot help thinking that these three 
birds belong to a different species. They are slightly smaller than 
the male described (wing 9*4) and are very much darker, being 
black with a slight greyish shade; the throat and chest are thickly 
streaked with black, and the sides of the body mottled with blackish 
cross bars. These are, perhaps, only in the intermediate stage before 
assuming the adult dress • and this idea is favoured by the presence 
of the cross bars on the sides, remains of which are seen even in 
quite adult birds.

* Gmelin appears to have derived his species from the " Gerfaut" of Brisson. 
The latter seems to have had a very good idea of the differences of the Gerfalcons, 
as also had Briinnich. Button (and from him Gmelin) at first mixed 
the three species hopelessly together, though he afterwards came to think that 
there were three different races. In the * Planches Enlumin^es' I canfind no

Greenland Falcon, Salvin 4' Brodr. Falconry, pis. xli & xiii. (1855). 

Adult female. Snowy white, without any markings at all underneath 
; head likewise unspotted, with a slight greyish shade under 
the eye, and a few narrow blackish shaft-stripes on the nape; all 
the rest of the hack scantily marked with blaekibh spots of irregular 
form, some oval, some tear-shaped, and some longitudinal; quills 
white, with a large suMerminal patch of brownish black, the shafts 
Mack, all the feathers more or less irregularly spotted or notched 
with blackish on the outer web, less on the inner one, which is 
white for the greater part of its length; tail pure white, the shafts 
white, excepting on the two centre feathers, where they are blackish, 
inclining gradually to white towards the tips; cere and orbits pale 
yellow; bill pale yellow, bluish at Up; feet pale yellow; iris dark 
brown. Total length 23 inches, cuimen 1-5, wing 16*2, tail 9*5, 
tarsus 2*35. 

Young male. White, mottled all over with pale brown, which 
occupies the centre of the feathers of the upper surface, and takes 
the form of spots and irregular bars on the wing-feathers; head 
and sides of the face streaked with brown, and the under surface 
covered with longitudinal streaks of pale brown; tail white, with 
brown cross bands on the centre feathers, breaking up into irregular 

drawn from the birds themselves, but were taken from other engravings (perhaps 
Brisson's), with the contour slightly altered to suit his page, and men 
coloured from descriptions. The Norway Falcon he expressly mentions as 
having been sent to him. In the 'Histoire Naturelle,* which was published 
after the ' Planches Enlmninees/ he appears to have become acquainted with 
the Iceland Falcon, as this work contains an excellentfigure (pi. xiii.) of the 
bird, as good, indeed, as the colouredfigures in his other work are bad.

mottlings on the other rcctrices. Total length 20 inches, culmen 
1-2, wing 14*5, tail 9, tarsus 2*1. 

Obs. The following is submitted as an explanation of the sequence 
of plumage in the Greenland Falcon, for further particulars and 
figures of which see P. Z. S. 1873, p. 417:—Prom the stage above 
described the young bird moults and takes a white plumage, with 
broad blackish centres to the feathers, and the stripes on the head 
rather distinct. The breast has a few spots of black, while the tail is 
white with black shafts and a few blackish mottlings, excepting the 
two centre feathers, which are barred across. In this stage it is 
figured by Mr. Gould as a supposed " dark race.'7 In gaining the 
fully adult plumage the markings on the dorsal feathers gradually 
absorb themselves, first into a broad crescent, and then by degrees 
into an arrow-shaped or ovate spot. The head loses its stripes and 
the tail its mottling and bars, becoming pure white, even the shafts 
of the latter participating in this change. There is no apparent 
difference in the colouring of the sexes; but the female is always 
the larger. There appears likewise to be no regular sequence observed 
by the different parts in change; sometimes the back is 
further advanced than the tail or breast, or, again, these may have 
more completely taken their adrft pluma^thafe the back. In its 
old stage the bird is figured by Mr. Gould as a " light race/7 the 
hinder figure in his plate being only a trifle less aged than the one 
in the foreground.

feathers which remain; quills dark brown, the secondaries margined 
with whitish near the tip, and coloured as above described, the 
feathers white underneath at the base, notched with greyish near 
the shaft, the notches developing into bars towards the tip; tail 
greyish brown, tipped and spotted with white on the outer web, these 
spots being rather more oval on the inner, the middle feathers 
scarcely marked at all with faint white or buff spots, which are quite 
obsolete near the base; top of the head dark brown, slightly tinged 
with rufous and streaked with white; frontal band and a broad line 
over the ear-coverts and the hinder neck white, the two latter 
mottled with dark brown ; lores, feathers under the eye, and upper 
margin of ear-coverts greyish brown; a narrow cheek-stripe dark 
brown; sides of face and neck white, the former narrowly streaked 
withbrown, the latter plainly dotted with triangular spots of the same; 
throat, vent, and under tail-coverts white; rest of under surface 
white, with conspicuous rounded spots of dark brown on the breast, 
becoming more oval and longitudinal in shape on the lower breast 
and sides of the body; under wing-coverts brown in the centre, with 
broad white edges. Total length 17 inches, culmen 1*3, wing 14*7, 
tail 12*5, tarsus 2*1. 

Obs. The adult bird described is an ordinary old Saker, the fully 
adult or aged bird being very rare indeed. When in its complete 
dress this Palcon looks like a gigantic Kestrel, all the feathers of the 
upper surface, as well as the tail, being barred with pale rufous; 
the under parts are rich creamy white, with a few blackish spots on 
the lower breast and abdomen, taking the form of bars on the flanks • 
the under wing-coverts are also spotted and barred with blackish. 
The head is rufous, with blackish central streaks to the feathers ; 
forehead and cheeks whitish, the ear-coverts tinged with rufous, the 
feathers under the eye and a moustachial stripe blackish brown ; on 
the upper surface there is a slight shade of grey, especially on the 
inner secondaries and upper tail-coverts. In this state of plumage 
the bird is H. milvipes of Hodgson and H. Tiendersoni of Hume. 

Hab. South-eastern Europe; N.E. Africa, extending thence

rufous; the facial features more pronounced than in the adult. 

Ohs. The possession by the Museum of the original types of Hieracidea 
berigora, which were received from the Linnean Society, enables 
me to prove that the H. occidentalis of Gould is the true H.

426 FAXCOsrnxB. 

Adult male. Upper parts brick-red, with a few arrow-head markings 
of black, larger on the inner secondaries* primary coverts and 
quills dark brown, the former narrowly margined with rufous, the 
primaries notched with white for about two thirds of their length, 
the inner primaries and outer secondaries narrowly edged and tipped 
with huffy white; head and neck clear blue-grey, with narrow black 
shaft-stripes; forehead and narrow eyebrow huffy white; cheeks 
silvery grey, inclining to blackish below the eye and on the fore part 
of cheeks, forming a tolerably distinct moustache; lower back, rump, 
upper tail-coverts, and tail clear blue-grey, the latter tipped with 
ashy white, before which is a broad subterminal band of black; 
throat and under tail-coverts buff, unspotted; remainder of under 
surface rufous fawn; the chest-feathers mesially streaked with black, 
these dark centres being larger and more oval in shape on the flank-
feathers; the thighs clear rufous, unspotted; under wing-coverts 
white, spotted with black; bill bluish horn-colour, black at tip, yellowish 
at base; cere, orbits, and feet yellow; iris brown. Total 
length 12*5 inches, culm en 1*75, wing 9*2, tail 6*7, tardus 1*6. 

Adult female. Similar to the male underneath, but not so deeply 
coloured. Upper surface entirely rufous, banded with black, with a 
faint bluish shade on the rump; the upper tail-coverts inclining to 
buff; head rufous, streaked with black ; tail rufous, banded with 
black, the bars not being strictly continuous, tipped with bufry white, 
before which is a conspicuous broad band of black; facial features 
and soft parts as in the male. Total length 12*5 inches, culmen -75, 
wing 9-2, tail 6*5, tarsus 1*6. 

Young male. Resembling the old female, but rather paler and 
more distinctly striped on the breast. The tail first changes, becoming 
blue like that of the old male; and thus birds are often seen in 
partial plumage, having the blue tail of the adult male, but retaining 
the rufous head of the old female dress* 

Hab. The whole of Europe and Northern Asia, migrating in winter 
into K China, the Indian peninsula, and X.E. Africa, occasionally 
wandering into Western and Southern Africa and the Seychelles. 

Obs. In certain countries along the southern habitat of the common 
Kestrel occurs a dark resident form which has by some authors 
been considered to be a distinct species. To the westward the dark 
race is first found in Madeira and the Canaries, and does not seem 
to occur in Europe proper. In Senegambia it may also occur, as 
suggested by Mr. Godman (* Ibis,' 1872, p. 165), as "it was probably 
a dark Kestrel that Swainson named Falco^rufescens, Again, in 
Abyssinia the same dark-coloured form occurs, and has received the 
name of Falco rupicolceformis; and it is not until we get to the 
Himalayas that another intensified race is met with: here it is the 
F, inUrstincius of M'Clelland. Mr. Blyth seems to have seen a 
similar race fromBurmah, as a Kestrel is mentioned on Ms authority 
by Mr. G. R. Gray (Hand-L B. i. p. 23) under the name of Tinmmcuius 
abratm; but I have not yet succeeded in unearthing Mr. Blyth's 

own reference. In China and Japan the largest and darkest race of 

78 . CERCJfNEIS. 
427 
Common Kestrel occurs; and some remarks of mine on Mr. Swinhoe's 
excellent series will be found in Dresser's ' Birds of Europe.' 

Throughout all these dark races of Kestrel one character is predominant 
in addition to the richer and more intense coloration of the 
male bird, viz. that the female has more or less of a shade of blue 
on the rump and tail, which sometimes overspreads the whole of the 

latter.

The Museum contains two specimens of the Kestrel from the Cape-
Yerd Islands, recently described as Faleo neglectus by Professor 
Schlegel. The type specimen comes from St. Yincent, where it was 
collected by Mr. Keulemans; and the birds in the Museum are from 
St. lago, obtained by Mons. A. Bouvier. The latter do not bear out 
the characters which Professor Schlegel assigns to the species, at 
least as regards the banding of the underparts; but the size is certainly 
remarkably small, and the plumage very dark. In my opinion 
it is only a small dark-coloured race; and although the size is unusually 
reduced, it is approached by other specimens. "Witness the 
following measurements;—

VOL. i. 2G 

434 PAiCONm®. 

Adult female. Similar to male, but larger. Total length 11 inches, 
wing 8*2, tarsus 1*55. 

Nestling (Mus. Lugd.). Beep rufous, broadly streaked on the head 
and neck, and barred on the back with black; tail deep rufous, 
broadly tipped with creamy buff, and barred with black, the subterminal 
band very broad; sides of face and neck pale rufous ; the 
throat, thighs, and under tail-coverts buffy white; the chest streaked 
and the breast spotted or barred with black. 

Ohs. The rufous colour on the underparts is shown by the foregoing 
bird to be a sign of youth; and remains of it are to be found 
on some of the white-breasted birds. As, however, examples of both 
sexes of white and rufous-tinted birds are killed at the same seasons 
of the year (as is shown by the carefully collected series in the 
Leiden Museum), the only way to account for these differences is by 
supposing that it is some time before the bird attains maturity, and 
probably breeds in the rufous dress. It should be noticed that the 
rufous individuals have more grey on the head than the white-
breasted ones.

the rufous crown; back vinous cinnamon, marked on the 
lower scapulars and inner secondaries with a few black cross bars; 
lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts, and tail clearer cinnamon, 
tipped with greyish white, before which is a subterminal black band, 
the outer feather also greyish white on the outer web ; wing-coverts 
entirely bright slaty blue, mesially marked with elongated oval spots 
of black; quills blackish brown, narrowly margined with paler 
brown, the inner primaries and the secondaries tipped with greyish 
white, all the quills broadly barred with white on the inner web;

concealed, the innermost secondaries spotted conspicuously with 
black; cheeks and ear-coverts silvery white, somewhat shaded with 
greyish, and tinged with buff; a moustaehial streak from the fore 
part of eye along the cheeks black, as well as a patch behind the 
ear-coverts, and another on the sides of the neck; throat white, 
unspotted; rest of under surface pale nifous, inclining to cinnamon 
on the sides of the breast, and much paler on the flanks ; the thighs, 
abdomen, and under tail-coverts clear buff, unspotted, the chest 
slightly streaked, the breast and flanks spotted with black; under 
wing-coverts white, spotted and streaked with black ; feet orange ;

Younger males have more bars on the upper surface, the remains 
oi their immature dress, which resembles the old female. Considerable 
difference exists in the shade of the cinnamon back, this 
colour appearing to me to fade from exposure.

Adult male. Head entirely slaty blue, with blackish shaft-stripes; 
lores, forehead, an indistinct eyebrow and sides of the face white; a 
streak from the fore part of eye, down the cheeks, as well as one 
running behind the ear-coverts and another on the side of neck, 
black; nape black, nearly joining the last-mentioned Mack stripe 
on the sides of the neck; upper surface of body rich cinnamon, 
with a few blackish bars on the scapulars, broader on the lower 
ones; wing-coverts dark slaty bine, spotted with black, the primary 
coverts barred with black ; quills black, barred with white on the 
inner web, the secondaries black at base, slaty blue at tip, the innermost 
barred with Mack on the inner web; tail deep cinsaz&on, 

tipped with greyish white, before wMch a broad Mack band, the 
outer feather greyish white, barred with blaek on the inner web to 
a little beyond the shaft on the outer one, and cinnamon only for 
about half of the inner web; under surface of body bully white, 
more or less inclining to dull cinnamon on the chest (though often 
only yellowish); the sides of the body thickly sprinkled with pear-
shaped or oval spots of black; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
white, the former spotted, the latter barred with blaek; cere, orbits, 
and feet deep yellow, ©lawsblaek; bill horn-blue, yellowish at base 
of lower mandible. Total length 10-4 inches, culnien 0*85, wing 
7*4, tail 5*1, tarsus 1-4. 

Adult female. Head entirely blue like the male, or with only a 

slight tinge of rufous on the occiput; nape blaek as in male : upper 

plumage and tail cinnamon, barred across with blaek; under surface 

whitish, the chest narrowly streaked with pale rufous shaft-stripes, 

these being broader on the breast and sides of the body. Total length 

11 inches, culmen 0-65, wing 7-7, tall 5-5, tarsus 1*4. 

Obs. Peruvian examples, as well as two from Few Granada in the 

Museum, are not so thickly spotted on the flanks, and are rather 

stouter in appearance. The males measure 7*S-7*85 in the wing,

rump, all the feathers crossed by bars of black, nowhere very distinct ; 
tail bluish grey, with narrow black bars, excepting the subterminal 
one, which is much broader; quills brownish black, externally 
washed with grey and barred with white about halfway up the inner 
web; crown of the head dull blackish, as also are the lores, feathers 
round the eye, and a slightly indicated moustachial streak; sides of 
the face and neck, as well as the throat, creamy white, unspotted; 
entire breast white, streaked with central blotches of black down

thickly covered with blackish central streaks to the feathers; the 
thighs and under tail-coverts buffy white, the former tinged with 
rufous. 

Obs. The adult female of this bird closely resembles the male 
of the Common Hobby, but may be distinguished unfailingly by the 
black bars on the upper surface and on the tail, which the Hobby 
never has. The young birds are also liable to be confounded together; 
but the immature of the present species, besides having black bars 
on the secondaries and lower back, has a grey tail with conspicuous 
black transverse bars, whereas in the young Hobby the tail is blackish, 
with rufous cross bars.

Nestling. Covered with down of a sooty brown colour, except 
along the centre of the back, along the carpal bend of the wing, on 
the breast and flanks, where it Is dusky white; all the feathers of 
the back are dark brown, with a broad tip of oehraceous buff; 
crown and ear-coverts blackish ; eyebrow and throat white. 

Young. Glossy chocolate-brown, all the feathers terminally margined 
with bufry white, these margins somewhat tinged with rufous, 
and broadest on the secondary quills and upper tail-coverts; crown 
of head black, with white or fulvous margins to the feathers, giving 
a distinctly streaked appearance; nape white, not streaked; from 
behind the eye a broad line of white runs down the side of the 
neck,'slightly streaked with black; below this another line of black 
feathers, including the ear-coverts, is conterminous; sides of face 
and entire underparts pure white, somewhat tinged here and there 
with yellowish buff; under wing-coverts white, the outer ones 
strongly washed with tawny buff, and crossed with broad bar-5 of 
dark brown ; primaries black, secondaries chocolate-brown like the 
back, and tioped in the same manner, all of them whitish at base 
of inner weB, indistinctly barred with pale brown; tail-feathers 
alternately barred with dark sepia-brown and abhy brown, tipped 
w^th whitish,, ana having whitish shafts; the bars six in number, 
and more distinct on the inner web, which is huffy white. 

* Adult. Above brown, most of the feathers with obsolete margins 
of*paler brown, more distinct on the wing-coverts; primaries black, 
secondaries brown like the back, the primaries pale, but uniform 
wldty brown below, the secondaries whitish on the inner web, with

exactly similar, there being a continued alteration in the pattern of 
the feather itself. At the same time two young birds, distinguished by 
the fulvous margins to the upper surface, have not a similar amount 
of brown on the breast; for in one it is almost entirely absent, 
while the other has very few markings indeed. The tail becomes, 
more uniform brown with age, so that a strongly barred tail is a 
sure sign of immaturity. 

I notice that American examples are often of a darker and richer 
brown than European examples, and are sometimes rather larger.

white extending further on the secondaries, which have also ashy 
"brown cross bars; tail fulvous brown, mottled all over with dark 
brown, except at the tip, which is uniform dark brown, forming a 
very distinct band. 

The bird above described, though full-grown, is evidently immature 
as regards its plumage. The second stage is very similar to 
the adult hereafter described, but is by no means so grey on the 
head and throat; and the tail is nearly uniform brown in a specimen 
of Mr. Hodgson's in the Museum; only on the inner web are the 
mottlings apparent which indicate the gradual approach of the 
white tail. As will be seen in the description, the young specimen 
was further advanced as regards its tail, so that it is possible that 
the changes from first to second plumage are not effected in any 
regular sequence, as is the case also in other Accipitres. 

Adult male. Above brown, paler on the interscapulary region and 
darker on the wings, the primaries blackish; under surface of wing 
leaden brown, with a whitish spot at base of primaries; tail white, 
with a broad terminal bar of brown; entire head and neck all round 
clear ashy grey; breast brown, a little lighter than the back; belly, 
vent, thighs, lower flanks, and under tail-coverts pure white; under 
wing-coverts uniform ashy brown; cere and bill blackish; feet 
dirty yellowish white; iris brown. Total length 26 inches, culmen 
2*3, wing 18, tail 10, tarsus 3*75. 

Adult female. Similar to the male but larger. Total length 
29 inches, wing 20-4, tarsus 3*9. 

After a careful examination of Mr. Hodgson's plates, I have not 
been able to distinguish his H. jplumbeus. In size and general appearance 
it would appear to resemble P. Tiumilis; but I have never 
seen a specimen of either of these species at all approaching a uniform 
leaden grey like the bird represented, and the drawing is, perhaps, 
unfinished. The hinder figure on the plate of H. plumbem I 
am able to identify among Mr. Hodgson's specimens, as also all the 
other Hawks figured by him, excepting the grey one in question. 
Although the uniform tail he figures more resembles P. Tiumilis 
(which is now known to extend to Assam, and may therefore well 
occur in Nepal), there is not a specimen in Mr. Hodgson's collection; 
and as all his other birds of these species are in the Museum, and 
as he also figured a true P. icMhyaetus on the same plate, I consider 
B.plumbeus to be probably an unfinished picture of the large 
species.

Lord "Walden has kindly lent me a specimen of the young bird, 
which I describe. 

Young. AboTe dark brown, the feathers lighter on their margins; 
wing-coverts coloured like the back, but the greater series with 
narrow white margins; hind neck paler than back, rufous brown, 
with dark brown longitudinal centres, causing a slightly streaked 
appearanee; quills blackish, with whity brown shafts; the secondaries 
paler brown, like the scapularies, all the quills narrowly 
banded with black, nearly obsolete on the primaries, but more distinct 
on the secondaries, especially underneath, where the lining 
of the wing is whitish; tail dark brown, whitish at tip, and crossed 
with seren or eight rather narrow bands of black; crown of head 
dark brown, with tiny cream-coloured tips to the feathers; the occipital 
crest black, and 1*9 inch long; forehead and eyebrow Tery 
broad, rich creamy buff; cheeks and entire underparts creamy 
white, as also the tarsal feathers and under wing- and tail-coverts, 
the greater under wing-coverts with a few indistinct blackish bars. 
Total length 20*5 inches, wing 18*3, tail 8-5, tarsus 2-5,

Mr. A. Anderson has recently identified another small Indian 
Kite, which he calls M. palustris. Of this species I have not yet 
seen an example. 

Milvus palustris. 

Milvus palustris, Anders. Pr. A. 8. B. 1873, p. 142. 

"The Kite for which I have proposed this name is somewhat 
smaller than M. govinda, Sykes ; but in point of coloration it is very 
nearly a facsimile of M. major, Hume—in fact a perfect miniature of 
that species. While the amount of white under the wings, extending 
in some examples to two thirds of the length of the primaries 
(confined, however, to the inner webs), and the rich rufous tone of 
the plumage generally tend to assimilate M. palustris to M. major, 
these characters tend equally to separate the former from either of 
the other two species, viz. M. govinda and M. affinis—i. e. supposing 
the latter to be really worthy of specific distinction as an Indian 
bird. There is also a considerable amount of white and pale buff 
about the head and neck of the new bird which is never present in 
its common congener if. govinda, from which it has not hitherto 
been discriminated." 

" c$. Total length 20-20! inches, wing 16. $. Total length 
21-22 inches, wing 16f-17." (Anderson, I. c.)
