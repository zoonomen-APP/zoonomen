BIRDS 


BRITISH MUSEUM. 

VOLUME II. 

LONDONPRINTED 
BY ORDER OP THE TRUSTEES. 
1875. 


INTRODUCTION. 

THE total number of the species of Owls is now about 190. The 
Bntibh Museum contains 153, so that 37 are still wanting to 
complete the collection; the specific distinction of perhaps 10 of 
these is dubious, 

The exact number of specimens of Btriges enumerated in this 
\oIume is 1090. Besides the series acquired by the purchase of 
Mr. A. E. "Wallace's collection, which contained many species before 
unrepresented, in addition to numerous types, no great collections of 
Owls have been obtained by the British Museum, as there is always 
great difficulty in procuring specimens of these birds. The list of 
desiderata, however, has been considerably decreased by purchases, 
as well as presents from the following gentlemen:—Viscount "Walden, 
Lord lilford, Baron A. von Hiigel, Major Hayes Lloyd, Captain 
(jr. E. Shelley, Professor Sehlegel, Messrs. John Gould, W. Wilson 
Saunders, Osbert Salvin, Howard Saunders, Dr. B. Hinde, Messrs. 
T\ E. Buckley, H. E. Blissett, and A. Bouvier. 

The special thanks of the author for valuable assistance and loan 
of specimens are due to Viscount Walden, Captain Shelley, Br. Otto 
Finseh, Messrs..Salvin and Godman, Howard Saunders, R. Swinhoe, 
Herr C. GodefTroy, of Hamburgh, Count Salvador!, of Turin; but, 
above all, to Mr. Allan Hume, who was so kind as to send to 
England a complete series of the smaller Indian Owls, including the 
types of many species not yet represented in European museums. 
The authorities of the Norwich Museum have also forwarded to 
London all the specimens which it was necessary to examine, 
including some of the rarest species. 

Vlll INTRODUCTION. 

As in the former volume, the affixes to the names of the persons 
from whom the specimens were obtained may be explained as follows 
:—" [P.] " means " Presented by ; " " [C] " = " Collected by ;" 
" [E.J " = " Obtained by exchange." Where Done of the above signs 
are used, the specimens were purchased.

PREFACE. 

Tiiii Second Volume of the "'Catalogue of Birds In the British 
Museum f has been prepared by Mr. Ii. B. Sharpe, one of the 
Senior Assistants in the Zoological Department; it contains an 
account of all the species of Nocturnal Birds of Prey known at 
presentj with a complete list of references to the literature* Every 
effort has been made to render the Collection in the British Museum 
as complete as possible, and to enable the author to overcome the 
unusual difficulties that present themselves in this family of Birds 
as regards the discrimination of the species, as well as their 

description.

Adult female (type of species). Above tawny, broadly streaked 
with black down the centre of the feathers, the tawny colour being 
restricted to spots or broad lateral margins; scapulars more fulvous 
than the back, with less black in the centres of the plumes, the 
entire outer web tawny fulvous, contrasting with the dorsal plumes; 
wing-coverts rather blacker than the back, the tawny colour restricted 
to the external web and spots and bars on the inner, all the 
feathers broadly tipped with tawny; quills brown, chequered with 
tawny spots on the outer web, represented by bars on the inner, 
the tawny bars paler on the secondaries, but more completely traversing 
the feathers, which are likewise tipped with tawny buff; 
innermost secondaries pale brown in centre, the brown cross bars not 
complete, and often replaced with pale tawny brown, scarcely darker 
than the fulvous interspace, thus producing a mottled appearance; 
lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts deep tawny, the centres 
of the feathers black, forming irregular bars towards the tips of the 
tail-coverts; tail blackish brown, tipped with fulvous and crossed 
with bands of pale tawny rufous; head and neck, including the 
auricular tufts, deep tawny, the feathers black down the centres; 
loral plumes whitish with white shafts, and tipped with blackish; 
ear-coverts tawny rufous, slightly varied with fulvescent centres to 
the feathers; throat fulvescent; fore neck conspicuously white, with 
narrow black central streaks to the feathers in the shape of a reversed 
spear-head; remainder of under surface of body golden 
tawny, with broad black streaks down the centre of the breast-
feathers, becoming less pronounced on the flanks and much narrower 
on the under tail-coverts; under wing-coverts tawny, with 
brown centres to the feathers, the lower series buny white at base, 
ashy brown at tips, thus resembling somewhat the inner lining of 
the wing; cere bluish; bill also bluish, blacker at tip; feet greyish, 
the reticulations whiter, soles of feet pinkish; claws yellow, pinkish 
on margins; iris bright yellow*. Total length 26-5 inches, culmen 
2-5, wing 18-5, tail 9-5, tarsus 3-8, auricular tufts 3-2. 

Young, Much paler than the adult and more fulvous, the streaks 
down the feathers of the upper surface not nearly so black or strongly 
pronounced, the under surface also pale fulvous, with light brown 
central streaks to the feathers.

Obs. I cannot consider Mr. Swinhoe's Ketupa magnified to be 
distinct from K. Jlavipes; it seems to me to be identical in every 
respect. I subjoin the description which I made of the type of the 
former bird, most obligingly lent to me by Mr. Swinhoe. 

* Soft parts from Hodgson's original painting of type. 
1. KETUPA. 
Adult female (type of species). General colour tawny variegated 
with black, all the feathers of the upper surface centred with black, 
the head streaked with this colour; the dorsal feathers black, barred 
near the base and spotted near the tip with tawny; all these tawny 
markings very irregular in shape, and giving a mottled appearance 
to the whole of the upper surface; scapulars externally uniform 
tawny, some of them inclining to white on the outer web, and giving 
slight indications of a shoulder-patch; least wing-coverts black, 
slightly spotted with tawny, and hence appearing darker than the 
back, the greater and median series black, notched and barred with 
tawny, just like the back, the greater series whitish at tip; primary 
coverts blackish, tipped with tawny and crossed with two rows of 
tawny spots; quills blackish, with a broad terminal band of light 
brown, shading off into whitish, especially on the primaries, which 
are tipped with whitish only; all the quills barred or deeply notched 
with tawny on both webs, these not forming continuous bands across 
the feathers, but the spots or notches paler and more fulvous on the 
outer web, especially on the primaries, the notches on the secondaries 
often obscured with dusky brown shading; tail blackish, with 
pale tawny-coloured tip, and crossed with five other bands of 
deeper tawny colour; ear-tufts very long, measuring 3-25 inches, 

tawny in colour centred with black, the latter colour predominating 
on the outer feathers; lores pure white, with hair-like black shaft-
lines ; cheeks, ear-coverts, and sides of neck with black shaft-lines, 
broader on the latter; feathers just behind the eye black; chin 
white; the throat tawny, with very narrow black shaft-streaks, 
broader on the fore neck, which is again pure white; remainder of 
under surface clear tawny, all the feathers broadly centred with 
black streaks, the flanks and abdominal plumes indistinctly waved 
with lighter bars, the remains of faintly indicated lateral spots of 
buffy white; under tail-coverts narrowly centred with black; under 
wing-coverts deep tawny, the inner plumes and axillars with narrow 
blackish shaft-lines, the outer ones marked with black near the edge 
of the wing, which is white, the greater series dusky brown, tawny 
buff at base, thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which 
are blackish brown below, barred with pale tawny buff, more 
plainly on the inner web, which is entirely tawny buff at base; bill 
deep bluish black, lighter at the base, which is concealed by protruding 
feathers; inside of mouth pale yellowish flesh-colour; rim 
of eyelid deep purplish brown; iris fine orange-yellow; exposed 
portion of tarsus and toes dingy, with a tinge of clay-colour, yellowish 
on terminal scutes of toes; claws bluish black, fading to light 
leaden at their bases. Total length 25 inches, wing 18-8, tail 10*5, 
tarsus 3*1, feathered to within 1*1 inch of the base of toes. (Mus. M. 
Swinhoe.) 

Eab. Mngpo, China. 

Obs. Mr. Swinhoe has given an excellent description of this 
species, drawn from the birds as they lay in the flesh. My measurements 
are different from Mr. Swinhoe's, doubtless because they 
are taken from the skin. It will be better, therefore, to reproduce 

BUBONID/E. 

his detailed measurements, as they represent the natural size of the 
bird. "Measurements of the female. Length 25 inches; wing very 
much arched, across arc 16-75, pressed flat 17|, in rounded state 
3 inches short of tail-tip; 3rd to 6th primaries equal and longest; 
2nd 1-2 shorter than the same. Tail rounded, of twelve shortish 
hog-baeked feathers 9 | inches long; outer 0-75 shorter than centrals. 
Tarse 3*3 inches long, feathered with down for 2 inches in front, a 
little lower behind, and | inch less on sides. Middle toe 1*8, its 
claw 1-1; outer toe 1*5, its claw 1*05; inner toe 1*7, its claw 1*35 ; 
hind toe 1-2, its claw 1*1. The male has the tarse feathered in 
front to within 0*75 inch of where it meets the toes, at the back 
to 0-25. 

" The female looks rather larger than its mate, and is perhaps an 
inch longer; but I find no appreciable difference in the other measurements. 
The male has more white behind the ears, and a larger 
white breast-patch; and its tarse is plumed for a greater length; 
but the fine down with which it is clothed seems to wear off."

Adult. Above deep rufous bay, crossed with numerous irregular 
bars of black, fainter on the head, which is more Mvescent; wing-
coverts and entire wing bay barred with black, exactly like the 
back, the under surface of the wing rufous and barred exactly like 
the upper surface; tail rufous fawn-colour, rather lighter than back, 
banded across with black; under surface of body light bay, with 
distinct cordiform bars of black, somewhat irregular in shape; under 
wing-coverts rufous bay with a few black spots and bars, more 
distinct on the lower series, which are lighter, and resemble the 
inner lining of the wing; cere bluish lead-colour; bill similar to 
cere but darker, excepting towards tip; tarsi dirty white, tinged 
with bluish pink; talons light horn-colour with a tinge of dull 
blue; iris extremely dark brown. Total length 23*5 inches, culmen 
2-7, wing 16-5, tail 10, tarsus 2*7. 
Obs. The birds from the Zambesi are a little larger than the 
Gaboon example described above. They are, moreover, differently 
coloured underneath, being fulvous with longitudinal black shaft-
stripes and an occasional cordiform spot on the flanks; some of the 
breast-feathers with sub terminal black spots. As, however, this appearance 
is seen in Mr. Gurney's plate of a West-African bird (I. c), 
it is probatory not a specific character, but the sign of nonage.

of a whitish spot; primary coverts blackish, only slightly vermiculated 
with tawny; quills blackish, tipped narrowly with fulvous, 
and barred with tawny in about equal proportions to the black, the 
tawny bars not conterminous on the primaries, being much more 
dingy and shaded with blackish on the inner webs, the outer webs 
paler and clearer, the intermediate blackish markings very indistinct,

other feathers crossed with tawny bars not strictly conterminous, of 
which about four can be counted without including the pale terminal 
bar; lores whitish, as also the fore part of the cheeks, all the 
feathers with narrow blackish shaft-lines ; ear-coverts and sides of 
face tawny like the head, with the same blackish shaft-stripes, the

broadly streaked with black, these streaks linear near the base and 
dilating towards the tips, all the feathers more or less white at base 
and on their margins, giving a very whitish appearance to the chest, 
which disappears on the abdomen, only a few of the feathers of 
which are laterally whitish; vent and under tail-coverts tawny 
buff, only a few plumes mesially streaked with black; under wing-
coverts tawny buff, most of the feathers whitish at base, some of the 
outer ones with a few tiny marks of brown, the lower series blackish, 

fulvous at base, and thus resembling the inner lining of the wing,

feathers being of a dull tawny buff-colour, barred across with 
blackish. 

Adult mats. General colour above blackish, mottled and varied 
with yellowish tawny colour; head blackish, the tawny vermiculations 
being confined to the terminal margins and a few lateral bars 
on each side of the feather, so that the centre of the latter remains 
blackish; ear-tufts black, 3*2 inches long, excepting near the basal 
half of the inner web of the interior plumes, which are tawny buff, 
with narrow blackish vermiculations; nape and hind neck much 
paler than the crown, the feathers being for the most part tawny 
buff with broad black centres, from which spring on each side narrow 
black transvermiculating lines ; back again darker, the feathers being 
mostly black, the half-concealed bases tawny buff, vermiculated and 
irrorated coarsely with black; scapulars whitish externally or fulvous, 
sparingly transvermiculated with black, and forming an indistinct 
shoulder-patch; wing-coverts blackish, the least series very slightly 
varied with tawny buff, the median and greater series more frequently 
mottled with this character, the latter whitish at tip, with 
narrow irregular cross lines of black, forming an indistinct bar across 
the wing; primary coverts blackish, only slightly mottled with 
fulvous near the base of the outer web; quills dark brown, regularly 
barred with tawny buff, all the bars very minutely dotted with black 
on the outer web, the inner web for the most part tawny, most irregularly 
mottled with wavy lines, dots, and markings of black; the 
secondaries not so distinctly barred with tawny buff, all the lighter 
spots on the outer web obscured by minute spots and markings of 
dark brown, the inner webs much more plainly barred with tawny, 
none of these bars, however, being without brown vermiculations; 
the innermost secondaries blackish, mottled with fulvous all over, the 
tip whitish, as also of all the secondaries; lower back, rump, and 
upper tail-coverts more tawny than the back, the former coarsely 
barred, and the latter vermiculated with blackish, especially on the 
tail-coverts, which are whitish at tip; tail brown, the centre feathers 
vermiculated all round the margins with fulvous, and having three or 
four irregularly indicated bands, consisting of a few whitish spots of 

BTJBONlDiB. 

irregular shape *. all the other feathers more or less distinctly barred 
with deep tawny buff, the inner webs for the most part bright 
tawny, with irregular lines of blackish, more thickly distributed 
towards the tips of the feathers, which are here thickly though 
minutely spotted with brown, as are all the tawny bands on the outer 
webs• lores and feathers in front of and below the eye whitish, with 
narrow blackish shaft-lines ; above the eye a patch of black feathers; 
sides of face dull tawny, irrorated with narrow circular bars of 
brown; sides of neck coloured like the hind neck, but less strongly 
marked ; chin pure white, as also the fore neck, separated from each 
other by a narrow cordon of tawny feathers centred with black, and 
having small lateral bars of the same ; crop covered with tawny buff 
down, succeeded by a patch of white feathers in the centre of the 

breast; rest of under surface of body light tawny buff, most of the 
feathers with a slight glistening of silvery white, all of the chest-
feathers very broadly streaked down the centre with black, and 
likewise laterally spotted or barred with irregular lines of black, 
these central black streaks much narrower on the breast and abdomen, 
which are likewise very regularly, though narrowly, barred 
across with blackish ; under tail-coverts deep tawny, barred across 
with narrow lines of black ; leg-feathers deep tawny, with irregular 
transverse washings of blackish ; under wing-coverts tawny, the inner 
ones whitish, with narrow zigzag cross lines of black, the lower 
series brown, tawny at base; inner lining of wing dull brown, 
barred with tawny buff on inner web, most of the quills entirely 
tawny buff at base of the latter, more or less minutely speckled with 
brown; bill and claws blackish horn-colour; iris rich orange. Total 
length 26 inches, wing 18*6, tail 11*2, tarsus 3-2. 

Young female in first year's plumage (October 27th, 1872). Yery 
similar to the adults, and presenting few appreciable -differences many 
of the feathers of the upper surface glossed with silvery white, 
the light mottlings being larger on many of the dorsal feathers; 
middle tail-feathers more coarsely and distinctly mottled with whitish, 
affording indications of five ill-defined bars; upper wing-coverts 
much blacker than in the adult, with fewer transverse vermiculations. 
Total length 27 inches, wing 19-4, tail 11*5, tarsus 3*2. 

Obs. The descriptions are taken from Swedish specimens, carefully 
sexed and dated; and other specimens from the same country 
show very little differences. On the other hand, the two examples 
mentioned below from Archangel are much blacker on the upper 
surface generally, the head and neck very bright orange buff, with 
the usual broad black mesial streaks; the under surface of the body 
is also much paler. (Cf. also Dresser, B. Eur. I. c.)

Adult. General colour above pale tawny buff, many of the feathers 
inclining to whitish; head whitish, the feathers yellowish at base, 
all rather broadly centred with black, from which dark centres 
radiate irregular lines and spots of black; nape and hind neck light 
yellowish buff, many feathers whitish, all with broad black central 
streaks, the lateral lines or vermiculations very indistinct, in fact 
almost entirely absent; back blackish brown, yellowish buff at base, 
and shading off distinctly white in the centre of the feathers, all the 
lighter parts of the dorsal feathers narrowly waved and minutely 
barred or spotted with blackish; outer scapulars white on external 
webs, with only two or three narrow zigzag bars of blackish; wing-
coverts tawny buff, obscured by brownish mottlings thickly distributed 
over all the least series and the innermost of the median and 
greater series, the outermost of the median row uniform brownish 
black towards the tips, which more or less incline to white, most of 
the greater series having a large white spot at the tip of the outer 
web, which has very few and narrow cross lines of black; primary 
coverts blackish brown, irregularly mottled with yellowish buff on 
the outer webs; quills for the most part clear tawny buff, almost 
orange in intensity, the primaries dusky brown at tips, all the quills 
distinctly barred with darker brown, not quite conterminous, the 
yellow interspaces with nothing more than a few minute dots of 
brown; the secondaries more dusky than the primaries, the light interspaces 
being clouded with coarse brown vermiculations, especially 
towards the tip, the innermost secondaries very much clouded with 
brown mottlings, and distinctly barred across with blackish brown; 
lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts tawny buff, with a few indistinct 
wavy lines of blackish brown, rather more distinct and

strongly characterized on the upper tail-coverts; tail yellowish buff, 
whitish at tip, and regularly barred with dark brown, of which about 
eight bars (some partly broken up) can be distinguished on the outer 
feathers, the two centre ones more dusky than the rest, and crossed 
with six or seven bands of dusky brown, often much dissolved and 
mingled with the interspaces, which are thickly mottled and vermiculated 
with brown; lores and feathers round the eye white, the 
former black at the tip of the shafts*. just above the eye a patch of 
black feathers, continued to and appearing to form part of the ear-
tufts, which are 3*2 inches long, and black with tawny bases, the 
long feathers uniform yellowish buff on the inner web, and barred 
with black near the base of the outer; ear-coverts dull fulvous, 
with indistinct brown cross-barrings; chin pure white, the throat 
encircled by a row of slightly recurved feathers, yellowish buff, 
streaked down the centre with black, and also laterally barred with 
narrow lines of the same, exactly resembling the plumes on the 
sides of the neck, of which this gular band seems a continuation; 
rest of under surface white, slightly washed here and there with 
yellowish, the breast-feathers broadly streaked down the centre 
with black, all these feathers slightly varied with lateral vermiculations 
of brown, the central streaks reduced to a narrow shaft-line 
on the abdominal feathers and flanks, these being, however, finely 
but regularly barred across with dark brown, disappearing on the 
under tail-coverts ; crop covered with tawny down, succeeded by a 
patch of pure white feathers in the centre of the breast; leg-feathers 

buffy white, with a few remains of brown zigzag bars on the outer 
aspect; under wing-coverts pure white, here and there washed with 
yellowish, the outermost slightly marked with irregular lines of 
brown, the axillaries being also crossed with narrow lines of the 
same; lower series ashy brown, yellowish buff at base, forming a 
bar across the wing; inner lining of quills for the most part orange-
buff, with a few distinct brown bars on the inner web, disappearing 
towards the tip of the quills, which'are there dusky brown. Total 
length 26 inches, wing 19, tail 11-2, tarsus 3*4. 

Hob. Central Asia, from the Ural to Turkestan and Thibet; also 
said to occur in Siberia.

Obs. This bird, if not quite specifically distinct from B. ignavus, 
undoubtedly constitutes a well-marked race of that species. It is a 
very much paler bird both above and below, being especially white 
on the under surface, the cross-barrings on the abdominal plumes 
being much fewer and further apart; the legs also are covered with 
white feathers, which extend further on the foot and cover the 
junction of the toes and claws; the tail is different also—in I?. 
ignavus the two central feathers being brown, with faintly indicated 
bands of fulvous vermiculations, whereas in B. turcomanus the prevailing 
colour of these feathers is tawny buff, about eight cross bands 
of brown being distinguishable, while, instead of the lateral feathers

being barred with deep tawny and brown in about equal proportions, 
as in B. ignavus, in B. turcomanus these feathers are orange-buff, narrowly 
crossed with about eight bars of brown. The same differences 
are seen in the wing, the prevailing colour being orange-buff in the 
quiU-lining of B. turcomanus; in the under wing-coverts there is also 
a difference, these being barred across in B. ignavus like the breast, 
whereas in the Siberian Owl they are nearly uniform. The differences 
in the upper surface of the two birds chiefly consist in the 
entirely paler colour of B. turcomanus, the tawny buff colour predominating.

fusely vermiculated with ashy white in the form of zigzag cross 
markings; scapulars nearly entirely orange-buff on the outer web, 
inclining to white near the tip, and regularly crossed with rather 
narrow bars of brown, the tips being mottled with brown; head 
and neck, as mentioned above, more orange-buff than the back, the 
bases to the feathers showing very conspicuously, all of them 
blackish brown at tip, crossed with zigzag bars of ashy white; wing-
coverts blackish, especially the lesser series and those near the edge 
of the wing, these being only slightly vermiculated and barred with 
ashy white, the median and greater series more largely mottled with 
ashy white, the orange-buff bases to the feathers being also rather 
conspicuous, the greater series distinctly whitish at their tips, with 
several zigzag cross lines of brown; primary coverts regularly barred 
with dark brown and tawny buff in alternate bands, like the quills, 
the light bars slightly mottled with brown ; primaries dark brown 
barred with tawny buff, more broadly on the inner web, these bars 
slightly obscured with brown vermiculations, especially towards the 
tips of the feathers, the secondaries alternately barred with dark 
brown and tawny buff in about equal proportions, the light bars 
vermiculated with brown on the outer web, the innermost secondaries 
being brown strongly vermiculated with ashy white, and 
thus resembling the scapulars; lower back orange-buff, with a few 
zigzag cross markings of brown, increasing in extent on the rump 
and upper tail-eoverts, which are brown at their tips, vermiculated 
with ashy white like the rest of the back; tail dark brown, tipped 
with whitish and crossed with several zigzag lines of buffy white, 
indicating about seven bars on the middle feathers, inclining to buff 
near the base, the other feathers tawny buff on the inner web barred 
with brown, the outer web also alternately barred with brown and 
tawny buff, the external bars of this colour pretty clear on the outer 
feathers, but more or less clouded towards the centre of the tail; 
lores and feathers over the eye white, the shafts blackish at tip; 
plumes below the eye and ear-coverts tawny buff, the latter black 
at tip, forming a tolerably broad circular line down the sides of the 
neck; behind this black line a ruff of tawny feathers, whitish at 
tip, with a brown subterminal bar on the sides of the throat and 
cheeks, the feathers being very long and stiff, tawny buff with broad 
central streaks, these plumes continued across the throat, and separating 
the chin from the fore neck, both of the latter being pure 
white; rest of under surface of body white, thickly crossed with 
zigzag bars of blackish brown, all the bases to the feathers orange-
buff, showing conspicuously; the centre of the breast white; the 
chest and the sides of the upper breast with large spots of black; 
leg-feathers buffy whitish, washed with orange-buff; under tail-
coverts whitish, narrowly barred across with brown; under wing-
coverts white, scantily spotted with dark brown, those near the 
edge of the wing with rather larger brown spots, and inclining to 
bright orange-buff, the lowest series blackish with buffy white bases, 
resembling thus the inner lining of the quills, which are blackish 
brown barred with buffy white; ear-tufts 2-6 inches long, blackish

brown, tawny buff at base and for the greater part of the inner 

web• " bill black; toes ashy; claws horn-colour, black at ends; 

iris gamboge-yellow" (Ridgway). Total length 23 inches, wing 

14-9, tail 9, tarsus 2*3. 

Obs. The specimens from North America in the Museum not 

being sexed, I borrow the measurements given by Mr. Eidgway 

(t. c. p. 63). He gives those of the male as follows:—Wing 14*50, 
tail 8*20, culmen 1*10, tarsus 2, middle toe 2. 
Female. General appearance same as in the male. Black blotches 

on head above and nape less conspicuous, the surface being mottled 

like the back &c.; primary coverts with three well-delined, narrow, 

pure black bands; primaries with only six bands, these broader 

than in the male ; secondaries with only five bands; tail with but 

six dark bands, these very much narrower than the light ones. 

Tibiae and tarsi with sparse transverse bars of dusky. Wing 16, 

tail 9, culmen 1*20, tarsus 2*20, middle toe 2*10 (Ridgway). 

Mr. Ridgway gives nine dusky bars on the primaries of the male 
and eight on the secondaries, seven being the number on the tail-
feathers. Prom the sizes here given it appears that the example 
described by me (one of Mr. Doubleday's Delaware specimens) is a 
male. I can, however, only count seven dark bands on the primaries 
and six on the secondaries, while the tail has seven more or 
less distinct ones. Generally, however, as will be seen below, the 
bars are identical in number on both series of the quills, while not 
unfrequently the number on the tail-feathers corresponds also. 

The American Horned Owl varies greatly, and sometimes apparently 
these variations are coincident "with a different locality; but 
I do not think these differences are greater than those we are accustomed 
to see in B. ignavus of Europe. Generally speaking, specimens 
from British Columbia and Vancouver's Island are much 
darker than ordinary North-American examples, and belong to the 
race first separated by Mr. Cassin, and constituting the var. pacificus 
of MK Ridgway's recent work. He gives the range of this 
subspecies as the " Pacific coast north of the Columbia, Labrador/' 
and he calls it a " northern littoral form." We have in the Museum 
six specimens from the above-mentioned localities, on which I have 
made the following notes a propos of Mr. Ridgway's account:— 

a. S. West side of the Rocky Mountains (J. K. Lord). Total 
length 21 inches, wing 14*85, tail 9, tarsus 2-6. Bands on primaries 
and secondaries 7, bars on tail 7. 
b. £ . West side of the Rocky Mountains (J. K. Lord). Total 
length 20 inches, wing 14*85, tail 9, tarsus 2*45. Bands on primaries 
and secondaries 8, and on tail 8. The sex is probably an 
error in this specimen : they both agree with Mr. Ridgway's 
diagnosis as to the dark coloration of this race * but they have not 
the faoe " greyish •" for it is orange-buff barred with black. Both 
are very thickly barred with black below. 
c. Vancouver's Island (J. K. Lord). Total length 21 inches, 
•wing 15*4, tail 9*8, tarsus 2*75. Bars on primaries 8, and the same 
BTJBONIDiE. 

number on the secondaries and tail. Ear-coverts dull tawny shaded 
with grey and barred with black. 

d. Vancouver's Island (J. K. Lord). Total length 20 inches, 
wing 15*2, tail 9*5, tarsus 2*6. Bars on primaries, secondaries, 
and tail 6. 
e. Vancouver's Island (Dr. Lyall). Total length 21 inches, 
wing 14*7, tail 9, tarsus 2-45. Bars on secondaries 6, and on 
tail 7. It is impossible to count the bars on the primaries, as they 
are nearly all merged, producing a uniform surface below. 
/ . Vancouver's Island (Br. Lyall). Total length 21 inches, wing 
14-8, tail 9, tarsus 2-55. Bars on primaries and secondaries 6, and 
on tail 6. This bird is quite light-coloured compared with the 
foregoing specimens, and has a greyish face with a few black markings. 
In tone of colour it is not very different from Mr. B. Boss's 
bird from Port Simpson, but does not show the orange-buff bases to 
the feathers quite so much. 

These Paciiic-coast birds, as a rule, have the lower surface of the 
primaries nearly uniform brown; but these are also, perhaps in 
older birds, often as distinctly barred as in true B. virginianus. 

Mr. Bidgway separates as a race, equal in value to the subspecies 
he calls jpacificus, the pale form which Swainson named arcticus; 
and of this he gives the habitat as the " western region of North 
America, from the interior Arctic districts to the tablelands of 
Mexico." 

On this subspecies Dr. Coues's remarks should be studied (B. N.'W. 
Am. p. 301). 
I consider the type specimen to be nothing but a white variety of 

B. virginianus; but should it constitute a race, as Mr. Bidgway 
thinks, it will hold the same relation to Buho virginianus that B. 
turcomanus does to B. ignavus; but it is whiter in proportion. The 
type in the British Museum may be briefly described as follows :— 
General colour white, slightly tinged here and there with light 
orange-buff; all the upper surface mottled with zigzag cross markings 
of brown, rather broad and distantly vermiculated, the greater coverts 
white at tip of outer web; quills buffy white, with about six bars of 
dark brown on the outer web, the interspaces very slightly mottled 
with brown vermiculations, excepting at the tips of the primaries, 
which are very closely vermiculated with sandy brown, as also are 
the primary coverts at their extremities ; tail-feathers white, inclining 
to orange-buff on the inner web, and crossed with six regular 
though narrow bands of dark brown; lores and general facial aspect 
white, with silvery-white shaft-lines, the hinder margin of the ear-
coverts black; chin and fore neck pure white, separated from each 
other by a line of stiff feathers, which are white, with a broad mesial 
blackish streak; rest of under surface pure white, the leg-feathers 
and under tail-coverts immaculate, the breast irregularly spotted 
with blackish brown, the rest of the body very narrowly barred 
with the same; under wing-coverts pure white, the outermost of 
the lower series black at the tips, and forming a wing-spot which 
resembles the inner lining of the quills; bill and claws bluish 
3 . BUBO. 23 
black; iris yellow. Total length 20 inches, wing 14*9, tail 9-1, 

tarsus 2*6. 

Mr. Eidgway thinks it likely that Bubo arcticus is a Mexican bird, 
on the strength of Mr. Sclater's paper in Proc. -Zool. Soc. for 1860, 
where a specimen is recorded from Orizaba and named B. virginianus. 
I have seen two specimens from the valley of Mexico, whence they 
were received by M. A. Bouvier. The following notes refer to these 
birds:— 

a. Ad. Yalley of Mexico {Bouvier). Total length 20 inches, wing 
14-5, tail 8-4, tarsus 2-55. This bird is very grey, but does not seem 
to me to be more than an old B. virginianus. Ear-coverts dull buff, 
narrowly barred with blackish, and relieved with silvery white 
shaft-streaks on the fore part; bars on the primaries 8, on the secondaries 
7, and on the tail also 7. 
I. [Jim.]. Yalley of Mexico (Bouvier). Differs from all the Horned 
Owls of America which I have seen as yet by the broad character 
of the white markings on the under surface, so that the black 
bars are very distant. The character of the upper surface is also 
peculiar, the general colour being blackish, and the ashy white 
markings on the back, scapulars, and wing-coverts very broad and 
coarse* the tail is very dark, the bands eight in number, and much 
broader than usual; bands on primaries 8, on secondaries 7; ear-
coverts dull tawny buff, with a few indications of blackish cross 
lines. Total length 20 inches, wing 14*5, tail 9, tarsus 2*6. 
Mr. Salvin has kindly shown me a series of Central-American 
Horned Owls. They are chiefly from Guatemala, and belong to the 
ordinary North-American type, viz. B. virginianus. But in the 
Salvin-Gfodman Collection there is a remarkable bird from Ecuador, 
which is so black as to suggest the possibility of its being a case of 
melanism. It has so little left of the tawny colour and markings 
that I am unable to say whether it is a specimen of B. virginianus 
or B. magellanicus, though I should suspect that it would belong to 
the former species, if a permanent dark race or a distinct species 
should not be some day found to inhabit Ecuador.

Adult. General colour above clear tawny buff, varied with black 
markings occupying the centres and expanding towards the tips of 
tbe feathers, the tawny portion of which is distributed in lateral 
spots or notches, many of which incline to white, the bases of all 
the feathers being nearly entirely tawny buff; scapulars almost all 
tawny, with a large rounded white spot near the tip of the exterior 
feathers; the tips of the feathers blackish brown, with a few small 
bars of the same on both webs; head and neck tawny buff like the 
back, many of the feathers ineHning to whitish at tip, with broad 
dark brown centres, less characterized on the hind neck, which 
therefore appears more tawny than the rest of the upper surface; 
wing-coverts tawny buff like the back, with the same central markings 
of brown, the tawny colour more distributed in spots than on 
the back, many of them inclining to white, especially on the outer 
webs of the median and greater series, which have quite an ocellated 
appearance, all the least wing-coverts and those bordering the 
outside of the wing darker brown and less spotted with tawny than 
the rest of the coverts ; wing-coverts nearly uniform brown, inclining 
to tawny buff only at base and on the lower half of the inner web ; 
quills tawny buff, tipped narrowly with buffy white, the primaries 
brown at tip and broadly barred with brown, the tawny interspaces 
nearly three times the width of the brown cross bars, the secondaries 
much more dusky, being more numerously barred with brown, the 
tawny buff interspaces about double the width of the brown bands, 
and much obscured with vermiculations of brown, the innermost 
mottled with tawny buff and brown and resembling the back; lower 
back, rump, and upper tail-coverts nearly uniform tawny buff, with 
a few brownish mottlings, in the form of bands near the extremity 
of the latter; tail-feathers tawny buff, tipped with buffy white, and 
crossed with about Hye distinct bands of darker brown on the outer 
feathers, the basal bands obsolete on these, but more distinct on the 
others, which have about seven distinguishable, the two centre 

3 . BUBO. 25 
feathers much more dusky, the dark bands being broader and about 
nine in number, the tawny buff interspaces obscured by mottlings of 
brown; lores and feathers in front of the eye white, with dusky 
blackish tips* feathers over the eye black, forming a small spot; 
ear-tufts about 1*75 inch Jong, tawny buff, with a black mesial mark 
towards the tip; sides of face and ear-coverts uniform tawny buff, 
the latter blackish at their tips, forming a circular Hne of black down 
the sides of the head, succeeded by a ruff of tawny buff feathers, 
inclining to whitish on the lower margin of the ear-coverts, these 
feathers mesially streaked with black, a small patch of which is also 
seen behind the lower part of the ear-coverts on the sides of the 
neck ; cheeks and chin white, as also a patch on the fore neck, this 
latter separated from the chin by a patch of stiff feathers tawny buff 
with black central streaks ; under surface of body bright tawny buff, 
broadly streaked with brown on the chest, the breast less distinctly 
streaked, the markings being mere longitudinal spots, many of the 
feathers being laterally white; belly crossed with numerous narrow 
zigzag bars of rufous brown, many of the interspaces being white, 
these narrow bars disappearing on the under tail-coverts • leg-feathers 
uniform buffy white*, under wing-coverts tawny, more or less washed 
with white, the inner ones especially whitish, those near the edge of 
the wing rather minutely spotted with black, the lower series dark 
brown, white at the base, thus resembling the inner lining of the 
quills, which are whitish on the inner web, with broad brown bars; 
bill black; iris deep yellow. Total length 21 inches, wing 15-8, 

tail 9-5, tarsus 3*15.

sides of the face, this line being succeeded by a ruff of pale tawny 
buff feathers, with broad central streaks of dark brown, these showing 
very distinctly on the lower part; head and neck much lighter 
than the back, the general colour being bright tawny buff, streaked 
broadly down the centre of each feather with blackish brown, many 
of the plumes of the wing inclining to whitish buff near their tips; 
ear-tufts 2-25 inches long, black, narrowly margined on the outer 
web, but broadly on the inner one, with yellowish buff; chin

breast, which have also tolerably distinct central streaks of brown, 
the under tail-coverts fulvous, less distinctly barred; leg-feathers 
uniform fulvous; under wing-coverts tawny buff, slightly barred 

3 . BUBO. 27 
with, narrow markings of brown, the outermost rather largely spotted 
with brown, the lower series fulvous at base, brown at tip, forming 
a wing-bar, thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are 
fulvous, barred with brown on the inner web; bill horny black; 
irides intense orange-yellow. Total length 20 inches, wing 15-6, 
tail 8*8, tarsus 2-95. 

Obs. On looking over the series of Bubo bengalensis, I was struck 
with the variation in colour which is exhibited by the species. Some 
specimens are very black in comparison with others; and these I 
cannot make out to be immature. Himalayan examples are generally 
more dusky about the face than those from other parts of India; 
and one presented by Mrs. Hillier is remarkable for its tawny appearance. 
In this stage it comes exceedingly close to Bubo asea-
Icuphus ; and indeed these two species are scarcely separable; a 
comparison of a large series might even prove their absolute identity; 
but we have in the Museum only two specimens from Egypt. They 
are more ocellated in appearance than the Indian birds, especially 
below, where the light markings are very broad and arranged in the 
form of spots, while the transverse bars are much narrower in B. 
bengalensis.

* This specific name is generally credited to Daudin, who founded his Strix

bengalensis; hut the question is too obscure to admit of our substituting for the 
latter well-established title the older, but totally inapplicable, one of capensis 
tor an Indian bird. The synonymy of this doubtful Cape species is as 
follows:—

brown bases and indistinct cross bars of the same; chin white, as 
also the fore neck, separated from each other by a bar across the 
throat, consisting of tawny feathers mesially streaked with brown ; 
crop-patch composed of fluffy dull white feathers, inconspicuously

the broadest, and often nearly white; under tail-coverts whitish, 
barred across with brown, much more narrowly than the breast; leg-
feathers whitish, the tibial plumes tawny, with very few zigzag 
markings of brown; under wing-coverts pure white, plainly crossed 
with zigzag bars of brown, the lower series yellowish white for basal 
half, barred with brown, the apical half being entirely brown, forming 
a wing-bar. and resembling the inner lining of the quills, which 
are yellowish white on inner web, broadly barred with dark brown;

M. Jules Verreaux, in a note communicated to Dr. Hartlaub (Orn. W.-Afr. 
p. 19) says that this species is the same as B. maculostis (V.); and Professor 
Sundevall, in his critique on Levaillant (p. 27), agrees with this, and says he 
has seen the type in the Leyden Museum. Prof. Schlegel, however, does not 
mention this in his ' Catalogue;' and I do not consider the plate in Levaillant's 
work sufficiently decisive to upset the better-known title of Vieillot's.

Nestling. Covered with long and fluffy feathers, of a dull brownish 
white colour, with indistinct bars of dull brown, on the head and 
tinder surface of the body; feathers of the upper surface light 
brown, barred and mottled with darker brown, the wing-coverts 
ocellated on both webs with yellowish buff; these as well as the scapulars 
broadly tipped with whitish, causing a distinctly mottled 
appearance. 

Adult female. Above dark brown, strongly mottled and vermiculated 
with fulvous, the markings somewhat coarser on the scapulars, 
which have on their outer webs large spots of white, separated from 
each other by a narrow brown bar, and giving a distinctly ocellated 
appearance; wing-coverts light brown, slightly mottled with fulvous, 
the median and greater series distinctly ocellated with white 
on outer webs, the primary coverts also marked with white externally 
; quills pale brown, narrowly tipped and rather broadly barred 
with buffy white, all the bars more or less vermiculated with brown, 
the bars on the outer primaries white and very broad, all of them 
very distinct below; upper tail-coverts brown, irregularly barred 
with white; tail brown, tipped with whitish, and crossed with four 
bands of light fulvous, all the interspaces and the tips more or less 
mottled with brown vermiculations, the centre feathers with no 
distinct cross bars, but much vermiculated with fulvous on the outer 
margins; crown of head and ear-tufts deep brown spotted with 
white, and producing a barred appearance on the latter and on the 
hind neck, very conspicuous on the neck, which has also large ocellated 
spots of white; lores white, tipped with black: sides of face 
and ear-coverts white, barred with brown, the latter tipped with 
black, forming a ring; feathers of facial ruff white at base, dark 
brown at tip; sides of face white, narrowly barred with brown; * w 
chin whitish; throat brown, notched on both webs with fulvous; I on 
the lower throat a conspicuous patch of white; rest of under 
surface of body white barred narrowly with brown and freckled 
(especially on the sides of the body) with pale rufous brown; the 
tarsal feathers whitish, with very few indications of brown cross

bars, which, are, however, very distinct on the under tail-coverts; 
under wing-coverts white, narrowly barred with brown, as also are 
the axillaries; bill black; iris yellow. Total length 21 inches, 
culmen 1*8, auricular tufts 2*4, wing 13*4, tail 7*7, tarsus 3*1. 

Obs. Some specimens are not mottled with white but with rufous 
buff, and have consequently a* more rufescent appearance; but it 
appears that the species gets darker and more uniform with age, 
especially on the upper surface and the sides of the face. 

Hab. The whole of South Africa, ranging as high as the Zambesi 
on the east coast, and to Benguela on the west.

under surface of body white, the chin and a patch on the lower 
throat pure white, the remainder of the body barred with brown, 
more broadly on the chest, which therefore assumes a dusky appearance 
; the flanks, sides of the body, and under tail-coverts washed 
with yellowish; under wing-coverts white, narrowly barred with 
brown, more coarsely on the outermost, the lower series white

washed with rufous, vermiculated and waved on the upper surface 
with darker grey; head and ear-tuffcs smoky, varied with pale 
rufous; iris rufous umber.

Obs, Specimens of this Owl from South Africa are often regarded 
as belonging to a different species, which is called Bubo, or Huhua, 
verreauxi. Mr. Gurney has argued in favour of their recognition as 
distinct species: and he gives the following measurements in support 
of his plea (Ibis, 1868, p. 148):—

I cannot, however, see more in these differences than the usual 
slight increase of size exhibited by Sonth-African birds over examples 
of the same species from more northern localities. I therefore 
unite these two titles under one species, and give the measurements 
of the series now before me:—

Young. General colour white, somewhat washed with yellow hei\ 
and there, and barred with broad markings of dark brown, sometimes 
heart- and sometimes spade-shaped on the back, less prominent 
and narrower on the head; sides of face dull white, washed with 
brown; under surface of body whitish, barred across with pale 
brown, these bars much darker on the under wing-coverts; wing& 
and tail coloured much as in the adult, the former with many white 
feathers barred with brown like the back (the remains of young 
plumage), the tail with remains of seven fulvous bars besides the 
white tip; toes bare, with a few bristly feathers sprouting. 

Adult. Above brown, narrowly tipped and banded across with 
tawny buff over the whole of the upper surface, these bars less 
distinct on the crown, but broader and deeper-coloured on the hind 
neck; the light-coloured bars broader and coarser on the scapu-

I cannot speak positively on the species; but if distinct, the synonymy will be 
as follows:— 
BUBO PECTORALIS.

Mr. Hume, however, speaks with great certainty on the subject of the Ceylon 
bird:—"Whether H. pectoralis (Jerdon) be, or be not, a good species I cannot 
yet positively affirm, because I have hitherto failed to procure a Mlghiri or 
Malabar specimen; but the Ceylon bird, of which I have a very fine specimen 
now before me, is no more distinct from Huhua nipalensis than Ketupa ceylonensis 
of Ceylon is distinct from that of Northern India. H. nipalensis is, I 
believe, a rare bird in European collections; but I have carefully examined 
some ten specimens, five of which are now in my collection, and I find that, 
even as regards size, there is no such marked difference between the Ceylonese 
and Nepaulese birds. In two males before me from Nepaul, the wings vary 
from 16 to 16*5 inches, in the females from 17"5 to 18'5 inches ,* in a supposed 
male from Ceylon the wing is 16*75 inches. 

" As regards plumage, the bird is one that varies very greatly; if there is a 
difference, the Nepaulese birds are rather darker; as for the so-called pectoral 
band, which merely depends on the breadth of the subterminal bars on the 
breast-feathers, this apparently depends upon age, and I have a Nepaulese bird 
in which the so-called pectoral band is a great deal more marked than in the 
very fine Ceylon specimen before me; while I have another Nepaulese bird, a 
young male, I believe, in which there is scarcely a trace of this band. The 
Ceylon bird may, I think, be referred to K nipalensis; and this being the fact, I 
think it extremely doubtful whether the Malabar and Nilghiri birds will prove 
distinct." *

Range* The whole of the Old World excepting the extreme north ; 
absent also in Australia and Oceania, but probably present in New 
Zealand. The whole of the New "World, excepting the extreme 
southern portion of South America. 

Obs. Difficult to understand as all Owls are, the species of the 
genus Scops are in every way the most difficult to identify. The 
impossibility of procuring series of*some of the species to study at 
the same time, the absence of information as to the sequence of 
plumages from the young stage to that of the adult, and the puzzling 
way in which some species seem to possess rufous phases, while 
others do not—these are all problems which time alone can solve. 
Thanks to many kind friends, I have been able to compare with 
the series in the Museum the specimens of Scops Owls in the private 
collections of Lord Walden, Messrs. Salvin and Godman, Mr. 
Swinhoe, and Captain Shelley, as well as many of the rare species 
contained in the Norwich Museum. These advantages have, I 
trust, not been without some benefit in my studies of these difficult

Adult (type of species). Upper surface brown, very minutely vermiculated 
with darker brown, sometimes forming an irregular spot, and yaried with a few 
wavy lines of dull fulvous, rather brighter and more ochraceous on the outer 
margin of the scapulars, where the alternate bars of dark brown and fulvous are 
a little more regular; greater wing-coverts mottled with ashy grey, especially 
towards the tips ; primaries darker brown, externally notched with fulvous, these 
marks tolerably distinct, except towards the tips, where they are obscured by 
greyish mottling, the secondaries more ashy brown, mottled profusely with darker 
brown and with indications of five lighter and more fulvous bars across them ; 
under surface of wing uniform brown, with slight ashy mottlings towards the 
tip, the under wing-coverts almost entirely ochraceous, this shade extending some 
way along the inner web of the quills, which are also barred with greyish brown; 
tail brown, mottled with darker brown, with indications of seven fulvescent 
bands; crown and hind neck, as well as sides of face and ear-tufts, darker brown 
than the back; lores and ear-coverts rufescent; an indistinct superciliary line 
indicated by fulvous mottling, which also appears on the inner webs of the ear-
tufts ; round the hind neck a narrow collar produced by fulvous mottling; under 
surface of body rufous ochre, becoming paler and more fulvous on the abdomen, 
thighs, and under tail-coverts; feathers of lower breast mesially streaked with 
blackish brown, a little varied with whitish, and mottled with darker brown ; 
the throat and chest blacker, much mottled with irregular wavy lines of this 
colour, especially on the sides of the breast. Total length 10 inches, culmen 
0 85, wing 7, tail 3*8, tarsus 1*2, middle toe &8, ear-tufts 1-1. (Mus. Lugd.) 

Professor Schlegel ('Bevue,' p. 13) says that it is to be distinguished from all 
the other Scops Owls by the " absence of light spots on the scapulars. The upper 
parts are very dark, the top of the head being brownibh black; nape ornamented 
with a band of rufous feathers, vermiculated with black, and followed bv a black 
collar."

birds ; and I cannot sufficiently thank those gentlemen who have 
aided me by the loan of specimens, especially Mr. Allan Hume, 
who has sent over from India beautiful series of all the Indian 
Scops Owls as determined by him, thus enabling me to make out 
several species which must otherwise have been uncharacterized in 
the present work. 

I can hardly expect that all ornithologists will acquiesce in my 
views as to the subspecies or races which I have believed it to be my 
duty to recognize. These races do exist in nature, and they may be 
called by whatever name naturalists please, " varieties," " races,'' 
" subspecies," " climatic forms," &c.; but it has seemed to me better 
to keep these forms, many of which are very well characterized, 
distinct from one another, than to merge them all as one species, and 
thus to obliterate all records of natural facts, which are plain enough 
to the practised eye of the ornithologist, though difficult to describe 
in words. As will be seen below, the series in the Museum is very 
fine, and nearly all the variations mentioned in the present work can 
be examined by any one wishing to test the validity of my conclusions. 


I have also deemed it more suitable to separate in the diagnostic 
tables the species of the Old World from those of the New, as the 
facies of the Scops Owls from the American continent is very different 
from that of the Old-World species, and can hardly lead to their being 
confounded one with, another. There appear to be only two representative 
species, as follows;— 

Old World. New World. 

Scops giu. Scops flammeola. 
Scops semitorques. Scops Jcennicotti. 


These are, however, very easily distinguishable as species, though 
belonging to the same groups.

Adult male. Above grey, washed here and there with orange- or 
sandy buff; on the crown the latter colour prevails, all the feathers 
being mesially streaked with black, and varied with very minute 
wavy lines of brown; the ear-tufts externally sandy brown, greyish 
on the inner webs, and varied with cross markings of white, so that 
when the tufts are erect there is a continuous- line of grey from 
above the eye on each side of the forehead, the feathers of the latter 
situated above the eye being greyish; across the back of the head 
an indistinct greyisb line of feathers, many of them being spotted 
with white on both webs; hind neck decidedly greyer than the 
back, most of the feathers being greyish, white with very few wavy 
lines of brown, the dark shaft-streaks also less distinctly indicated; 
general aspect of the back grey, but washed with orange-buff on 
the interscapulary region, and with deep sandy buff on the inner 
line of the scapulars, all the feathers minutely vermiculated with 
dark brown, the blackish shaft-streaks also strongly pronounced, 
and many of the dorsal and scapular feathers varied with indications 
of whitish bars; the outer web of the scapulars white or fulvous, 
broadly tipped with black, and forming a tolerably distinct shoulder-
patch ; wing-coverts coloured like the back, the least ones darker, 

the brown centres of the feathers showing more distinctly, the median 
and greater series largely spotted with white on the outer web; 
primary coverts rather darker than the others, being brown, mottled 
with dull sandy buff, the outer ones externally notched with fulvous; 
quills brown on their concealed inner webs, but greyish externally, 
harmonizing with the general colour of the bird, being minutely 
vermiculated like the back; innermost secondaries greyish, with 
narrow blackish shaft-streaks, the outer ones indistinctly barred 
with fulvousj the primaries more distinctly, these light bars on the 
outer web shading into pure white externally, and producing a very 
marked chequered appearance, all the bars less distinct at the tips

mottled with brownish vermiculations, and irregularly barred with 
fulvous, these bars being rather more distinct and whiter on the outer 
feathers; lores whitish, the shafts elongated and blackish at tip ; 
over the fore part of the eye a few white feathers terminally margined 
with blackish; sides of face grey, with a few indistinct dusky 
cross lines, the ear-coverts slightly washed with sandy colour, more 
particularly below the eye; behind the ear-coverts a crescentic band 
of black feathers extending below on to the sides of the neck, all 
these plumes whitish or fulvous at base; chin whitish; throat and 
sides of neck clear grey, finely vermiculated with brown cross lines, 
and slightly washed with orange-buff, the shafts of the feathers 
distinctly black; all the rest of the under surface greyish, strongly 

-washed with orange-buff on parting the feathers, all of which have 
black shaft-lines, broader on the flanks; the breast and sides of 
body lighter than the chest by reason of whitish bars on most of 
them; the lower flanks and under tail-coverts white, crossed with 
one or two sandy buff bars, the narrow linear vermiculations nearly 
absent; leg-feathers orange-buff, with a few minute bars of brown; 
under wing-coverts buffy white, slightly streaked and barred with 
brown, the lower series ashy brown, broadly barred with whitish on 
the inner web, and resembling the inner lining of the quills; bill 
black; toes brown; claws white at base, nearly black at tip ; iris

The Morocco birds are rather smaller than the French, and differ 
from the Dauphine example described in having much broader dark 
central streaks to the breast-feathers; but the Spanish birds agree 
better with the North-African ones. One of the latter seems to bo 
a younger bird, and is remarkable for the coarseness of its markings 
both above and below, and for the distinctness of the light bands on 
the tail, six being distinguishable on the centre rectrices besides the 
terminal band of buff; the same number can be traced on the tails 
of the adult ones, but they appear to get dissolved with age. Old 
birds may also apparently be detected by the great extent of white 
on the under surface, occupying the fore neck and chest, which are 
then very slightly barred with zigzag brown lines; the hind neck 
also is broadly barred with white. The oldest example before me 
appears to be that from Asia Minor, which exhibits in the strongest 
degree the above-mentioned characters, and has only five fulvous 
bars on the middle tail-feathers, besides the light terminal bar. The 
Dauphine specimen has only four candal bands distinguishable on 
these feathers, and is probably of about the same age as the one 
from Asia Minor. Both are males: and the small number of tail-
bands is perhaps a character of this sex; for the male from Granada 
has only five, while the Safed bird has seven. 

Great variation exists in the amount of rufous shading on specimens 
from the same locality; but I have never met with one which 
could be said to constitute a regular rufous phase, such as we know 
to exist in Scops asio of America. A French specimen collected by 
Mr. Swainson is in the Cambridge Museum, and nearly equals in intensity 
the type of Scops 1-amtscJiatJcensis in the Paris Museum.
carefully compared this with ordinary European examples, and can 
affirm with certainty that it is nothing but a more than ordinarily 
rufous Scops giu; no authority for its Kamtschatkan habitat exists 
beyond the assertion of the late M. Jules Yerreaux. In order to 
make sure of the identity of these birds, I give the description which 
I made from the Paris specimen. 

Adult female (Kamtschatka; obtained from Yerreaux, 1847). 
General colour orange-rufous, varied with blackish vermiculations, 
some of the feathers also having a central arrow-shaped streak of 

4. SCOPS. 51 
black, these black markings much more distinct on the crown, but 
less so on the ear-coverts (0*9 inch long), the latter being paler 
orange than the rest of the upper surface, and for the most part 
uniform on the inner web; facial aspect grey, washed with orange-
rufous above the eye and behind the ear-coverts, vermiculated crosswise 
with brown; the lores white with blackish shafts washed with 
orange; under surface of body whitish, the chest and sides washed 
with orange-rufous, all the feathers minutely vermiculated with 
ashy brown, a few of the chest-feathers with broad mesial streaks 
of black, narrower on the flanks, the markings disappearing on the 
under tail-coverts, which are almost entirely white, with only a few 
transverse vermiculations of greyish brown; legs whitish, inclining 
to orange at the summit of the tarsus, which has a few transverse 
markings of brown; under wing-coverts yellowish buff, as also the 
axillaries, the outermost washed with orange and spotted with 
brown, the lower series fulvous at base, greyish brown at tip, resembling 
the inner lining of the wing, which is ashy brown, barred 
with buffy white on the inner webs of the quills; upper wing-
coverts a little duller than the back, the transverse vermiculations 
very indistinct, but the central streaks plain, the greater coverts 
with a few white spots on the outer web, in this respect resembling 
the scapulars, which are more coarsely transvermiculated with brown 
than the back, and have white spots on the outer web, w7hich is 
otherwise orange at base; primary coverts dull orange-brown, vermiculated 
with greyish brown; quills brown, orange on the outer 
web, and irregularly vermiculated with greyish brown; the primaries 
barred with lighter brown on the inner web, this bar being 
represented on the outer one by a bar of white more or less tinged 
with orange, the interspaces orange-brown, with darker brown vermiculations; 
the secondaries decidedly greyer than the primaries 
and more minutely vermiculated; upper tail-coverts resembling the 
back; tail darker brown, barred with orange, of which about five 
bands can be distinguished, becoming more distinct towards the tip, 
where they are obscured by the greyish vermiculations of the interspaces 
; bill horn-colour. Total length 6-7 inches, wing 5*8, tail 3, 
tarsus 1*05. 

In the Paris Museum there is another specimen marked as from 
Kamtschatka, and absolutely identical with ordinary European 
specimens. 

Another supposed closely allied species is the Scops senegalensis 
of Swainson, which must next be inquired into. On this bird Dr. 
j?insch (Tr. Z. S. vii. p. 210) writes;—" The African Scops agrees 
in every respect with our European S. zorca [~giu of this work], 
except in the shorter wings, this being, as far as I could find out, a 
permanent character, common also to specimens from the west and 
north-east as well as to those from the south (Stria latijpennis, Licht.). 
I do not hesitate to regard this peculiarity as of specific value." I 
have before me specimens from Africa, the measurements of which 
I give, in order to test the above-mentioned character:—

It will be seen by the above measurements that Dr. Finsch was 
quite right in his facts about the smaller size of the African bird; 
but the plumage of the Senegal Scops is not distinguishable from 
that of European birds, and I cannot allow the distinctness of S. 
senegalensis as constituting any thing more than a slightly smaller 
race of 8. giu. I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Salvin for 
submitting to me the type of Scops senegalensis of Swainson, which 
is the first bird mentioned in the above table of measurements. 

The South-African birds, however, are different from S. giu, being 
so extremely dark in colour, as well as of such a small size; but 
they can hardly be regarded as constituting more than a dark race, 
though the characters appear pretty constant. The true 8. capensis 
occurs in IsT.E. Africa, as Lord Walden has kindly lent me the 
example collected by Mr. Jesse during the Abyssinian expedition, 
and referred to by Dr. Einsch (?. c). Dr. von Heuglin also considers 
that both forms occur in S".E. Africa, 8. giu being a winter 
visitor to Egypt, while 8. capensis he believes to be a resident in 
the warmer parts of JST.E. Africa (cf. Heugl. Orn. N.O.-Afr. i. 

p. 118).

Similar to 8. giu, but of a very dark grey colour, and distinguished 
by its grey ear-coverts; the ear-tufts for the most part rufous ochre, 
and not mottled with white as in European examples. Three 'Nepaulese 
specimens in the Museum measure as follows :— 

with quadrangular spots of white on the outer webs; tail pale cinereous, with 
irregular transverse bars of brown, and exhibiting a different style of colouring 
from either of the species above mentioned; tarsi nearly white, obscurely spotted 

with brown.

The characters above given do not seem to me to distinguish the species from 
JS. capensis; but as Mr. Cassin had adult and young specimens of the latter bird 
before him at the time he wrote the description of 8. hendersom, I have not 
united the two, preferring to wait for further evidence.

Obs. Mr. Hodgson's drawings show, even if specimens bearing* his 
numbers and original tickets did not exist to prove the fact, that 
his Scops pennatus embraced two very distinct species, viz. the bird 
now named by every one 8. pennatus and the species afterwards 
called 8. spilocephalus by Blyth. 8. pennatus is therefore a composite 
species, the type of which would be difficult to determine; but 
as Blyth has separated the spotted bird it remains to allot to the 
grey Scops Owl of the Himalayas the title of pennatus. By its dark 
coloration the Indian bird approaches 8. capensis, but differs from it 
and from 8. gin by the possession of a very distinct rufous phase 
(not, however, to be confounded with 8. sunia). Mr. Hume has 
kindly lent me the rufous bird figured by him in his new work on 
the Ornithology of India; and I think that every one will admit that 
such a rufous bird was never seen in Europe.

Adult General colour above ashy brown, mottled with numerous 
blackish cross-vermiculations, the whole of the upper surface varied 
with central spots or cross bars of pale yellowish buff, much broader 
on the hinder neck, and forming there a tolerably distinct collar; 
some of the feathers of the head blackish in the centre* and nearly 
all of them spotted with pale buff, most of the shafts being of the 
latter colour; ear-tufts (0-85 inch long) marked and spotted like 
the crown, the bases to the feathers pale yellowish buff, extending 
for the greater part of the inner web; scapulars as distinctly barred 
with yellowish buff as the hind neck, the outer webs of external 
ones white, with a distinct terminal bar of blackish brown, some of 
the feathers slightly tinged with yellowish buff; wing-coverts rather 
more rufous than the back and distinctly spottod with tawny buff, 
the median and greater series slightly washed with grey and less 
thickly vermiculated with brown, the median series distinctly barred 
with whitish, large spots of which are apparent at the tips of the 
outer median and greater coverts, the spurious quills externally 
notched with white; primary coverts brown, vermiculated with 
sandy buff, and distinctly barred across with the same colour, so as 

4. SCOPS. 55 
to exactly resemble the secondaries, which are barred in the same 
manner externally, the inner webs barred with paler brown, shading 
off into yellowish white on the interior margin of the quills; the 
primaries externally notched or barred with white, giving a very 
distinct chequered appearance to the onter aspect of the wing, all 
the tips of the feathers barred with sandy buff, many of the darker 
bars dissolving and breaking up into mottliugs and vermieulations; 
the innermost secondaries coloured like the back with concealed bars 
of yellowish buff, and barred with whitish near the tips of the 
feathers ; tail brown, the dark bars varied with sandy buff vermiculations, 
all the feathers very distinctly crossed with bars of the-
same colour, inclining to white near the tips, about six bands being 
distinguishable on the centre feathers, these being a little more 
distinct on the exterior rectrices, the outermost of which are notched 
with white; loral plumes whitish at base, black at tips, the shaft-
lines produced into long black hair-like bristles ; feathers over the 
eye buffy white, with narrow subterminal zigzag lines of brown, and 
the inner webs also brown, so that the superciliary line is not at all 
distinct; behind the upper part of the eye some dusky brown feathers ; 
ear-coverts dusky grey, clouded with blackish cross markings; behind 
the ear-coverts an indistinct ruff of orange-buff feathers, tipped with 
brownish black, the plumes adjoining the throat being also orange-
buff, but finely barred with dark brown; chin-feathers buffy white; 
rest of under surface dull greyish, washed here and there with pale 
orange-buff, some of the feathers distinctly streaked down the centre 
with blackish brown, and all more or less distinctly waved with 
narrow zigzag lines of brown; the chest crossed with many distinct 
bars of whitish, these bars predominating on the abdomen, where 
the cross lines are more scanty and the whitish colour prevails, the 
flank-feathers having irregular cross bars of orange-buff, and being 
only vermiculated with brown dots at the tip, these markings being 
still more scanty on the under tail-coverts, which are to a great 
extent white; leg-feathers buffy white, streaked with brown; under 
wing-coverts buffy whitish, those near the edge of the wing brown, 
mottled and barred with sandy buff, the lower series pale ashy 
brown, sandy buff at base, and resembling the inner lining of the 
wing, which is ashy brown, very broadly and distinctly banded with 
yellowish white on the inner web; bill horn-brown, the lower 
mandible yellowish; feet probably fleshy brown in life. Total 
length 7%5 inches, wing 5*5, tail 2*85, tarsus 0*95. 

Obs. This little Owl belongs to the same group as S. giu, and is 
quite different in appearance, without giving very tangible characters 
for specific separation. Its general colour is ashy brown above, 
without any greyish shade; the ear-coverts dusky grey; the collar 
Tound the neck is very indistinct, and is represented by certain pale 
buff-coloured bars or spots without any appearance of white whatsoever 
; on the back, however, are several very distinct spots and 
bars of the same pale buff-colour, giving a very marked character 
to these peculiarities. The specimen which I have described is 
said to be from, China, and presented to the Museum by Mr. J. E, 

BTIBONID-E. 

Reeves. The same subspecies Is found iu Camboja, and even extends 
to jNTcpaul, specimens from both these localities being in the British 

Museum. 

The typical specimen is said to be from China, whence also I have 
seen two other specimens in Mr. Swinhoe's collection, which I am 
inclined to refer to 8. sthtonotm. One from Amoy (8. baJckamcena, 
Swinhoe, Ibis, 1800, p. 47) is certainly the same; and another from 
Chefoo (8. swiia, Swinhoe, Ibis, 1874, p.* 433) must also be the 
same, I think, although there is rather more white on the eyebrow 
and under surface of the body, and the ear-coverts are paler grey 
than in the typical bird. The fulvous collar, however, is present, 
and the bars on the dorsal plumage are very distinct. I give 
measurements of the other specimens examined by me:—

rather darker than the back, and washed with dull orange-buff, most 
of the feathers being laterally spotted with this colour and conspicuously 
black in the centre; on the nape a faintly indicated 
greyish band, some of the feathers being subterminally barred with 
white, the hind neck darker, but the interseapulary region varied 
with orange-buff bases to the feathers, slightly washed with grey, 
the plumes also much mottled with spots of white; ear-tufts 1*1 inch 
long, orange-buff for the greater part of the inner web and at the

primaries, giving a chequered appearance to the outer aspect of the 
wing, the innermost secondaries vermiculated and exactly resembling 
the back ; tail dull brown, very coarsely mottled with blackish zigzag 
lines, all the tips being vermiculated in this manner, the outer 
feathers crossed with about eight tolerably distinct lighter bars of

distinctly streaked down the middle with black, these streaks much 
narrower on the lower breast and flanks, all the feathers more or less 
coarsely vermiculated with zigzag cross lines of dark brown, and irregularly 
spotted or barred with greyish white, these white bars 
increasing much in width on the flanks and abdomen ; under tail-
coverts white, slightly washed with rufous, and minutely freckled 
near the tip with brown vermiculations; leg-feathers tawny, with 
small cross bars of dark brown ; under wing-coverts whitish, excepting 
those near the edge of the wing, which are rufescent, slightly 
marked with brown ; the greater series ashy brown, yellowish white

Obs. Of the same group as S> giu, but a much larger and browner 
bird, so that, with the faintly indicated occipital bars and the buff 
variations of the hind neck, it somewhat approaches the S. lettia 
section. The entire aspect of the bird is much darker than S. giu, 
and especially on the ear-coverts, which are dusky as in S. siictonotus, 
and not silvery grey as in S. gin. White spots on the wing-
coverts are nearly absent. The under surface is much more dusky 
than in the European bird ; and the toes are not only bare at 
the joint, but the lower portion of the tarsus is also naked, as will 
be seen by the following cut:—

Adult Above dark brown, freckled with very minute vermiculations 
of sandy buff, rather coarser on the scapulars; nearly all the 
plumes of the npper surface variegated with distinct spots or bars of 
white, in many cases concealed, but very broad and distinct on the 
hind part of the neck, where they form a tolerably pronounced 
collar; outer scapulars largely marked with sandy buff and white, 
forming a conspicuous shoulder-patch, the white predominating on 
the lower scapulars, which are broadly tipped with blackish on the 
outer web ; head rather darker than the back, and slightly washed 
with greyish, most of the plumes blackish in the centre, and spotted 
on both webs with sandy buff or whitish; ear-tufts orange-buff, 
vermiculated with brown towards the tips, and carrying generally a 
subterminal white spot; wing-coverts rather darker than the back, 
but rather more rufescent, the mottlings very distinctly rufous sandy 
colour, the uppermost of the median series externally marked with 
white spots, the spurious quills also notched with white on the outer

tipped with a line of black ; chin white ; sides of neck greyish, with 
very minute blackish vermiculations, and distinctly spotted or barred 
here and there with white; chest white, the feathers washed with 
orange-buff and crossed with several zigzag lines of dark brown, these 
increasing in number towards the tips of the plumes; all the cross 
lines disappearing on the rest of the underparts, which are nearly 
entirely white, some of them showing a dark shaft-streak, this being, 
however, more apparent on some of the feathers of the chest; under 
tail-coverts pure white, with only the faintest remains of zigzag lines 
at the tips of a few of them; thigh-feathers tawny, gradually 
shading off into white on the tarsus, and distinctly mottled with dark 
brown cross lines ; under wing-coverts yellowish white, the outermost 
dark brown spotted with tawny buff, the lower series ashy

Obs. This is" a very well-marked form of the Scops giu group, and 
is by no means so very different in appearance from S. capensis; but it is 
chiefly remarkable for the ocellated appearance of the head and hind 
neck, the latter having very broad white bars, so as to form a striking 
contrast to the head and back; the ear-coverts are dusky as in 

S. stlctonotus. The character of the under surface is peculiar, and 
has been well commented on by Lord Walden in his original description:—"
The under surface is distinctly divided into two equal 
portions, the first, including the chin, throat, and breast, being wood-
brown, mottled with a little white, light rufous, and black, irregularly 
distributed ; the lower division, including the belly, vent, 
thigh-coverts, and under tail-coverts, is white, speckled with deep 
brown and light rufous.,? 
Considerable differences are exhibited in the three specimens 
possessed by the Museum, but thay all agree in one character, viz. 
the large white spotting on the hind neck, which gives an ocellated 
appearance. Mr. Cuming's specimen is greyish like the one described, 
but is much more obscurely coloured below by reason of the 
numerous greyish vermiculations which crowd the belly; everywhere 
on the upper surface the vermiculations are rather finer. Mr. 
Wallace's bird is much more rufous, but shows the white ocellation 
on the hind neck, and is also a good deal clouded on the belly with 
cross lines.

Of the Scops gki group, and very closely allied to 8. malayantis, 
and resembling it in the dusky grey ear-coverts, but distinguished 
by the absence of the white ocellations on the hind neck and of the 
bars on the centre tail-feathers, and more especially by its rufous 
quills. The following is a description of the type:— 
Adult. General aspect of upper surface more uniform than is usual 
in species of this genus, being of a dusky greyish brown, the feathers 
being blackish in the centre, but scarcely to be called streaked, excepting 
on the fore part of the crown, where the black shafts are 
very broad and distinct, all the feathers of the upper surface so finely 
pencilled with dark brown as to appear almost uniform, with here 
and there a few sandy-coloured mottlings, more distinct on the head, 
to which they impart a slightly spotted appearance; the collar on the 
hind neck very indistinct, some of the feathers being barred with

back, washed with orange-buff, and having the outer web pure white 
tipped with black, forming a conspicuous shoulder-patch; wing-
coverts greyish like the back, the vermiculations very faint and often 
obsolete on the greater series, which have rather large white spots 
on the outer web, the median coverts coarsely vermiculated with 
sandy buff, the feathers with blackish shaft-streaks, the least series 
rufous with obscure blackish cross vermiculations, the outermost of 
the greater series and the primary coverts strongly rufescent, almost 
chestnut in tone, the latter finely vermiculated with blackish• innermost 
secondary quills coloured like the back, and finely vermiculated 
in the same manner, their centres streaked with dusky blackish along 
the shaft, the rest of the quills rufous, barred with dusky brown, 
these bars more or less vermiculated, the inner webs almost entirely 
dusky brown, barred with pale rufous inclining to yellowish on the 
inner web, the rufous bars on the outer web of the primaries inclining 
to white, and producing a somewhat chequered appearance; upper 
tail-coverts exactly like the back, the centre tail-feathers likewise 
strongly resembling the upper surface, inasmuch as they are without 
any distinct trace of cross bars, the outer feathers dark brown, vermiculated 
with sandy rufous, and crossed with seven bars of rufous, 
the subterminal one very indistinct, and lost in the vermiculations at 
the tips, the light bars inclining to white on the outer edge of the 
external web ; loral plumes whitish, the shafts black, and produced 
into long hair-like bristles ; feathers over the eye buffy white, tipped 
with blackish ; sides of face dusky grey, indistinctly varied with fine

of the lower parts the white predominates, many of the feathers only 
having a few zigzag markings of brown, on many of them a strong 
tinge of rufous with broad black central streaks ; some of the flank-
feathers slightly washed with grey; under tail-coverts almost entirely 
whifce, excepting an arrow-shaped mark of rufous or brown near the 
tip ; leg-feathers buffy white, the tarsus slightly streaked with 
brown; under wing-coverts fulvous, those near the edge of the wing 
mottled with brown, the lower series ashy brown with yellowish *

Hume.) 

Ohs, Mr. Hume has been so kind as to lend me the type of this 
bird, which forms an extremely well-marked race of JS. giu; and it 
seem likely that, although future researches and larger series may 
destroy the validity of many of the other races by interposing connecting 
links, a further acquisition of specimens will only lead to 
a more definite recognition of this one. Simply from want of 
material, which may show variation in plumage (though Mr. Hume 

4. SCOPS. 63 
says that he has seen six examples from Ahmednuggur all similar 
in coloration), I keep Scops brucii as a race of 8. giu; but it is impossible 
to overlook the fact that its colouring is quite peculiar, none 
of the other subspecies being any thing like it in the uniformity 
of its general colouring, which I have described as ochraceous grey.

coverts sandy buff, barred with blackish, the hinder ones more 
fulvescent; behind the ear-coverts an indistinct ruff of buffy white 
plumes, narrowly barred" and broadly tipped with deep brown j chin

buffy white; under surface light sandy huff, with a few wavy lines 
and minute vermiculations of blackish, most of the feathers barred 
with white, these white bars margined with a conspicuous irregular 
spot or bar of blackish ; thighs bright chestnut, shading off into buff 
on the tarsi; under wing-coverts yellowish white, with a broad longitudinal 
patch of dark-brown feathers near the edge of the wing, 
which is whitish, the lower series sepia-brown, yellowish white at 
base, thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are 
brown below, barred with fulvous on the inner web; bill yellowish; 
feet fleshy brown ; iris yellow. Total length 9 inches, wing 5*75, 
tail 3-1, tarsus 1*25. 

Obs. The above specimen, which I believe to be one of those 
figured by Mr. Hodgson as S. pennatus (vide suj>ra), is in bad condition 
; but the description agrees in the main with a better-preserved 
Hodgsonian skin, the type of Plwdilus nejwlensis, Gray. 
The Cambridge Museum likewise contains a specimen from Kumaon, 
procured by Captain Boys, which is in better preservation, and 
shows the centre of the abdomen to be very conspicuously white.

Adult male (type of species). Above rufous chocolate, very finely 
vermiculated with black, these markings rather coarser near the 
ends of the feathers, where they sometimes form a subterminal spot; 
the head rather darker than the back, the black centres to the 
feathers broader; round the hind neck a very distinct white collar, 
the feathers being tipped with dusky black, and having a broad subterminal 
band of white; forehead distinctly buffy white, slightly 
spotted with brown, extending backwards so as to form an eyebrow 
as far as the inner web of the ear-tufts, the outer aspect of the 
latter being sandy rufous with blackish cross lines ; on the occiput" 
a few light rufous spots, scarcely forming a band; on the nape, 
however, a distinct indication of a band, the feathers being light 
fulvous ; scapulars externally white, tipped with blackish, and forming 
a distinct shoulder-patch; wing-coverts a little darker than the 
back, the blackish centres larger and the vermiculations coarser, the 
greater series having indications of a whitish spot, the bastard wing-
externally notched with buffy white ,* primary coverts rufous-chocolate, 
with irregular cross bars of blackish; quills rufescent, barred 
with dusky blackish, the inner webs entirely blackish brown, but 
the outer webs barred with this colour, each bar more or less inclining 
to rufous on the outer margin, the interspaces on the primaries buffy

white, giving a chequered appearance to the outer aspect of the 
wing; upper tail-coverts rufous, handed across with blackish ; tail-
feathers rufous, with about six bands of blackish, becoming very 
indistinct and breaking up into vermiculations towards the tip of 
the feather; lores very full and buffy white in colour, tinged with 
rufous near the tip, before which is a dusky black bar; ear-coverts 
bright rufous, with a few faint indications of brown cross lines, the 
hindermost tipped with black; sides of neck strongly mottled with 
white ; chin burly white, with a few brown spots; ruff composed of 
whitish feathers, barred with brown, these bars very distinct and 
somewhat tinged with rufous on the gular plumes; rest of under 
surface of body sandy white, speckled with fine brown vermiculations, 
some of the feathers with longitudinal streaks of dark brown 
down the centre; the sides of the chest rufous, with distinct vermiculations 
; leg-feathers sandy white, mottled with spots and bars of 
dark brown; under tail-coverts white, barred across with rufous 
brown; under wing-coverts brown, washed with rufous, the edge 
of the wing white, the innermost coverts yellowish buff, the lower 
series uniform ashy brown; bill greyish brown, lower mandible 
ochreous ; feet bluish grey, tinged with brown; claws light brown at 
base; iris fine clear yellow. Total length 7*5 inches, wing 5*7, 

tail 3*5, tarsus 1-2. (Mus, Norvic.)

Obs. The authorities of the Norwich Museum having kindly lent 
me the type of this species, I have been enabled to describe it and 
compare it with 8. spilocepJialus, which it so closely resembles as to 
be almost inseparable. The type is in rufous plumage ; and on comparing 
it with an Indian bird in rufous phase, lent me by Mr. Hume, 
the only differences that I can find are the slightly whiter face, eyebrow, 
and collar of the Pormosan bird and the less spotted character 
of the head. The leg-feathers are also not so tawny; but I find 
approaches to all the characteristics of 8. hambroeeki in other Himalayan 
specimens, and therefore the comparison of a series may 
cause it to be united to 8. spilocejohalus. At present the type is 
unique.

Adult (type of species). Above dull sandy brown, everywhere 
minutely and almost imperceptibly vermiculated with wavy blackish 
hair-lines; the hind neck with an indistinct collar of orange-buff 
feathers, mottled at the tips with the same colouring as the back, 
and marked with blackish in various manners, sometimes as a subterminal 
bar, sometimes as a tolerably broad mesial streak, many of 
the feathers white in the centre; feathers of the crown varied with 
blackish mesial streaks, the cross vermiculations being also rather

coarser than on the back, all with concealed tawny buff bases, but 
very few with any indications of a subterminal buff bar, so that the 
general appearance of the head is very uniform; ear-tufts 1 inch 
long, of the same colour as the head, but appearing rather lighter 
by reason of the orange-buff bases showing more plainly and extending 
for two thirds of the inner web; upper scapulars rather 
more blackish, the lower ones inclining to rufous sandy colour, the 
vermiculations less distinct and wider apart, the outermost for the 
greater part white, tipped with a bar of black, forming a very conspicuous 
shoulder-patch; wing-coverts darker brown than the back, 
the greater and median coverts paler and rather more rufescent, the 
vermiculations, as on the lower scapulars, being less distinct; the 
coverts near the edge of the wing notched with white, the median 
series with large ovate white spots on the outer webs, the greater 
coverts less distinctly spotted with white near the tips; quills dark 
brown on the inner webs, sandy brown on the outer, with tolerably 
distinct bars of blackish brown, more or less dissolving into vermiculations, 
the lighter interspaces becoming notches of white on the 
outer web of the primaries, and giving a chequered appearance to 
the external aspect of the wing; the innermost secondaries light 
sandy buff, coarsely vermiculated with blackish wavy lines ; upper 
tail-coverts rufous sandy colour, with wavy linear vermiculations 
as on the back; tail dark brown, barred with sandy buff, the interspaces 
more or less mottled with the latter colour towards the tips 
of the feathers, these, like the extremities of the primaries, being 
thickly mottled with sandy buff; about seven light bars distinguishable 
on the tail, those on the outer rectrices inclining to whitish 
towards the margins of both webs; loral plumes whitish at base, 
the shafts developing into long hair-like bristles; over the front of 
the eye a patch of white feathers, each tipped with a terminal bar 
of blackish, the feathers above the eye with half-concealed white 
bases, forming an inconspicuous superciliary mark; ear-coverts 
greyish white, the feathers round the eye deep sandy brown, with 
narrow little shaft-streaks of fulvous; behind the ear-coverts an 
indistinct ruff, composed of orange-buff feathers, terminally barred 
with black, the plumes of the cheeks white, with orange-buff 
centres and a narrow blackish subterminal line; chin whitish; 
across the throat a continuation of the facial ruff equally indistinct, 
ihe feathers being sandy-coloured at tip, with whitish bases and 
wavy cross lines of black; chest sandy buff, the centres of the feathers 
longitudinally blackish, all the plumes with distinct blackish 
lateral lines (excepting at the tips, which are minutely vermiculated) 
and more or less barred with white, this colour gradually 
extending on the breast and flanks, which are almost entirely white, 
with blackish or sandy rufous centres to the feathers, all of which 
are more or less mottled with sandy and minutely vermiculated 
with wavy lines near the tips ; the under tail-coverts like the belly, 
but having even less distinct cross vermiculations; thighs and 
feathered part of tarsus deep sandy buff, with blackish cross lines; 
under wing-coverts for the most part whitish, with a few blackish

cross lines, those near the outer edge of the wing blackish, slightly 
mottled with fulvous, the lower series ashy brown, fulvous at base, 
like the inner lining of the quills, which is ashy brown, notched on 
the outer and barred on the inner web with fulvous; bill horncolour, 
yellowish at base of lower mandible; feet apparently yellow 
in life. Total length 6-7 inches, wing 5*1, tail 2*5; tarsus 0-85, the 
hinder aspect entirely bare, feathered only for 0*45 in front, the 
bare part being 0*4 inch in length.

Obs. I have given a very careful description and a figure of this 
obscure species, as hitherto it has not been correctly identified by 
Indian naturalists. Indeed its Indian habitat is by no means certain, 
as some of Mr. Beeves's birds came from Malacca and China, 
and it is just possible that it may have had a wrong locality affixed. 
"Were it not for the exact correspondence of the feathering on both 
tarsi, the species looks like Scops malayanus with its tarsal feathers 
rubbed ofT. The following cut exhibits the characters of the leg, 
and will distinguish the species in future*

Adult. Above clear cinnamon rufous, nearly uniform, most of the 
feathers with a narrow central shaft-line of black, a little broader 
on the crown; scapulars externally yellowish buff or pure white, 
with a black subterminal bar; wing-coverts rufous like the back, 
with the same dusky black shaft-lines, broader on the greater series, 
which are white at the tips of their external webs; the spurious 
quills externally whitish, broadly barred with dark brown; primary 

coverts cinnamon, with a spot of yellowish white near the tip of the 

outer web, the inner webs blackish brown; quills dull cinnamon 

rufous, not so bright as the back, with faint cross bars of brown, 

almost obsolete on the innermost secondaries, less distinct on the 

outer ones, but plainer on the primaries, many of the light inter


spaces on the outer webs of the latter inclining to whitish; tail 

cinnamon, the centre feathers nearly uniform, with only faint indi


cations of narrow blackish cross lines, these broader and more distinct 

on the outer feathers, the exterior ones having slight indications of 

whitish spots on the light interspaces; lores white, the elongated 

bristly shafts blackish at tip; over the eye a patch of white feathers, 

narrowly margined with black at their tips; sides of face cinnamon, 

with silvery white shaft-lines to the feathers; behind the ear-

coverts an indistinct ruff of deep cinnamon feathers, broadly termi


nated with black; plumes on the chin whitish; chest cinnamon, 

some of the feathers buffy white at the tips, with broad mesial 

streaks of black; rest of under surface of body for the most part 

white, broadly streaked down the centre with black, many of the 

feathers barred with cinnamon, these light bars conterminously 

freckled with zigzag lines of blackish, the flank-feathers more in


clining to cinnamon, especially on the inner webs; under tail-

coverts nearly entirely white, washed with pale cinnamon near the 

base, and at the tips with a few indications of a central streak of 

dark brown; leg-feathers whitish on the outer face of the tarsus, 

the thighs and upper part of the latter cinnamon; under wing-

coverts yellowish, those near the margin of the wing rufous, mottled 

with brown, the edge of the wing white; lower series of coverts 

ashy brown, yellowish at base; inner lining of quills light cin


namon, indistinctly barred with ashy brown, plainly near the base, 

but disappearing towards the tips of the quills; bill dusky horn


colour; feet fleshy brown; iris bright yellow. Total length 6*7 

inches, wing 5*3, tail 2*5, tarsus 0-9. 

Obs. The description is from one of Hodgson's skins; but 

some specimens show considerable differences, principally on the 

breast and abdomen, both the Penang and Madras specimens having 

the central black streaks very indistinct on the underparts, while 

they vary inter se in the mottling of the abdomen; the leg-feathers 

also are white, distinctly striated with blackish, whereas the Isfepal 

bird scarcely shows any streaks on the tarsus. The Penang spe


cimen shows slight indications of blackish frecklings on the upper 

parts; but this appearance is figured by Hodgson, who appears to 

have regarded this specimen as a more adult bird. The greatest 

difference of all is observable in the tail of the Penang Scops, this 

4. score. 09 
being dark brown, transversely banded with cinnamon, the dark 
bars breaking up into freeklings towards the tips of the feathers. 
This would appear almost to suggest that the specimen was the 
rufous phase of S. mahyensi's; but this I think unlikely, as 1 have 
before me what appears to be the rufous phase of that species. The 
general uniform appearance peculiar to S. sunia is not absent in the 
Penang example; and it appears to me to be a good species, especially 
considering the fact of rufous young having been found in the 
nest by Capt. Hutton {cf. Hume, I.e.),

Nevertheless I shall divide them into subspecies with distinctive 
titles, as follows; but the plates will give a still better idea of the

Adult female. General colour above dark sandy buff, everywhere 
on the upper surface barred with blackish, these dark cross markings 
being little, if any, narrower than the intervening light spaces; so 
that this species has a very strongly barred appearance, all the 
feathers being at the same time broadly streaked with black down 
the centre; hind neck rather lighter than the back, the interspaces 
rather paler and broader; scapulars externally yellowish buff, 
marked with blackish only towards or at the tip; wing-coverts 
decidedly darker than the back, the least ones spotted with sandy 
buff, the median and greater series barred with this colour, many 
of the cross bars paler and inclining to yellowish externally, some 
of the inner greater coverts also barred with yellowish near the tips 
of the feathers; primary coverts sandy buff, with dark brown bases, 
all of them also mottled with dark brown vermiculations in the form 
of irregular bars; quills dull brown on the inner webs, which, however, 
are indistinctly crossed with paler bands of sandy buff, especially 
near the tips, the light bands represented on the outer webs 
by sandy buff bars more ox less inclining to white externally, and 
producing a distinctly chequered appearance, the brown interspaces 
very indistinct, and broken up by reason of extensive vermiculations 
of sandy buff; the secondaries very distinctly barred across with dark 
brown and sandy buff, exactly in the same manner as the primaries, 
but without the whitish spots on the outer web; tail-feathers very 
distinctly barred for their whole extent, the bars strongly characterized 
on the outer feathers, the dark brown and sandy buff cross 
markings being almost equal in width, the brown bars all more 
or less broken up with minute sandy mottlings, the centre feathers 
strongly barred with dark brown near the base, the bars somewhat 
dissolved towards the tips of the feathers; loral plumes whitish at 
base, dark brown at tip, the shafts blackish and elongated into hairlike 
bristles; feathers over the fore part of the eye whitish, narrowly 
tipped with dark brown; ear-coverts sandy buff, faintly 
barred with brown, the shafts distinctly whitish, and giving a narrowly 
streaked appearance; cheeks sandy buff, the feathers tipped 
broadly with black, and very stiff in character, extending backwards 
behind the ear-coverts and forming an indistinct ruff; chin buffy

white, some of the lateral feathers with narrow linear cross markings 
of brown, the plumes of the lower throat sandy buif, with 
central markings and narrow lateral bars of black, the rest of the 
tinder surface entirely sandy buff, the chest-feathers very broadly 
centred with black, the abdominal plumes rather more narrowly; 
all the feathers crossed with narrow blackish lines, the interspaces 
becoming gradually paler on the lower breast and flanks, which 
have thus the appearance of being regularly barred with light buif; 
under tail-coverts yellowish buff, with blackish shaft-streaks and a 
few lateral bars towards the tips; under wing-coverts sandy buff, 
the outermost strongly mottled with brown, the lowest series ashy 
brown, fulvous at base, and thus resembling the inner lining of the 
quills, which are ashy brown below, more or less distinctly barred 
with sandy buff for the whole extent of the inner webs ,* bill dusky; 
feet pale; iris yellow. Total length 9 inches, wing 6*65, tail 3*5, 
tarsus 1*3. 

Adult male. Different from the female in not being so universally 
barred, the upper surface being more vermiculated, while the under 
surface of the body has lost many traces of the blackish cross lines, 
and the lighter fulvous bars are not nearly so well characterized, 
though many of the bars on the lower breast, abdomen, and flanks 
are pure white. Total length 9 inches, wing 7, tail 3*7, tarsus 1-3.

Obs. I follow Mr. Wallace in keeping the Ceram specimens as 
typical S. magicus, as they are doubtless the same as Amboyna 
birds. The characteristic feature of this Scops-Owl is its yellow 
plumage, which pervades the entire aspect of the bird both above 
and below. The ruff and ear-coverts are ochraceous buff; and there 
is no sign of white on the scapulars, which are externally yellowish. 
There is no perceptible collar round the hind neck; and the entire 
upper surface is very strongly banded with fulvous.

Adult female (type of species). General colour above rather rufous 
brown, the feathers blackish in the centre, with distinct lateral lines 
of the same, the interspaces being rather lighter and more fulvous, 
so that a generally barred appearance is produced on the upper surface 
; besides these bars all the feathers are obscurely vermiculated 
with dusky brown, the central black markings to the feathers of the 
crown rather broader, many of them with nothing but a few lateral 
bars or spots of sandy buff, the latter rather larger on the sides of 
the crown; scapulars coloured like the back, the external ones white 
on the outer web, with a broad black bar at the tip; wing-coverts 
rather darker and more blackish than the back, the bases and centres 
to the feathers being blackish, spotted sparingly or barred with sandy 
buff, the greater series appearing more uniform than the other coverts 
by reason of the extreme minuteness of the vermiculations, the 
centres of these feathers streaked with black, some of the outermost 
largely spotted or half-barred with white; primary coverts dusky 
brown, with two indistinctly mottled bars of sandy buff; quills dull 
brown, barred on the inner web with sandy buff, the corresponding 
bars very distinct on the outer webs, especially near the base, the 
tips of all being rather obscured and the bars merged in the sandy 
vermiculations, the primaries externally notched with white, giving 
a distinctly chequered appearance to the outer aspect of the wing; 
upper tail-coverts rather more rufous than the back, the cross-
barring less distinct; tail dull brown, crossed with about ten bands 
of sandy buff, these bands very distinct near the base of the feathers, 
but merging towards the tips, wbich are entirely sandy brown, 
vermiculated with blackish spots and lines, the outermost rectrix 
externally notched with white; lores white, becoming dusky brown, 
the shaft-lines produced into blackish bristles ; feathers in front of 
and just over the fore part of the eye pure white, narrowly tipped 

with black, forming a distinct eye-patch, though scarcely an eyebrow 
; feathers round the eye reddish brown, the ear-coverts dull 
white, obscurely barred with blackish; behind the latter a ruff of 
white feathers, broadly barred with black at the tip, and narrowly 
barred with brown near the base, the throat-feathers more thickly 
lined but not so broadly tipped; chin white; chest sandy rufous, 
broadly streaked with black down the centre of the feathers, many 
of which are also barred and freckled with white, the white increasing 
on the breast and abdomen, the brown vermiculations decreasing in 
proportion, so that these parts are much lighter than the chest; 
under tail-coverts white, barred with sandy buff and streaked down 
the shaft with black; leg-feathers fulvous, rufescent on the tibia, 
all of them distinctly streaked with black ; under wing-coverts yel

lowish white, those near the edge of the wing dark brown, mottled 
with sandy rufous, the under wing-coverts ashy brown, fulvous at

coarsely vermiculated with blackish cross lines and broadly centred 
with black, especially on the head; on the nape a few feathers 
barred with white, but not sufficiently to cause even an indication 
of a band, the hind neck, however, being so broadly and distinctly 
banded with white on many feathers, and washed with ochraceous 
buff near their bases, that a tolerably distinct neck-band is seen; 
on many of the dorsal feathers appear a few sandy buff bars ; the 
scapulars distinctly barred across with sandy buff near the tips of 
the feathers, the outer web pure white, with a tolerably broad black 
tip; wing-coverts coloured like the back and vermiculated in the 
same manner, the median and greater series broadly barred with 
white on the outer web, which is nearly entirely white on the external 
coverts belonging to these series; spurious quills externally 
notched with white; primary coverts dark brown, mottled on the 
outer web with sandy buff vermiculations; quills dark brown, all 
mottled with sandy buff at the tips, the inner web nearly uniform,

with only here and there a faint indication of a lighter sandy-coloured 
bar, these represented on the outer web by a very distinct whitish 
notch, even on the secondaries, the innermost of which are vermiculated 
like the back, with indications of four or five cross bars of 
sandy buff; rump and upper tail-coverts more rufous than the back, 
the vermiculations being very indistinct, except towards the tips of 
the latter, which are also narrowly barred across with white ; tail-
feathers dark brown, mottled with sandy buff vermiculations, and 
having indications of about ten irregular bands of the same colour, 
disappearing gradually towards the tips of the feathers, which are 
entirely vermiculated with sandy colour, and inclining to white on 
the outer web of the external rectrices; loral plumes white, with 
narrow terminal black margins, the shafts also black, and produced 
into hair-like bristles; the frontal plumes also white, tipped and 
centred with black, these light feathers extending backwards towards 
the ear-tufts, which are sandy buff on the inner web, and barred 
with black on the outer; feathers round the eye rufous; ear-coverts 
and sides of face greyish white, with a few indications of obscure 
brown bars, more distinct on the hinder ear-coverts, and merging in 
the line of black-tipped feathers that mark the facial ruff, the plumes 
composing which are buff on the sides of the head, but become whiter 
on the throat, where they are not so broadly tipped or barred with 
black; sides of neck dark brown, but very plainly mottled with bars 
of greyish white; chin-feathers whitish; rest of under surface of 
body for the most part white, washed with sandy buff on the chest, 
most of the feathers with broad black centres, those on the chest 
with lateral zigzag lines of brown, increasing in number and blacker 
in proportion on the abdomen- and flank-feathers, many of which 
have concealed sandy buff bars, excepting those on the side of the 
vent and the under tail-coverts, which are very plainly barred with 
the latter colour, each bar having two conterminous zigzag lines of 
blackish; leg-feathers bright tawny, with narrow bars of blackish, 
the tarsal plumes buffy white, narrowly streaked with black; under 
wing-coverts fulvous, the edge of the wing white, the feathers 
adjoining being dark brown, mottled with sandy buff spots, the lower

Oh$. Scops houruensis is distinguished at once from 8. leucospilus 
by its distinctly mottled forehead, which is largely spotted with 
white, and by its having the sides of the neck also whitish, mottled 
with black. The legs are more thickly feathered than in either 8. 
leucospilus or 8, magicus; the nape and hind neck are also mottled 
with white, forming two indistinct bands. This character goes far 
to indicate the position of the bird as intermediate between the 8.magicus 
group and 8. lettia and allies. On the under surface the 
bird is very white, but the broad black centres give it a distinctive 
appearance.

on the centre of the crown, which are black, with tiny lateral spots 
or notches of sandy rufous ; the bases to the feathers on the sides of 
the crown pale sandy buff, but scarcely forming lateral stripes, the

web nearly uniform dark brown; the scapulars externally sandy 
buff, inclining to white, with a few narrow bars of dark brown, 
some of them barred with white and tipped with black; wing-

paler and more rufous than the back, and mottled with black in the 
centres of the feathers; upper tail-coverts duller than the back and 
barred with blackish and sandy brown; tail dark brown, coarsely 
vermiculated with sandy buff on the edges of the feathers, which 
are likewise crossed with about nine bars of pale sandy colour, inclining

yellowish tipped with black, becoming paler and more fulvescent on 
the throat, more narrowly tipped and scantily barred with black, 
the shaft-streaks being also of the latter colour; sides of neck exactly 
resembling the back, and descending somewhat on to the sides of the

though the lower flanks are barred with white and sandy buff; 
under tail-coverts white, tinged with sand-colour near the tip, which 
has also some remains of blackish shaft-streaks ; leg-feathers ochraceous, 
the tibial plumes barred and the tarsus streaked with dark 
brown• under wing-coverts yellowish white, as also the edge of the 
wing, the feathers adjoining the latter dark brown, mottled with 
sandy rufous, the lower series ashy brown, yellowish white at base,

Obs. This is a very well-characterized Scops Owl. It is strictly 
of the same form and general coloration as S. lemospilus, but is a 
darker-looking bird, and is at once recognizable from that race by 
its buff-coloured ruff and ear-coverts, in these characters resembling 
true S. magicus. It is further like the latter bird in its rufescent 
under surface, on which there are very few white bars.

Ohs. /Scops menadensis is in reality a small form of 8. magicus, to 
which it bears considerable resemblance; but the more slender legs 
and lesser size distinguish it from that and the allied subspecies. 

Notwithstanding the oft-repeated assertion of the identity of Scops 
menadensis of Celebes and 8. rutilus of Madagascar, I think that the 
two can well be distinguished; for, in addition to minor and less 
important characters, the aspect of the inner lining of the quills is, 
in my opinion, sufficient to separate them, in the brown phase at all 
events. In the Madagascar birds this is nearly uniform, with only 
a few broad bars of yellowish white near the base of the feathers ; 
but in 8. menadensis the whole wing is narrowly barred with fulvous 
for its entire extent, and on the outer web of the first primary 
the spots are eight or nine in number; in 8. rutilus they are not 
more than six. The upper surface of 8, menadensis is more stellated, 
the spots being more yellowish in appearance.

Obs. On comparing this Scops Owl with the true S. menadensis, 
to which it has been joined by Mr. "Wallace (Ibis, 1868, p. 25 ; cf. 
Lord Walden, Tr. Z. S. viii. p. 40), it is certain that it is closely allied, 
but differs in several particulars. It has a distinct wash of grey on 
the upper surface, and has the cheeks greyish white; but the principal 
difference lies in the white belly, where it is the prevailing 
colour, the cross markings and lines being very scanty.

Rufous phase. General colour above bright foxy rufous, veiy 
scantily varied with black markings, which are generally confined 
to indistinct shaft-stripes and small lateral cross markings, rather 
broader and more distinct on the crown of the head; the scapulars 
externally white towards the tip of the feather, contrasting 
markedly with the back, but not forming a continuous linear 
streak; upper wing-coverts duller rufous than the back, and more 
coarsely vermiculated with blackish cross markings, especially at 
the base of the median series, which, however, are almost uniform 
foxy rufous at the tips, the greater series nearly uniform externally, 
but barred with lighter buff, and mottled with blackish on the inner 
web; primary coverts blackish, only slightly varied with rufous externally 
and at the tips; quills for the most part dusky brown, 
especially on the inner webs, which are almost uniform, with but 
faint indications of lighter or more rufescent bars, the tips more 
distinctly rufescent, the corresponding light spots or bars on the 
primaries rufous, some of them whitish; secondaries dusky brown 
on the inner web, the light bars very indistinct, even on the outer 
webs, which are vermiculated with indistinct lines and spots of 
brown, the innermost secondaries almost entirely dull foxy rufous, 
with more or less distinct transvermiculations of blackish, forming 
here and there indications of bars; upper tail-coverts resembling the 
back, but a little more dingy; tail dull foxy rufous, barred with dull 
blackish, of which bars nine or ten can be distinguished on the outer 

feathers, where they are broader than the rufescent interspaces, the 
centre feathers more mottled with blackish, neither the dark nor the 
light bars distinctly indicated; lores white, with elongated black 
hair-like shafts; an indistinct eyebrow whitish, the feathers margined 
with foxy red, and tipped with dark brown; ear-tufts exactly 
resembling the crown; sides of face bright foxy red, with a few indistinct 
streaks of silvery white on the ear-coverts, behind which 
runs a slightly developed ruff of buff plumes, narrowly tipped with 
black; chin whitish ; rest of under surface of body bright foxy red, 
like the back, many of the feathers mesially streaked with blackish, 
these streaks narrower on the flanks, many of the lateral and abdominal 
feathers being mottled and tipped with white; the feathers on 
each side of the vent white, barred with foxy rufous; on the fore

neck an appearance of a white paten, centre of abdomen also whitish, 
the under tail-coverts slightly tipped with pale foxy red; leg-
feathers whitish on the thighs, inclining to buff on the tarsal plumes; 
edge of wing and inner under wing-coverts whitish, those near the 
outer edge of the wing dark brown, narrowly barred with rufous, 
the lower series brown, bufry white at base. Total length 8*5 inches, 
wing 6*1, tail 3*3, tarsus 1*15. 

Br own phase. Above very dark brown, almost blackish, varied 
with rufous buff markings, forming one or two rows of spots or bars 
of this colour near the tips of the feathers, which are also vermiculated 
with rufous buff, especially on the dorsal plumes and scapulars, 
the outer web of the latter having large white spots extending 
on to the inner web in some of them; head coloured like the 
back, but rather more minutely spotted with rufous buff, excepting 
on the auricular tufts, where the markings are larger, especially on 
the inner webs; wing-coverts blackish, the least series minutely 
spotted with rufous buff, the greater series more vermiculated with 
the latter colour, especially on the inner web, the outermost of this 
series being irregularly but conspicuously marbled with white, the 
greater series also white near the tip of the outer web, but all of 
these coverts more largely barred and mottled with rufous buff than 
the rest of the wing-coverts; primary coverts blackish, slightly 
barred on the outer web with rufous buff; quills blackish, nearly 
uniform on the inner webs of the primaries, externally notched with 
white near the base, these inclining to rufous towards the tips, 
which have indistinct remains of rufeseent barring on the inner web 
also; the secondaries very faintly barred with rufous on the inner 
web, but more plainly on the outer one; the innermost secondaries 
blackish, very distinctly mottled with rufous buff vermiculations, 
and resembling the back; tail-feathers blackish, tipped with rufous 
and crossed with about Hive other narrow bars of rufous buff, the 
interspaces slightly freckled with dull rufeseent colour near the tips 
of the feathers; lores dull whitish, washed with brown, the shafts 
black and elongated so as to form hair-like bristles; plumes at the 
base of the forehead and over the fore part of the eye white, with 
narrow rufous brown tips; ear-coverts dull rufous brown, transversely 
barred with blackish, the lower part varied with a slight 
indication of silvery white bars; behind the ear-coverts a faintly 
indicated ruff of rufous buff plumes narrowly barred with black; 
chin and fore part of cheeks whitish; remainder of under surface 
rufous buff, the feathers broadly streaked down the centre with 
black, these markings wider on the chest, which has consequently a 
more dingy appearance; most of the feathers obscured with minute 
narrow vermiculations traversing the feathers, many of which incline 
to white on their outer margin; this white colour amounts 
only to a few lateral spots on the chest-feathers, gradually widening 
and taking the form of bars on the flanks and sides of the body, the 
feathers on the sides of the vent and under tail-coverts being white 
barred with rufous ; leg-feathers buff, crossed with numerous small

BUBONTDiE, 

brown bars; inner under wing-coverts yellowish white, the edge of 

the wing also whitish, the coverts near the edge dark brown mottled 

with fulvous spots, the lowest series blackish, the bases yellowish 

white, resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are for the 

most part blackish, with a few broad bars of yellowish white near 

the base of the inner web, the tips of the quills with a few slightly 

indicated pale rufous bars. Total length 8 inches, wing 5*9, tail 2*9, 

tarsus 1*15. 

Obs. The differences exhibited by the series of specimens in the 

Museum are not very considerable, although few are quite so dark 

as the one described. Two of these rather lighter examples have 

the auricular tufts barred across with rufous buff, but differ more 

conspicuously in the greater amount of variegation on the under 

parts, which are very prettily mottled with the white bars; these 

are fully developed as narrow bars on the breast-feathers; and the 

flanks and abdominal plumes have, in many instances, bars right 

across the feathers, both near the tip and near the base.

indicated, and the whole of the inner quills more vermiculated, so 
as to resemble the back in a greater degree; tail dark brown, crossed 
with nine bars of sandy buff on the middle feathers, and with ten or 
eleven on the outer ones; these bars less distinct towards the end 
of the tail-feathers, which, like the tips of the wings, are coarsely

am unable to place it in its true position in the synopsis.

Obs. Mr. Hume has kindly sent me two specimens of this Scops 
Owl recently described by him. It holds much the same relation 
to 8. semitorques of Japan that 8. lettia of the Himalayas does to 

8. elegans of China, being smaller and, in its brown phase, darker, 
while it further differs in possessing a grey phase, resembling the 
grey phase of 8. medabarieus, which was called by Jerdon 8. yriscus.

Adult (grey phase). General colour greyish, brown, more or less 
inclining to an ochraeeons shade, all the upper surface thickly mottled 
with wavy cross lines of black, the feathers at the same time varied 
with ochraceous, forming concealed irregular bars of this colour; 
forehead and sides of crown greyish white, the feathers crossed with 
narrow wavy lines of brown, extending right to the ear-tufts, which 
are greyish white or buff on the inner web, the outer webs brown, 
slightly freckled with sandy buff; crown rather more rufous or sandy 
brown, the feathers closely vermiculated with blackish lines, and 
much varied with ochraceous buff spots; round the nape an indistinct 
collar of ochraceous feathers, all with more or less characterized cross 
vermiculations of dark brown; below this first collar the hind neck 
is again dark brown, exactly like the head, and this is succeeded by 
another ochraceous buff collar round the hind neck, the freeklings 
of brown on these feathers being somewhat coarser, and the blackish 
tips rather broader; scapulars externally ochraceous buff, some of 
them almost entirely of this colour on both webs, the vermiculations 
disappearing towards the outer webs; wing-coverts dark brown, 
freckled with blackish vermiculations exactly like the back, the 
central streaks to the feathers darker, both the median and greater 
series whitish at the tips, the freeklings gradually disappearing; 
primary coverts sandy brown, freckled with dark brown, the latter 
colour forming also three or four distinct bars across them; quills 
brown, barred with lighter brown, these light bars paler externally 
and mottled with dark brown vermiculations, the primaries externally 
whitish on the interspaces, causing a chequered appearance on 
the outer aspect of the wing, the inner secondaries greyish like the 
back and mottled with blackish vermiculations precisely in the same 
manner; tail ochraceous brown, regularly barred with darker brown, 
the dark bars being about ten on the outer feathers, less distinct at 
their tips, the light interspaces freckled with dark brown vermiculations 
; lores whitish, the long shaft-stripes blackish at tip ; over 
the eye a patch of whitish feathers, narrowly margined at the tip 
with blackish ; sides of face greyish white, indistinctly waved with 
narrow cross lines of brown, the hinder ear-coverts broadly tipped 
with black; behind the ear-coverts an indistinct ruff of pale ochraceous 
buff feathers, rather broadly tipped with blackish, a little 

narrower under the throat; chin whitish; rest of under surface 
greyish white, the blackish shaft-lines not very strongly pronounced, 
all the feathers narrowly waved with cross lines of brown, disappearing 
on the centre of the abdomen and under tail-coverts, which 
are pure white; leg-feathers silky white, with a few indications of 
narrow brown cross markings ; under wing-coverts yellowish white, 
mottled with cross lines of dark brown near the edge of the wing,

winch is white, the lowest series ashy brown, yellowish white at the 

bases, and resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are ashy 

brown below, barred with slightly paler brown, inclining to yellowish 

white near the bases of the feathers; " bill bluish horn (more or less 

yellow in dried skins) ; feet fleshy grey; iris variable, yellow in the 

young, brown in the old birds " {Hodgson). Total length 8*5 inches, 

wing 6*3, tail 3*3, tarsus 0*35. 

" Sexes alike " (Hodgson). 

Obs. The brown phase of this plumage is very similar to the one 
above described in character and markings, but is brown on the 
upper surface where the other bird is greyish. The under surface, 
however, is not very different. Mr. Hodgson has given four figures 
of the species in his 'Drawings;7 and in one of them he considers 
the grey and brown phases to be summer and winter plumage. 
Although amongst his four skins in the Museum we doubtless possess 
the t3rpes of his species, I could not make the specimens so 
thoroughly agree with any of the paintings as to satisfy myself that 
I could identify the actual individuals figured,

described by Mr. Cassin bore a label " En mer, cotes du Japon, lat. 29° 47' N., 
long. 126° IB' 20" B." It is impossible to speak with certainty of this species 
without examining the type; but I quote the following remarks of Mr. Cassin 
which accompany the original description, and which apply very well to Mr. 
Swinhoe's S. glabripes. " This is one of the handsomest of the small species of 
Owls, and bears some resemblance (rather remote, however, and on a small scale) 
to the large Horned Owls. It is somewhat like S. semitorques (Temm.), but 
wants the white on the throat and breast, and is smaller and differently coloured, 
and has the toes bare. It resembles also to some extent S. lettia (Bodgs.) and 
8. lempiji (Horsf.), but is larger than either, and is otherwise different. The 
brown stripes and lines on all parts of the plumage are unusually delicate." 
The dimensions are given as follows:—" Total length of skin from tip of bill to 
end of tail about 8J to 9 inches, wing 6f, tail 3-|."

dark brown, and all broadly tipped with white, giving a hoary 
appearance to the upper parts; under surface of body white, tinged 
with ochraceous buff here and there, and obscurely barred across 
with dark brown: even in the nestling the tarsal feathering very 
dense. 

Adult female. Above dull sandy brown, everywhere freckled with 
blackish vermiculations, much broader and more distinct in the 
centres of the feathers, giving in some indications of mesial streaks ; 
head and neck rather more rufescent than the back, the feathers 
coarsely mottled or dotted with small spots of sandy rafous, the 
centres of the feathers of the crown blackish, with broad lateral 
cross lines of black; on the head and hind neck are three bands— 
one on the occiput not very distinct, composed of greyish white 
feathers scantily freckled with black cross lines, the shaft-streaks 
being black; on the nape a second and more distinct band of greyish 
white feathers coarsely mottled with sandy rafous at the tips and 
vormiculated with black, minute frecklings of the latter colour being 
apparent on most of the white feathers; round the hind neck a third 
and very distinct collar of ochraceous buff plumes less barred and 
mottled with blackish than the two preceding ones, and consequently 
more distinct; scapulars rather greyer than the rest of the back, the 
outermost yellowish buff externally, with scarcely any blackish 
frecklings; wing-coverts rather darker brown than the back, and a 
little more rufous, the blackish vermiculations being very coarse, the 
greater coverts fulvescent towards their tips, forming a uniform spot 
on the outer web, but mottled with blackish vermiculations near the 
tip of the inner one; spurious quills externally notched with fulvous 
; primary coverts blackish brown, crossed with about four bars of 
deep tawny buff, more or less obscured with blackish vermiculations ; 
quills dark brown, barred with paler brown, these being represented 
on the outer web by not strictly conterminous bars of sandy buff, 
everywhere slightly obscured with blackish vermiculations, the outer 
webs of the primaries largely notched with bufry white, giving a 
chequered appearance to this portion of the wing, the innermost 
secondaries mottled and vermiculated like the scapulars; tail dark 
brown, varied towards the tips with vermiculations of sandy buff 
and crossed with seven bands of the same on the outer feathers, only 
about six being distinguishable on the centre ones; frontal and loral 
plumes ashy white, narrowly margined with blackish, these plumes 
forming at the same time a very conspicuous eyebrow; the adjacent 
sides of the crown are at the same time ashy white, extremely finely 
vermiculated with brown, so as to form a streak along the sides of 
the head, continued even to the ear-tufts, which are 1*25 inch long, 
and are greyish white on the other side, with fine brownish cross 

lines, the outer webs blackish at tip and mottled with rufous spots; 
above the hinder part of the eye a small patch of rufous feathers 
mottled with black, produced backwards to the base of the ear-
tufts, the outermost small plumes of which resemble them in colour; 
sides of face ashy white, slightly tinged with rufous below the eye,

and banded across with narrow blackish cross lines; behind the car-
coverts a tolerably distinct ruff of whitish feathers washed with 
bandy rufous before the tip, which is black, this ruff continued 
across the throat, where a few of the plumes are somewhat deeper 
rufous, crossed with blackish lines ; chin white, the lower feathers 
washed with fulvous and crossed with numerous fine lines of dark 
brown; across the fore neck a faint indication of a white band; 
centre of the abdomen, vent, and under tail-coverts white, the latter 
with a few narrow rufous cross lines; rest of under surface ashy 
whitish, strongly inclining to sandy colour, especially on the chest 
and sides, all the feathers crossed with narrow brown, occasionally 
rufous, lines, and varied here and there with blackish central streaks; 
tibial plumes yellowish buff, inclining to buffy white on the tarsi, 
narrowly barred across with dark brown; under wing-coverts pale 
sandy buff, rather more rufescent near the edge of the wing, which 
is white, the marginal coverts slightly marked with dark brown bars, 
the lower series ashy brown, yellowish white at base, resembling the 
inner lining of the quills, which are ashy brown, barred with yellowish 
white on the inner web* iris black. Total length 11*5 inches,

buff; feathers round the eye clear rufous, extending to the base of the 
ear-tufts ; ear-coverts greyish, shaded with rufous and indistinctly 
barred across with dark brown, the hinder ear-coverts tipped with 
black, and resembling the ruff, which is ochraceous buff tipped with

whitish, crossed with fine linear bars of dark brown ; sides of neck _ 
greyish white, more or less washed with rufous and covered with 
wavy vermiculations of dark brown ; fore neck inclining to white ; 
rest of under surface ashy white, with broad central black markings

with sandy buff, more or less vermiculated with brown, the bars 
seven on the centre feathers, including the terminal one • " bill pale 
flesh-grey, with a pale yellowish rim to the mandibles ; iris golden 
burnt sienna, but so narrow that this colour is seldom visible, the im


mense pupil filling up all the space between the Hds; skin round eye 
madder-brown ; toes naked, light flesh-colour; claws light brownish 
grey, with blackish tips " (Swinhoe). Total length 8*5 inches, wing 
0*9, tail 3*6, tarsus 1*5. (Mus. B. Swinhoe.) 

Obs. But for Mr. Swinhoe's remark as to the difference in the 
colour of the eye, I should have been content to unite this bird to 

8. elegans. The yellow tibia is by no means a character of the 
species, as it exists in all the little Owls of this group ; and S. trythrocampa 
further resembles 8. elegans in the extent of feathering on 
the foot, as well as in the complete barring of the tail. It depends 
for its separation, therefore, on its rufous face and differently coloured 
eye ; but it is by no means a very distinct bird.

Obs. The present species in its typical form has but two phases, 
a brown and a rufous one, the latter being the usual colouring, the 
former very rare in comparison with it. It never shows a grey 
phase like S. lettia, and is always distinguished by its completely 
unfeathored toes. 

4. SCOPS. 93 
The amount of feathering on the lower joint of the tarsus varies 
slightly with individuals ; but specimens of S. lenipiji never seem to 
have the plumes descending so far down on the outer toe as in B. 
lettia; and in this respect it very closely approaches 8. malabaricm. 
Indeed^ as stated below, they are but races one of the other. Mr. 
Hume has sent over for my inspection two very interesting specimens, 
one from Thayetmyo and another from Calcutta, which 
form an intermediate race between the Malaccan and South-Indian 
biids. They differ in their very pale coloration and fulvcscent tone 
of plumage, and in the excessively delicate character of the vermiculations. 
A good idea of these differences will be seen on an examination 
of the plates in Mr. Hume's forthcoming work on the 
birds of the Indian empire. 

It may be noted that although closely resembling Scops malabaricus, 
the present species nevertheless presents some differential 
characters, especially in the absence of mesial black streaks, either 
on the upper or under surface, the black markings being more in 
the form of spots and bars.

Adult male (type of species). Above dull sandy brown, the 
feathers mesially black, and mottled with coarse blackish vermiculations, 
relieved here and there with a broader bar of sandy buff; 
head rather blacker than the back, varied only with a few lateral 
spots and notches of rufous sandy; forehead biiffy white, the feathers 
narrowly margined with black at the tips, extending backwards so 
as to form a very distinct eyebrow; the sides of the crown fulvescent, 
with narrow cross lines and vermiculations of blackish, 
forming an indistinct band on the sides of the head, continuous with 
the ear-tufts, the inner webs of which are ochraceous, narrowly 
barred with black; on the occiput and nape a few fulvous feathers 
scarcely forming bands; on the hind neck a very distinct collar of 
ochraceous buff, some of the feathers varied with dark brown cross 
bars, and resembling the sides of the neck, which are ochraceous, 
mottled with brown; the scapulars externally clear ochraceous, 
tipped with dark brown, the inner web also mottled with ochraceous 
; upper wing-coverts dark brown, more obscure than the back, 
and vermiculated with rufous sandy, the greater series mottled with 
ochraceous on the outer webs; primary coverts dark brown, obscurely 
vermiculated with rufous sandy colour near the tips, and 
indistinctly barred across with the same; quills dark chocolate-
brown on the inner webs, with faint indications of pale ashy brown 
bars, the outer web barred with sandy brown, obscured with vermiculations 
of dark brown, disappearing on the primaries, which 
are externally barred with clear sandy colour, none of these, however, 
inclining to whitish; upper tail-coverts coloured like the back,

but a little more dingy; tail-feathers dark brown, profusely mottled 
with sandy buff near the tips, and barred most irregularly with the 
same colour, the bars on the centre feathers not even being conterminous 
; loral plumes whitish at base, washed with rufous near the 
tips, and indistinctly barred across with black; all the feathers 
round the eye and the ear-coverts sandy rufous, obscurely barred 
across with black, paler and more whitish on the lower margin of 
the ear-coverts, where they join the ruff, which is composed of huffy 
white feathers, broadly tipped with black, the plumes on the throat 
having additional narrow cross lines of black; the chin-feathers 
whitish; rest of under surface dull fulvous, very thickly obscured 
with cross vermiculations of dark brown, many of the feathers with 
longitudinal black streaks, narrower and less pronounced on the 
abdomen and ilanks, where the feathers are whiter and less thickly 
mottled; leg-feathers dull tawny, thickly barred with dark brown ; 
under tail-coverts white, with a few vermiculatory markings of 
brown near the tips ; under wing-coverts sandy buff, the outermost 
mottled with brown, the lower series ashy brown, with concealed 
yellowish bases, the inner lining of the quills ashy brown, with faint 
indications of paler bars, and barred with sandy buff near the base 
of the inner web; bill yellowish. Total length 9 inches, wing 6-4, 
tail 3-4, tarsus 1*5. (Mus. B. Swinhoe.) 

Hab. Hainan. 

Obs. The type specimen kindly lent me by Mr. Swinhoe shows 
that this is a form of S. lemjpiji differing from the ordinary examples 
of that species by its less rufous coloration and greater 
amount of vermiculation. At the same time, however, it so closely 
resembles greyish brown birds which I have seen from Java, in 
Lord Walden's collection, and which we have in the Museum from 
the " Sunda Islands," as to seem but a large edition of that species 
; but, until more specimens arrive, it will be difficult clearly to 
settle its position.

Adult (rufous phase). General colour above light sandy, with 
tolerably distinct vermiculations of black, all the dorsal feathers 
mesially streaked with the latter colour, many of these central 
markings being in the form of spear-shaped spots; the scapulars 
externally sandy buff, blackish at the tips of the outer webs, on 

4. SCOPS. 95 
many of which the vermiculations are nearly obsolete; head darker 
than the back, blackish brown in the centre of the crown, all the 
feathers centred or marginally spotted with rufous sandy, the lores 
buffy whitish, tipped with black; feathers over the eye sandy buff, 
with narrow black tips, these plumes forming a tolerably distinct 
band down the sides of the head continuous with the ear-tufts, 
which are sandy buff on the inner web and at the base, the outer 
webs rufous sandy colour, barred with dark brown, many of the 
smaller feathers rufous, with coarse vermiculations of dark brown; 
on the nape and occiput some tolerably distinct bars of sandy buff 
give an indication of a faint band; the hinder neck pale sandy buff, 
tipped with blackish brown, and forming a very distinct collar running 
round to the sides of the neck, which are also sandy buff, 
slightly vermiculated with brown; over the hinder part of the eye 
a small patch of rufous feathers running backwards to the base of 
the ear-coverts; cheeks and ear-coverts rufous sandy, the latter 
slightly inclining to silvery white on their lower margin, the hinder 
ones broadly tipped with black, and merging in an indistinct ruff 
running down the sides of the head, and composed of sandy buff 
plumes, narrowly tipped with black, these tips becoming narrower 
on the gular feathers, which are also crossed with fine wavy lines of 
brown; chin fulvescent; on the fore neck a faintly indicated white 
band; rest of under surface sandy-coloured, with very few traces 
of vermiculations; the chest broadly streaked with black mesial 
stripes, somewhat broken up near the base on some of the feathers 
and dilating towards the tip on others, those on the abdomen and 
flanks much narrower, and disappearing entirely on the under tail-
coverts, which are whitish; leg-feathers buffy whitish; under 
wing-coverts also buffy white, with a few markings of sandy buff 
or brown near the outer edge of the wing, the lower series ashy 
brown, buffy white at base, resembling the inner lining of the quills, 
which are ashy brown below, with scarcely any indications of lighter 
bars, excepting on the inner quills, where they are yellowish white 
towards the base; upper wing-coverts coloured like the back, and 
vermiculated in the same manner, with several distinct indications 
of sandy buff bars, the median and greater series almost uniform 
sandy buff at their tips, with very few vermiculations, and giving 
the appearance of a buff-coloured spot; spurious quills indistinctly 
notched with buffy white on the outer web ; primary coverts dark 
brown, with a few indistinct vermiculated cross bars of sandy buff; 
quills dark brown, barred on the inner web with ashy brown, these 
represented on the outer web by sandy bars, more or less vermiculated 
with dark brown, and inclining to buff on the primaries; 
the innermost secondaries resembling the back and scapulars; tail 
brown, vermiculated, like the quills, with sandy buff towards the 
tips, crossed with about seven bands of clearer sandy colour. Total 
length 8 inches, wing 5*5, tail 3-25, tarsus 1-15. 

The grey phase is so very similar to the corresponding plumage 
of Scops lettia, that a description is unnecessary. It may be mentioned 
as exactly resembling that species, but to be distinguished by

Ohs In this species we have a parallel case with the Sjpizaeti of 
India, where the hill form, 8. nipalensis, differs only slightly in plumage,' 
but depends for its characters on the exaggerated feathering 
of its tarsus for separation from 8. cirrliatus (cf. Sharpe, Cat. B. i. 
p 261). The Malabar Scops Owl resembles in the main the Himalayan 
8. lettia, but differs in the smaller extent of the tarsal feathering, 
which does not coyer the toes. If I am right in considering 
Scops c/riseas to be the same species as 8. malabaricus, of which 
it Is the grey phase, then it is certain that 8a lettia never shows 
such a thoroughly rufous phase as the typical 8. malabaricus. In 
its rufescent form it is nothing but a large 8. lempiji. ^ The Ceylonose 
biid appears to be identical with the South-Indian, though 
in the Museum the majority of the specimens are rufescent. I have 
not, indeed, seen a really grey-plumaged bird from Ceylon, the 

darkest examined being of a very dark brown, blackish on the head 
and greyish underneath, with very coarse vermiculations.

Adult male. General colour above ashy grey, narrowly vermiculated 
across with, dark brown, the dorsal plumes with more or less distinct 
mesial streaks of black; scapulars pure white on the outer web, 
forming a distinct longitudinal patch down the wing; head much 
lighter grey than the back, the feathers in the centre of the crown 
blackish, mottled with white, which is distributed in duplicate spots 
on either web; sides of the crown paler and more whitish, delicately 
pencilled with transverse linear vermiculations; auricular tufts 
1*8 inch long, coloured and pencilled like the crown, black on the 
outer web for nearly the apical half of the plume, the tip also black; 
wing-coverts coloured like the back, but more obscurely mottled, 
the dark mesial streaks being browner and somewhat less pronounced 
than on the back, the median series paler and having the 
ground-colour of the feathers whiter than the other series; edge of 
the wing all round pure white; primary and greater coverts greyish 
white, broadly barred across with dark brown, the light interspaces 
freckled and obscured with brown vermiculations; quills greyish 
brown, barred across with brown, these bars being about nine in 
number on the primaries, which incline to greyish ^hite on their 
outer margin; the secondaries similarly coloured and having 
whitish tips, the interspaces of these quills decidedly grey, freckled 
with brown vermiculations, the innermost secondaries coloured more 
like the back, vermiculated with brown, but the dark cross bars 
nearly obsolete; tail ashy grey, crossed with about nine bars of 
dark brown, irregular in shape, the interspaces freckled with brown 
vermiculations; lores, eyebrow, and entire face pure white, the 
hinder margin of the ear-coverts black, forming a distinct broad bar 
of black down the sides of the head; over the eye a patch of greyish 

brown feathers; sides of neck pale greyish white, with very minute 
transverse frecklings of brown; under surface of body pale ashy 
grey, all the feathers crossed with narrow linear frecklings of brown,

the black shaft-stripes very distinctly indicated; across the throat a 
tolerably broad band of white, separating the throat from the chest; 
centre of breast, abdomen, flanks, leg-feathers, and under tail-coverts 
pure silky white, the black shaft-streaks distinct on the flank-
feathers, which, however, have little or no trace of the transverse 
brown freeklings; under wing-coverts pure white, the outermost of 
the lower series white at base, ashy brown for their terminal half, 
and resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are dull greyish 
white, barred with ashy brown; bill and feet bluish white; iris 
bright orange. Total length 9*5 inches, wing 7*7, tail 3-85, 

tarsus 1-7. 

Young. Above more ochreous grey than the adults, regularly 

transvermiculated with brown; underneath browner and more 

washed with yellowish on the lower parts than the old birds. 

Obs. But very little difference exists in the plumage of this Owl, 

which appears to constitute only one species all over Africa. Two 

specimens in the Museum collection (one from the White Nile, the 

other from the Gambia) have the hinder part of the crown, nearly 

uniform black; and as this is accompanied by a much greater 

breadth of the mesial streaks to the feathers of the upper surface, 

and by a yellowish tint underneath, perhaps the birds may be not 

quite adult. In the Damara specimen described, the legs are nearly 

pure white, with only the faintest remains of tiny brown streaks on 

the lower parts; but in some examples the legs are very distinctly 

streamed.

Adult (type of species). General colour above rufous chocolate, 
with a few fine, nearly obsolete vermiculations of black, the whole 
upper surface with more or less concealed spots of rufous buff, very 
minute on the crown, but much more distinct on the back, where 
they form almost bars, all the e?ght spots having a blackish margin; 
scapular feathers externally barred with white, the interspaces very 
pale, and inclining to ochraceous; wing-coverts coloured like the 
back, the bases dark brown, the tips chocolate rufous, with rather 
more distinct vermiculations of black, the spots very plain, and 
forming notches on the outer web of some of the greater series; 
primary coverts exactly like the other, brown at base, rufescent at 
tips, but without the light spots; quills dark brown, nearly uniform 
on the inner web, and chocolate-rufous at the tips of the primaries 
and on the outer webs of the secondaries, which are minutely notched 
with fulvous, the primaries very distinctly chequered with white on 
the outer webs, the innermost secondaries spotted with rufous buff, 
resembling the scapulars; tail dark brown near the base, crossed 
with about six bars of dull rufous, these becoming obsolete towards 
the tips of the feathers, which are rufous chocolate, very finely vermiculated 
with black, the outer feather externally notched with 
fulvous, and all the feathers of the wings and tail barred with fulvous 
on the inner web, especially towards the base; forehead and 
feathers over the fore part of the eye creamy white, narrowly tipped 
with brown; loral plumes rufous, the shafts ending in black hairlike 
bristles, barred obscurely with black; ear-coverts rufous chocolate, 
barred and tipped with black; cheeks fulvous, all the feathers 
tipped, and some of them barred across, with dull black; general 
colour of under surface rufous sandy, obscured with grey, and finely 
vermiculated with blackish cross lines, the bases of the feathers, 
especially those of the flanks, strongly rufescent, broadly barred with 
fulvous, inclining to white near the tips of most of the feathers; and 
before this whitish tip, appears generally a slight indication of a 
diamond-shaped spot of black, evidently the remains of a streak; 
all the above markings, though distinct on the abdomen and flanks, 
are less plainly characterized on the chest, which is consequently 
more dusky; leg-feathers orange-tawny, narrowly barred with dark 
brown; under wing-coverts fulvous, slightly marked with brown 
and spotted with sandy buff near the edge of the wing, which is 
whitish, the lower series dark brown, fulvescent at base, resembling 
the inner lining of the quills, which are dark brown, notched on the 
outer web and barred on the inner with fulvous. Total length 
7*5 inches, wing 5*45, tail 32 , tarsus 1-15. (Mus. Intl. Oah.) 

Obs. Another specimen, very kindly lent me by Mr. Hume, differs

considerably from the one described. It is not such a deep rufous 
in colour, and is much more thickly spotted both above and below, 
recalling Scops spilocephalus; the under surface is much paler and 
greyer, the white bars very large and distinct, and extending even 
on to the chest. Total length 7*5 inches, wing 5-6, tail 3*2, 
tarsus 1-15. 

Hah. Andaman Islands. 

Obs. It has been suggested by Mr. Hume that the bird from the 
Andamans, named Scops modestus * by Lord Walden, must be the 
young bird of $. balli; and I confess that, until I examined and compared 
the types, I entertained a similar impression. Lord Walden, 
however, having kindly lent me the original specimen of S. modestus 
for examination, I have come to the conclusion that the two species 
are quite distinct. Lord "Walden has two specimens precisely 
similar; and they seem to me to represent the young of some species 
of the S. malayanus type. Immature they certainly are; but they 
present too many differences for me to refer them to S. balli. The 
type of the latter has been lent to me by Mr. Hume; and as the 
wings and tail in S. modesties are doubtless those of the adult bird, 
I draw attention to the following characters, which, as it seems to 
me, must separate the two; for in no other species of Scops is such 
a difference known between the young and the adult stages.

of the ear-coverts, which are tipped with black, and thus assimilate 

to the ruff, which is composed of greyish white feathers tipped with 

black, before which is a subterminal bar of orange, the plumes on 

the throat crossed with several greyish black lines; chin fulvous; 

rest of under surface white, with wavy cross lines of blackish, many 

of the feathers with broad central streaks of black, very distinct on 

the abdomen, where the vermiculations are fewer, being* almost ob


solete on the under tail-coverts, which are white washed with 

orange-buff; the broad central streaks on the breast-feathers in 

many cases edged with rufous; leg-feathers whitish, barred with 

brown on the outer aspect, and streaked with the same on the inner 

face of the tarsus; the tibia yellowish; under wing-coverts yel


lowish, the outer edge of the wing white, the adjacent feathers

lining of the quills, barred with fulvous, especially on the inner 

web. Total length 6-5 inches, wing 5*35, tail 2*7, tarsus 0*85. 

Itufous pTiase. Orange-rufous where the other bird is grey, the 

markings exactly similar, and the three bands visible on the head 

and hind neck, the occipital one being the most difficult to trace; 

under surface very coarsely mottled, the cross bars being broad, and 

the central black streaks very distinct; all the lower parts strongly 

pervaded with orange-buff, forming a distinct patch on the throat. 

Total length &5 inches, wing 5*15, tail 2-8, tarsus 0*85. 

Obs. Both the specimens above noticed are from Mexico. Mr. 
Salvin has kindly lent me two from Guatemala, which, besides being 
larger, differ also in the peculiar way in which the orange and grey 
are intermingled; the stripes on the sides of the head, as well as the 
three characteristic bands, are very highly developed; the eyes are 
surrounded by bright orange-buff, which is also the pervading colour 
on the ear-coverts. Measurements are as follows:—

The present species, which is the representative in America of 
Scops giu, appears to be very variable ; and although grey birds often 
have an admixture of orange in their plumage, sometimes this disappears, 
perhaps with age, as in the British Museum is a perfectly 
grey bird, on which scarcely a tinge of orange colouring remains, 
either above or below, while the whole appearance of the specimen 
is dingy, owing to the closeness and frequency of the vermiculations.

Obs. After a very careful and extended study of the American 
Scops Owls, in which I had the assistance of the beautiful series 
contained in the Salvin-Godman collection, I have arrived at the 
conclusion that three different and fairly recognizable forms have 
been confounded under the collective title of Scops brasiliamia in 

4. SCOPS. Ill 
general use. The Brazilian bird always has a mixture of yellowish 
in the plumage of the under surface, and the two phases of its 
plumage are of a " brown" and " ochraceous " cast; whereas the 
Central-American bird has a decided " rufous" phase, very like 
Seeps aslo, but always to be distinguished by its bare toes: the 
brown phase never exhibits any yellow shade below. A third race, 
recognizable in both its phases, is to be seen in Scops ustus from the 
Upper Amazons. Measurements are of no help; for the dimensions 
of the three birds are much alike, and a summary of the specimens 
examined gives the following results ;—

Adult male (grey phase). General colour above dull earthy brown, 
so finely vermiculated as to appear almost uniform at first glance, a 
few fulvescent cross markings more conspicuous on the scapulars 
and secondaries, very slightly indicated on the hind neck, and not 
forming a distinct collar; crown of head rather blacker than the 
back, the feathers infinitesimally freckled with sandy rufous, the 
ear-tufts blackish, scarcely vermiculated at all; loral plumes dull 
rufous, barred with black, the shafts elongated into black hair-like 
bristles; feathers over the fore part of the eye buffy white, with 
black cross bars, scarcely forming a distinct eyebrow; forehead and 
sides of crown greyer than the crown itself, being greyish buff, minutely 
vermiculated with brown, and forming a lateral band which 
runs round the nape, being here rather lighter, several of the feathers 
barred with white; feathers in front of and above the eye dark 
brown; ear-coverts sandy brown, indistinctly barred across with 
blackish brown, and narrowly shaft-streaked with white, the hindermost 
ear-coverts tipped with black, and merging in the ruff, which 
is composed of sandy buff plumes, distinctly barred across with 
black, more narrowly on the gular feathers ; chin whitish; rest of 
under surface ochraceous buff, thickly sprinkled with wavy lines 
and vermiculations of dark brown, especially on the sides of the 

chest, some of the breast-feathers streaked with black and barred 
across with white, the flanks scantily barred with dark brown, inclining 
to white near the tip, the markings scanty, as also on the 
under tail-coverts; under wing-coverts nearly uniform ochraceous

buff, with a lew tiny spots of brown near the outer edge of the wing, 
the lower series ashy brown, resembling the quill-lining; scapulars 
externally yellowish buff, barred with dark brown, a few of the 
wing-coverts also largely spotted with yellowish on the outer web, 
the wing-coverts otherwise tolerably uniform like the back, the 
vermiculations a little more distinct; primary coverts dark brown, 
regularly barred across with sandy buff rather obscured with brown 
vermiculations; quills dark brown, barred with sandy buff, inclining 
to yellowish on the inner webs, the secondaries so closely vermiculated 
on the outer web that the light bars are nearly obscured, 
being, however, much more distinct on the outer webs of the primaries, 
inclining to white on the margins of the latter, and producing 
a chequered appearance ; tail dark brown, thickly vermiculated with 
sandy buff on the margins and at the tips, and crossed with bars of 
the same, eight or nine of which are distinguishable. Total length 
9*5 inches, wing 6*6, tail 3-9, tarsus 1*3. 

Adult female (rufous phase). General characteristics as in the grey 
phase, but rufous where the other bird is brown, and slightly more 
mottled on the upper surface with rufescent cross bars; below nearly 
uniform rufous, deeper on the chest, some of the feathers slightly 
streaked with black, more narrowly on the breast and abdomen; on 
the chest a few dull brown vermiculations, the abdomen indistinctly 
barred with fulvous. Total length 9 inches, wing 6-55, tail 3*4, 
tarsus 1*3. 

Obs. The principal characteristics of this race are the uniformity 
of its upper surface, and the comparative absence of streaks; scapulars 
fulvescent, not white. These remarks apply both to the 
brown and rufous phases, neither of which shows any collar on the 
hind neck.

Obs. Throughout Central America the Scops Owls have a very different 
aspect from those of South America: and although they have 
all been united together as Scops brasiltanus, the former are sufficiently 
well characterized to deserve a separate name. Scops guaterna^
ce, as I propose to call these birds, resembles 8. ustus in the more 
mottled, not streaked, character of the upper parts; but the chief 
point in which it differs from its South-American allies is in the 
entire absence of any yellow colouring on the underparts. 

The rufous phase of S. guatemalce is quite different from any thing 
that I have seen from South America, being entirely of a foxy rufous 
colour, with the head never darker than the back or showing any 
approach to a blackish patch; the back is generally rather narrowly 
streaked with black, as is also the head; and there are in some examples 
slight indications of bars.

Ob$. This is a dark brown form of 8, asio, with no rufous phase 
at all; moreover it is larger than the typical 8, asio. Full particulars 
will be found in Mr. Bidgway's work (B. N. A. iii. p. 53), 
where the whole subject is treated in a more exhaustive manner 
than the limits of the present volume will allow. 

The specimen described by me is very brown in coloration, and 
seems to represent the rufous phase of 8. asio; for other examples 
are decidedly greyer above and whiter below. Such a specimen

black, the gular plumes black in the centre, with narrow transverse 
lateral lines of the same; chin whitish; rest of under surface white, 
transversely lined with blackish brown, these cross lines springing 
from a very broad central streak of black, extremely wide on the

tail-coverts nearly entirely white, excepting a few sagittate markings 
of dark brown near the tips ; leg-feathers white, clothing the tarsi 
and extending on to the toes; under wing-coverts whitish, the 
outermost slightly streaked with brown, the lowest series ashy 
brown, resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are tolerably

Young. Yery similar to the adult, but much more dingy, the white 
spots on the scapulars and wing-coverts obscured by vermiculations, 
the three bands on the hind neck also very indistinct; under surface 
of body dull white, crossed with numerous dusky brown bars, the 
chest broadly streaked with dull brown down the centre of the 
feathers ; on the breast a few feathers are appearing white, streaked 
and narrowly barred with black, as in the fully adult plumage. 

Rufous phase (not quite adult). General colour rufous, the markings 
very similar in character to those of the grey phase, but not so

120 BUBONIDiE. 

Nestling. Above brown, the nestling plumes tipped with white, the 

hinder neck barred across with sandy brown; the scapulars with 

distinct white spots on the outer webs, and the spurious quills 

distinctly notched with white even at this early age; wings and 

tail marked much as in the adult, but more tinged with sandy 

brown; feathers of the face dull white, very distinctly barred with 

dusky brown, as also the underparts, which are white, barred with 

brown, wider and broader on the flanks and abdomen. 

Adult. General colour above grey, slightly browner on the head, 

the centres to the feathers very distinctly black, causing a streaked 

appearance, broader on the crown, the transverse vermiculations very 

coarse and distinct; scapulars externally white, tipped with black; 

forehead and lores greyish white, with black tips to the feathers, those 

round the eye whitish, mesially streaked with black, extending in 

an indistinct line on the sides of the crown to the ear-coverts, which 

are very plainly notched with white on the inner web, the hind neck 

mottled with fulvous, forming a tolerably distinct collar, the only 

one traceable on the upper surface; wing-coverts grey, like the back, 

and mottled in the same manner, the black streaks being broader 

and occupying the entire centre of the greater coverts, which are 

largely spotted with white at the tip of the outer web, the spurious 

quills externally notched with buffy white; primary-coverts dark 

brown, barred with whitish buff; quills dark brown, barred with 

fulvous on the inner web and also on the outer webs, which are fur


ther varied with greyish vermiculations on the exterior margin, the 

light bars inclining to white on the primaries, the inner secondaries 

very distinctly grey like the back, and mesially streaked in the same 

manner; tail grey, darker brown in the centre of the feathers, each 

of which is crossed with seven bars of pale fulvous brown, incJining 

to white on the outer webs of the .external feathers; sides of face 

dull greyish white, barred with black and distinctly tipped with the 

same, the ruff greyish white, slightly tinged with fulvous, and very 

finely barred with wavy lines of black, the stiff gular feathers broadly 

streaked with black, and distinctly barred with narrow lines of the 

same ; rest of under surface of body white, plainly though narrowly 

barred with zigzag lines of black, the chest very broadly streaked 

with black, these streaks becoming much narrower on the abdomen 

and flanks; the centre of the body white, as also the under tail-

coverts, the latter having only a few black cross markings near the 

tip; legs densely clothed with feathers, the tibia sandy brown, 
barred with blackish, the tarsus white but similarly barred; under 
wing-coverts yellowish, the edge of the wing and the adjacent feathers 
washed with sandy and barred with dark brown, the greater series 
ashy brown, resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are 
ashy brown below, notched with yellowish on the outer and barred 
with the same on the inner web; bill greenish horn-colour, the tip 
yellowish; iris yellow. Total length 9 inches, wing 6*3, tail 3*6, 
tarsus 1*35. 

Ohs. This is a small race of S. Jcennicotti; but, as far as can be 
determined, it has only a grey phase and no brown one. Its mea


.4. SCOPS. 121 

surements distinguish it at once; and it may also be told by its narrowly 
barred under surface, every feather being streaked with black 
and barred with the same, from the chin to the lower abdomen and 
flanks. It is larger than. 8cojp$ enano, and differs from that bird also 
in not having a rufous phase; the cross-barring of the under surface 
in the latter is of the same character in 8. enano as in JS. asio; that 
is to say, the bars are often double, whereas in S. trichopsis they are 
single and very distinct.

with sandy rufous, inclining here and there to whitish; primary-
coverts nearly uniform blackish brown, with a few bars of sandy 
rufous near the tips of the outer webs; quills blackish brown, the

Ohs. My description is taken from a specimen obtained at Calobre, 
in Vcragua, by Arce, and kindly lent to me by Mr. Salvin. He has 
at the same time lent me another specimen, obtained by the same 
collector in Costa Rica. This latter bird differs in several points 
from the one described, having more of the general aspect of Scojps 
spilocephalus of the Himalayas; it is clear sandy in colour, the black 
forming regular bars across the plumage, the subterminal one very 
broad, and giving the appearance of large black spots to the upper 
surface; feathers of the crown centred with black, the sandycoloured 
interspaces forming very distinct spots, the ear-tufts being 
still lighter, and barred across with whitish; the white spots on the 
scapulars, wing-coverts, and outer webs of primaries very distinct, 
as also are the white bars on the lower surface, many of them being 
apparent also on the chest-feathers; the quills barred with ashy 
brown on their inner webs, inclining to sandy buff on the secondaries. 
Total length 9*5 inches, wing 6-8, tail 4, tarsus 1*45, bare 
part of latter 0*65.

a whitish tip; lores and feathers in front of the eye white, dusky 
brown at tip, the ear-coverts more or less white at base; all the 
feathers, as far as developed, pure white, the least wing-coverts 
barred with blackish; greater wing-coverts and quills pure white, 
spotted on the outer web, and barred on the inner one with blackish,

clouded with dusky brown, as also are the scapulars, many of which 
are entirely dusky or greyish brown; round the hind neck the 
feathers are white, barred across with black, as also are those which 
are appearing on the breast, though here the dark bars are narrower;

the centre ones are remains of indistinct bars of black. 

Adult male (Upland, Sweden, Nov. 18th, 1872). Absolutely 
snowy white above and below, with only a few remains of longitudinal 
brown spots on the hinder part of the crown and on the wing-
coverts, the quills with also a few remains of bars; tail pure white, 
with a small brown spot remaining near the tip of the centre 
feathers; bill and claws blackish horn-colour; iris deep yellow.

only showing one or two dusky brown markings, the hind neck with 

5. NYCTEV. 127 
a larger number of brown-barred feathers; back and wing-coverts 
transversely barred with pale dusky brown, less distinctly characterized 
on the primary and outermost greater coverts; quills pure 
white, with a few more or less distinct spots of pale brown on the 
outer web, the inner web of the longest primaries having also some 
brown bars near the tip of the inner webs, the innermost secondaries 
obscurely clouded with pale brown, the cross bars very indistinct 
on all of these; lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts 
pure white, with here and there remains of pale brown cross markings, 
more distinct on the tail-coverts; tail itself pure white, the 
two outer feathers on each side unspotted, the rest having three 
rows of brown markings near the tips; forehead and entire face and 
throat pure unspotted white ; rest of under surface of body white, 
narrowly barred with dusky brown, these bars narrowing on the 
lower parts of the body, and being absent on the under tail-coverts 
and leg-feathers, the plumes on the latter completely hiding the 
entire foot, and even the nails; under wing-coverts pure white, as 
also is the inner lining of the quills, with the exception of a few 
dusky brown spots near the tips. Total length 20-5 inches, wing 
16*7, tail 9-1, tarsus about 2-35. 

Obs. Mr. Eidgway, in the third volume of the ' North-American 
Birds' (p. 61), wishes to separate the Snowy Owl into two races or 
"varieties," peculiar to the Old and New World respectively. The 
Palsearctic species he calls Nyctea scancliaca, var. scandiaca (vel nivea); 
and the Nearctic bird is separated as N. scandlaca, var. arctiea. The 
characters which he gives for separating them are the narrowness 
and darker brown shade of the bars in the American Snowy Owl. 
But this I cannot see; for on comparing a specimen from Norway 
with one from Labrador, there is no perceptible difference in the 
barring of the plumage. Adult birds are very similar; for I have 
before me perfectly white examples both from Sweden and from 
North America. 1 therefore do not agree with Mr. Eidgway in this 
separation into two races; and I believe that we have in the Snowy 
Owl an analogous case to the Greenland Jerfaleon (Eierofalco candicans), 
and that the differences of plumage can be accounted for by 
the age of the bird. The young birds are strongly barred; and these 
bars disappear as the individuals advance in age. The females seem 
never to get as free from transverse markings as the males; and I 
am entirely able to agree with Mr. Dresser on this point (B. of Eur. 
part xxiii.) ; or, at all events, if they ever become pure white, they 
take a longer time to lose the barred plumage; and in numerous 
other families of birds this is also known to be the case. At the 
same time I find a difference in the Snowy Owls of Europe and 
North America which seems to have escaped Mr. Eidgway's notice: 
this consists in the much greater amount of feathering of the 
toes in the European bird, the plumes completely hiding toe and 
nail, whereas in the American bird the nails always, and even the 
final joint of the toe occasionally, may be clearly seen. The following 
are the measurements of the Museum series :—

The Greenland birds agree with those from North America in not 
being quite so thickly feathered on the toes. I think it likely that 
an error in the sex has occurred in the two Liehtenfels examples. 
But little reliance can be placed on the tarsal measurements, owing 
to the extreme density of the feathers, which renders it almost impossible 
to obtain the exact dimensions.

Adult male. Above sepia-brown, everywhere strongly mottled with 
white, the bases of the feathers all white, but showing less on the 
back than the rest of the upper parts, though here the feathers are 
broadly barred with white, the bases being more or less concealed ; 
the scapulars externally pure white, forming a longitudinal patch; 
crown of head white, barred with dark brown, the bars more predominating 
and broader towards the nape, which is white varied

which occurs a large white spot of irregular shape, the primaries 
terminally margined with white, a little broader on the secondaries; 
upper tail-coverts broadly barred with brown and white ; tail ashy 
brown, crossed with nine narrow bars of dull white, all the feathers 
being broadly tipped with the same, the white cross bars purer in 
colour on the centre feathers, but obscured with brown towards the 
outermost ones, all the bars on the inner webs much broader and 
purer white; an indistinct eyebrow and sides of face white, the 
lores obscured by blackish bristles, the ear-coverts tipped with black, 
merging in a crescentic black line running down behind the ear-
coverts ; throat whitish, the chin obscured by black bristles like the 
lores; the chest white, excepting a few small specks of brown, and 
separated from the throat by a band of dusky brown feathers ; rest 
of under surface of body white, narrowly banded with brown, the 
bars disappearing on the abdomen and under tail-coverts, becoming 
broader again towards the tips of the latter ; leg-feathers yellowish 
white, with a few markings of dusky brown; under wing-coverts 
and axillaries white, thickly barred across with brown, the greater 
series with broad tips of brown, and thus resembling the inner lining

yellow; iris bright yellow. Total length 14 inches, wing 9*7, tail 
7*5, tarsus (about) 1. 

Young female. Similar to the adults, but having the feathers of 
the head more fluffy, pale brown in colour, narrowly tipped with a 
whitish apical bar; on the back of the wing a few basal markings 
of white are apparent on disarranging the feathers; in other respects 
the upper plumage is very similar to that of the adult, but is more 
dingy, and none of the white spots on the scapulars or wings are so 
large or distinct; the bars on the centre tail-feathers are whitish 
brown, and not pure white; the throat and sides of face are buffy 
white; there is no distinct white pectoral band, and the bars on the 
breast are more tinged with brown, while the tarsi are not so thickly 
feathered. Total length 13*2 inches, wing 9*2, tail 7. (Sharpe £f

manner as the back with oval spots of white, those on the greater 
series larger and more distinct; primary-coverts brown, notched on 
the outer web with white, these markings slightly tinged with 
rufous; quills brown, barred with paler brown, shading off into 
whitish on the inner web, and exhibiting a whitish notch on the 
outer one, producing a chequered appearance; upper tail-eoverts

brown, barred across with yellowish white ; tail brown, tipped with 
whitish and crossed with four other bands of whitish brown, the 
bands traversing the rectrices near the base, but incomplete towards 
the apex; head brown, thickly marked with triangular spots of 
white, with which all the feathers are streaked; on the nape a patch 
of white, the feathers being mostly of this colour, with broad terminal 
margins of brown; feathers of the face, as well as a distinct 
eyebrow, white, the lores blackish at tip, the ear-coverts also marked 
with brown; cheeks white, extending backwards in a triangular 
patch behind the ear-coverts; chin and fore neck white, separated 
from each other by a band of brown feathers across the throat; rest 
of under surface of body white, streaked with brown, some of the 
flank-feathers having also indications of cross markings of the same 
colour, the feathers of the upper breast barred and mottled with 
whitish; leg-feathers and under tail-coverts whitish, the latter with 
a few central markings .of brown; under wing-coverts whitish, inclining 
to yellow on the inner ones and axillaries, most of the under 
coverts being marked with brown near the base; inner lining of wing 
brown, the inner webs broadly barred and the outer webs spotted 
with yellowish; bill yellow, slightly tinged with greenish; feet 
greyish yellow; iris yellow. Total length 11*5 inches, wing 6*7, 
tail 3-5, tarsus 1 *3. 

The sizes of the sexes are given as below in Sharpe and Dresser's 

* Birds of Europe':— 
<J ad. Total length 8-2 inches, wing 6, tail 2*9, tarsus 1*1. 
5 ad. Total length 9 „ wing OT, tail 3, tarsus 1*1. 
I suspect that both these birds were really males, and that the 
specimen described by me above represents the female sex. 
Youna. Yery similar to the adult, but more dingy, especially on 
the lower surface, where the central markings to the feathers are 
ashy brown and very broad. All the characteristic markings of the 
adult are developed in the young bird; but the white markings on 
the upper parts are broader and more conspicuous than in the old 
bird, especially on the scapulars and upper wing-coverts. 
Rah. The continent of Europe, occurring as far north as Denmark, 
but only an occasional visitant in England or Scandinavia. In !N.E, 
Africa only near Tangier (Irby), thence along the northern shores 
of the Mediterranean to Asia Minor and Southern Russia generally. 
Its eastern range is as yet undefined.

Adult female. General colour pale fawn-brown, mottled all over 
with white spots, more or less concealed on the back, and plainer on 
the scapulars and greater wing-coverts, the latter being rather darker 
brown on their inner webs ; primary-coverts and quills dark brown, 
tipped with white and broadly barred on the inner web with white, 
this bar not extending across the feathers, but represented on the 
outer web with a white notch, producing a chequered appearance ; 
upper tail-coverts pale fawn-brown, rather more rufous than the 
back, largely spotted with white, which occupies the basal half of 
the feather; tail pale fawn-colour, tipped with whitish and crossed 
with four bands of buffy white, continuous near the base, the apical 
bands, however, not completely traversing the feather; head rather 
darker fawn-brown than the back, streaked with white down the 
centre of the feathers, dilating towards the tip into a distinct white 
spot; hind neck white, the feathers being mottled with brown, most 
of the feathers edged and tipped with the latter colour; facial aspect 
white, the lores with dark brown shaft-stripes, the ear-coverts also 
broadly streaked with brown; cheeks white, continued in a triangular 
patch to behind the ear-coverts; chin and fore neck pure white, 
separated from each other by a band of feathers of a pale rufous fawncolour; 
rest of under surface of body pure white, broadly streaked 
with rufous fawn-colour, these streaks becoming narrower on the 
abdomen and disappearing on the under tail-coverts; leg-feathers 
entirely white; under wing-coverts white, the inner ones and the 
axillaries washed with yellowish, the outer ones streaked with brown,

the greater series dark brown at "base, ashy brown at tip, resembling 
the inner lining of the wing, which is ashy brown, broadly barred 
with white on the inner web; bill and irides pale yellow. Total 

ength 10*5 inches, wing 7, tail 3S, tarsus 1-25. 
Adult male. Similar to the female. Total length 9*5 inches, 
wing 6*4, tail 3*6, tarsus 1*25. 

Nestling. Dusky brown, and covered with down of this same 
colour, the white spots on the wing-coverts very strongly developed, 
the latter nearly entirely white, with central streaks of brown ; the 
greater coverts brown, the outer webs whitish * quills brown, tipped 
with ashy grey, the outer webs notched with rufous buff; under 
surface dull white, with central streaks of brown. 

The above description is from a nestling collected by Mr. L. 
Eraser, and having the feathers only slightly developed. An older 
bird, obtained from the same collector, exhibits the markings of an 
adult bird, but is very much dingier, as is a fully grown young individual 
shot by Mr. Edward Eartlett, near Cairo. This bird is 
dark brown, mottled with whitish or buff, and very closely resembles 
the young of (7. noctua. The under surface is whitish, streaked 
with brown, the latter colour entirely predominating, and giving a 
clouded appearance to the lower parts; quills and tail dull brown, 
crossed with five bands of fulvous or pale fawn-colour; head almost 
uniform, with scarcely any fulvous spots. 

This species is certainly very closely allied to G. noctua; and the 
young appear to be almost indistinguishable from each other. It 
may be regarded as a desert form of the European bird, with a 
distinct range, being pale fawn-colour where 0. noctua is dark 
brown: hence it has a generally pale appearance. On raising the 
wing the inner lining in C. glaux is very pale, and inclines to ashy 
brown, the white bars on the inner web very broad and contrasting 
strongly, the bars on the inner web of the first primary being four 
in number. In G. noctua the wing-lining is much darker brown, 
and only three bars are apparent on the inner web of the first primary, 
all the bars on the inner web being not quite so broad. These 
differences of wing-coloration are really very little more than part 
of the general pale tone predominant in G. glaux, and hardly constitute 
specific characters. The specimen of (7. noctua from Greece 
is so thoroughly intermediate, that I am inclined to look upon the 
two birds as races of one form.

Adult (type of species). General colour deep fawn-brown, the 
head streaked with burly whitish, all the streaks dilating towards 
their tips, some of which have a subterminal spot; hind neck largely-
mottled with white, many of the feathers broadly barred across with 
white, the outer webs of many of them also of the latter colour; 
interscapulary region tolerably uniform, the white spots being concealed, 
but very distinct and oval in shape on the scapulars; wing-
coverts coloured like the back, and distinctly spotted with white, 
the spots on the median and greater coverts larger and more oval in 
form; primary-coverts dusky brown, barred across with fawn-colour ; 
quills brown, rather more dusky at tip, barred across with lighter 
and more rufous brown, the ends of the feathers greyish white, all 
the rufescent bars shading off into a white spot on the outer web, 
and giving a chequered appearance to the wing; upper tail-coverts 
fawn-colour, the bases white; tail pale fawn-colour, tipped with 
whitish, and crossed with five rather irregular bands of fulvous 
fawn; lores pure white, as also a small superciliary streak, the 
former with black shaft-lines; ear-coverts fawn-colour, with whitish 
shaft-streaks, the feathers under the eye whitish; cheeks and throat 
white, extending in a triangular patch backwards below the ear-
coverts ; lower part of fore neck white, separated from the throat 
by a band of rufescent feathers mottled with whitish; rest of under 
surface fawn-buff, inclining to white on the centre of the body, 
streaked with rufous brown, the centres to the feathers very broad 
and distinct on the breast, much narrower on the sides of body, and 
absent altogether on the lower flanks, vent, and under tail-coverts; 
leg-feathers whitish, light fawn on their outer aspect; under wing-
coverts whitish, with a few slight markings of brown here and there, 
the lower series whitish at base, ashy brown at tip, and thus resembling 
the inner lining of the quills, which are pale ashy brown, 
barred with bufTy white on the inner web. Total length 8 inches, 
wing 6'1, tail 3*4, tarsus 1*15, (Mus. R. Swinhoe.)

Ols. The typical specimen of Athene jplumipes, which. Mr. Swinhoe 
has lent me, differs, as he has himself pointed out, from C. glaux 
in having the toes more feathered. Latterly M. Severtzoff has described, 
from Turkestan, a small Owl, which he separates as Athene 
orientalis, on the self-same characters (cf. Dresser, Z. c). "With regard 
to Mr. Blanford's remarks on the Thibetan bird from Hodgson's 
collection, of which a single example only is to be found in 
the Museum, he is quite right that Hodgson never published a name 
for,the species. Mr. G. E. Gray identified it as Athene midipes 
(Miss.), and he indicates that the Dame of Athene gymnojpus had 
been given by Hodgson to the bird; but no such name occurs in 
the list published by the latter gentleman in J. E. Gray's ' Zoological 
Miscellany' (/. c), while his drawing of the species (no. 876) 
bears, in his handwriting, the name of lagopus, evidently much more 
in accordance with the feathered foot of the bird than midipes or 
gymnojpus. As, however, no description of this Thibetan specimen 
was ever published, the name given by Mr. Swinhoe will have to be 
used if the species should not ultimately prove to be the true A. hactriana 
of Hutton, with which Mr. G. Ii. Gray identified it.

Adult male. General colour above slaty brown, with more or less 
concealed spots of white, very small on the head, where they are 
rather plainly defined; hind neck barred with white, forming an 
indistinct kind of collar; scapulars barred across with white, broader 
on the outer web; wing-coverts dark slaty colour, externally notched 
with white, the median and greater series with large rounded spots 
of white on the outer web; primary-coverts and quills dark slatecolour, 
notched on the outer web and barred on the inner one with 
white; tail slaty brown, crossed with six narrow bars of white, 
rather broader on the outer feather; forehead and eyebrow white, 
the lores developing into hair-like bristles; fore part of cheeks 
whitish; ear-coverts dark slaty, barred aoros3 with white; entire 

throat white, extending backwards in a triangular patch, below the 
ear-coverts, a black mark running down the sides of the neck; rest 
of under surface white, barred with ashy brown, the bars getting 
fainter on the lower flanks; leg-feathers and under tail-coverts pure 
white; under wing-coverts white, the lower series ashy brown at 
tip, and resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are ashy 
brown below, barred with white; bill brownish, the tip and the 
culmen greenish yellow. Total length 8 inches, wing 5-5, tail 3*5, 
tarsus 1*05. (Mus. R. G. Wardlaw-Ramsay.) 

Obs. The above description is taken from a Thayetmyo skin, collected 
by Lieut. Wardlaw-Eamsay, and kindly lent me by Lord 
"Walden. Mr. Hume has also been so good as to lend me a bird 
from the same place; but it does not show the characters so well as 
the bird described by me. His skin measures *.—Total length 7 
inches, wing 5*4, tail 3*1, tarsus 1*1. I consider that C.pulchra 
may very fairly be separated from 0. brama, as the characters seem 
quite constant, to judge from three other Burmese specimens examined 
by me in Lord Walden's collection. Mr. Hume also writes:— 
" I have now four good specimens before me, two of them sent by 
Mr. Oates; and it appears to me certain that they must be separated. 
I do not suppose that these birds weigh much more than half what 
our Indian ones do. In length they vary from 7*25 to 7*8 inches 
against 8 to 9*5 inches in C. brama, while the wings vary from 5-3 
to 5*8 inches against 6 to 6'65 inches; and an expanse of 19 to 
19*5 inches against 21 to 22*5 inches in the Indian bird. No doubt 
the general character of the plumage is the same as in (7. brama; 
but the spotting of the head is smaller and neater. The general 
colour of the upper surface is a darker and purer brown; the dark 

8. HETEROGLATTX. 141 
throat-band is more strongly marked. The tail exhibits five or six 
narrow transverse bands, or traces of these, against four or five far 
broader and more distinctly marked bands in C. brama. The scapulars, 
too, seem to be generally less barred and more spotted than 
is usually the case in Indian specimens. 

" Generally the birds have a very different appearance, and, I 
think, would be separated by any one who examined a series of 
both; but no mere description will sufficiently explain this difference, 
and the very marked difference in size is the character that 
must be first relied on for separating the species/'

Adult. General colour sandy brown, the head distinctly marked 
with oval streaks of buffy whitish, some of the feathers also transversely 
barred with the same; hind neck more mottled with whitish, 
the feathers having a broad subterminal bar of this colour; back 
mottled with white spots and bars on all the feathers, the latter 
being often concealed and of a sandy buff colour; scapulars broadly 
barred across with white; wing-coverts sandy brown, a little darker 
than the back, spotted with white, the greater and median coverts 
with a large spot of white near the tip of the outer web, all this 
series of coverts being also barred with sandy buff; primary-coverts 
brown, barred with sandy buff; quills brown, tipped with whitish 
and barred with sandy brown, broadly on the inner web, the outer 
web notched with buffy whitish, especially the secondaries ; tail-
feathers brown, tipped with whitish and crossed with five other 
bands of sandy buff, inclining to whitish on the centre feathers, the 
bars with a conterminous shade of brown both above and below; 
lores and an indistinct eyebrow whitish, the former obscured by 
black hair-like shaft-lines; ear-coverts brown, streaked with fulvous 
just behind the eye; cheeks whitish, extending backwards 
behind the ear-coverts; throat and fore neck white, separated from 
each other by a band of sandy buff feathers, barred with darker

sandy brown, these bars decreasing in width on the lower part of 
the body, and being entirely absent on the under tail-coverts, the 
sides of the upper breast more thickly barred with brown; thighs 
yellowish buff, perfectly uniform, the tarsi also clothed near the top 
with feathers of the same colour; under wing-coverts yellowish 
buff, the outermost white, as also the edge of the wing, the greater 
series dark brown at tip ; quills brown, barred across with lighter 
brown, inclining to sandy buff, the bases of the inner webs entirely 
of the latter colour ; bill greyish yellow, darker at base ; feet dusky 
grey, claws black; iris yellow. Total length 9 inches, wing 6-8, 
tail 3*6, tarsus 1*95. 

The above is probably a female, as a sexed male measures—total

gloss; rest of under surface covered with creamy buff down, the 
ordinary feathers on the chest commencing to appear; wings and tail 
apparently like the adult; leg-feathers white, and reaching nearly to 
the base of the toes. (Mus. Paris.)

Ohs. The Chilian birds are much larger than those from Central 
America or the United States, and measure in the wing 6-95-7*4 
inches (Mr. Ridgway even gives 7*5 inches • and the Tinta specimen 
in the collection reaches to 7*8 inches); whereas the wing of the 
northern bird varies from 6*45-7*25 inches. Specimens, however, 
from the Tambo valley are somewhat intermediate in plumage, and 
measure 6-6-6*7 inches in the wing; their tarsus, however, is the 
shortest of any, viz. 1*5 inch. Mr. Ridgway, however, has examined 
one which measured 1*8 inch in the tarsus; and therefore we come to 
the conclusion that the species is subject to great variation, and that 
it is impossible to define distinct races by constant characters. The 
bands on the tail are generally six in the North-American birds, and 
seven in the Chilian * but of nine specimens examined by me, two had 
six and two had onlyfive bands: so this character is equally inconstant. 

The following are a few notes on the series examined by me:— 
British Columbia. Three specimens from the western side of the 

9. SPE0TYT0. 
145 
Rocky Mountains, collected by the late Mr. J. K. Lord, have fallen 
under my notice. They are all very much alike in the character of 
their markings; but one is much more sandy-coloured than the 
others, the spots on the upper surface, and also the bands on the 
tail, being distinctly sandy buff instead of whitish• all have six 
bands on the tail, including the one at the tip. The throat-band, in 
two out of the three birds, is blackish brown, with fulvous cross bars 
on the feathers. The measurements are as follows;—

California. One specimen before me from this country seems to 
be a younger bird; it is of a dark earthy brown, covered with little 
oval spots of sandy buff, the crown-spots rather more longitudinal 
than those of the back; the bars on the tail are sandy-coloured also; 
so that I suspect the tail-bands grow whiter with age. Underneath 
the same dark tint prevails; the throat-band and sides of chest 
earthy brown, mottled with spots and bars of sandy buff or fulvous 
white; the bands on the breast and flanks very broad and rather 
rufous, not perceptibly narrowing towards the flanks. Another 
specimen, though not adult, is rather older than the one above 
mentioned; the head is slightly barred, and the spots on the upper 
plumage whitish, as also the bars on the tail. A third specimen 
does not seem to differ from the British-Columbian birds, but is very 
bleached. The three above-mentioned specimens have the following 
measurements:—

At the same time I must observe that the birds considered to be

description of the latter plumage. 

Mexico. Specimens from this country are the same as the jSTorth-
American ones, and I cannot see any difference at all. In three 
specimens procured from Mr. Boucard, two have rather broader bands 
on the breast, being probably younger birds. They measure as follows

San Domingo. The British Museum contains two specimens from 
this island; and, after examining them carefully, I fail to find any 
good reason why they should have been separated from the ordinary 
North-American bird. The bars are narrower on the under surface 
when compared with examples from other countries; but as I believe 
these bars narrow with age, I cannot look upon them as evidencing 
specific distinctness. The under wing-coverts are also spotted with 
brown near the outer edge; but this is a character which seems to 
obtain in certain specimens from South America, though at present 
I have not seen any from North America which had any markings 
on the under wing-coverts.

Chili. I have examined a series of nine specimens from this 
country, all of them collected by Mr. E. C. Eced. Placed side by 
side with the North-American skins, they present a very much 
darker aspect, and are decidedly larger. I have not as yet seen 
a light-coloured bird from Chili. The bars on the tail vary very 
much in number, being five in two specimens, six in the next 
two, and seven in the remaining five. This character, therefore, 
cannot be regarded as of specific worth; and, indeed, I think Mr, 
Eidgway perfectly right in looking at the Chilian bird as merely a 
large representative form of the North-American Burrowing-Owl. 
I give the measurements of the nine Chilian specimens examined 

by me.

In all the above the character given by Mr. Eidgway, of the 

9 . SPTSOTYTO. 147 
greater extent of white on the quills and tail-feathers, holds good; 
and although the character is variable to a great extent, these 
southern specimens always seem to have the tarsi more densely 
feathered than northern examples. 

Peru. Mr. Bidgway separates the Burro wing-Owls of this country 
as S. grallaria (Spix). The difference given for this separation are 
the following characters:—"Brown markings of the lower parts 
irregularly transverse and ragged. "White spots on the upper parts 
nearly equal in extent to the brown. Wing 6*15-6*40, tail 2*903-
60, culmen -58-*62, tarsus 1*50-1-80, middle toe 0*65." Three 
specimens collected by Mr. Whitely give the following dimensions;—

The first of these three specimens has seven bars on the tail, and 
is identical with the large Chilian form. The Tambo-valley examples 
are very small, and are much more largely spotted with 
white than any other birds which have come under my notice; the 
tails are imperfect, but appear to have five bands. They are slightly 
darker than the ]^orth-A.meriean specimens, and are, perhaps, a 
small race of the Chilian form.

Adult. Yery dark earthy brown, spotted on the entire upper 
surface with sandy isabelline, these spots being much smaller on 
the head and interscapular region, more distinct and larger on the 
hind neck; wing-coverts deeper brown than the back, the least 
ones minutely spotted with isabelline, the median and greater 
coverts, as well as the scapulars, having larger and paler spots of 
the same colour * primary coverts nearly uniform blackish brown, 
with a slight indication of a single fulvous notch on the outer web; 
quills dark brown, with faintly indicated bars of sandy-buff on the 
inner web, represented by a notch of the same colour on the outer 
one, these markings more distinct on both webs of the secondaries; 
tail dark earthy brown, crossed with five rows of sandy-buff spots 
(counting the terminal band), the basal one very indistinct * lores 
dull white, obscured by blackish bristles; forehead and a narrow 
superciliary streak sandy buff; ear-coverts very dark brown, slightly 
shaded with fulvous, the feathers under the eye minutely barred 
with sandy buff; cheeks buffy white, extending backwards in a 
triangular patch behind the ear; throat and fore neck also buffy 
white, separated from each other by a band of dark brown feathers,

and abdomen a little the broader ; the sides of the upper breast very 
dark brown, spotted and barred with buffy white; thigh-feathers 
deep fulvous, the tarsi very scantily feathered; under tail-coverts 
whitish, unspotted; under wing-coverts ochraceous buff, mottled 
with brown markings, the lower series ochraceous at base, dark 
brown at tip, thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which 
are very dark brown, with only four bars on the inner web. Total

Primaries of S. cunicularia, to show pattern of coloration. 

The specimen described agrees very well with the race called by 
Mr. Bidgway Speotyto cunieularia, var. guadeloupensis; and coming 
from neighbouring islands, these birds are very probably identical. 
The above account was written before I had consulted Mr. Ridgway's 
book, and it will be seen how well the main characters agree 
with his description. "Primaries without broad or regular bars of 
whitish on either web; primary-coverts plain brown; brown markings 
on the lower parts regularly transverse, and equal in extent to 
the white; white spots on the upper parts very small, reduced to 
mere specks on the dorsal region. "Wing 6-40, tail 3*40, culmen *60, 
tarsus 1-82, middle toe 0-85. Outer tail-feathers and inner webs 
of primaries with the light (ochraceous) bars only about one fourth 
as wide as the brown (disappearing on the inner quills)." 

There is evidently some little difference between the age of Mr. 

10 . 0YMNASIO. 149 
Ridgway's example and the one in the Museum, witness the greater 
appearance of bars on the quill-lining, and the slight evidence of a 
bar on the primary coverts; the character of the regular transverse 
barring of the underparts seems to have struck us both. 

The foregoing cuts show the difference in the markings on the 
quills and primary-coverts in $. cunicuhria and S. guadeloujpemis.

" The female bird seems to be more rufous than the male, with the

specimens which seem to be fully adult to judge from, these distinctions 
may be the result of age rather than of sex." (Neivton 1, c.)

Obs. Having examined the type of Ninox madagascanensis in the 
Paris Museum, I failed to see the slightest difference between this 
supposed Madagascar species and ordinary Nlnow higubris of the 
Himalayas ; and therefore I unite them, believing that some mistake 
as to locality has arisen. At the same time it must be remembered 
that the Cuckoo (Cucidus rocM) from Madagascar is almost inseparable 
from that of the Himalayas; and therefore it is by no means 
improbable that a JSIinox may appear in that island. But at present 
the evidence is against such a genus being found there; for none of the 
recent travellers have found an example. The more " guttate " spots 
of which Mr. Gurney (Ibis, 1869, p. 453) speaks, are, in my opinion, 
only a sign of maturity; for in all the species of Ninow the markings 
on the belly appear to be at first streaked and afterwards to break 
up into spots, perhaps without an actual moult of the feather.

Adult (type of Athene malaccensis*). Above deep chocolate-brown, 
the head slightly darker, the scapulars with concealed white bars ; 
wing-coverts exactly like the back and equally uniform, the primary-
coverts blackish, quills dark brown, slightly washed externally 
with ochre, the primaries inclining to rufous ochre towards their 
tips, all the wing-feathers nearly uniform, with no lighter cross 
bands, the inner secondaries barred with white, but these bars 
entirely concealed; upper tail-coverts uniform chocolate-brown like 
the back; tail-feathers ashy brown, rather paler at tips, and crossed 
with five blackish bands (one basal and concealed); sides of face 
chocolate-brown, as also the sides of the neck, the latter slightly 
washed with rufous; forehead and lores whitish, the latter obscured 
by blackish shaft-lines; chin whitish, slightly streaked with brown ; 
rest of under surface rufous chocolate, the throat washed with buff, 
the breast varied with white, generally as if streaked, the margins 
to the feathers being whitish; on the abdomen the white predominating 
and cutting across the feather, so as to form an oval spot of 
brown at the tips of the abdominal plumes, leg-feathers brown; 
under tail-coverts whitish; under wing-coverts rufous chocolate, 
the inner feathers washed and barred with ochraceous buff, the edge 
of the wing whitish; the greater series sepia-brown, nearly uniform, 
excepting for a few ochraceous bars near the base, thus resembling 
the inner lining of the wing, which is sepia-brown, with a few 
ochraceous bars near the base of the quills. Total length 12-5 
inches, wing 8-4, tail 4-8, tarsus 1*1. 

Obs. In the Transactions of the Zoological Society (viii. p. 40) 
Lord Walden has already clearly shown the confusion which reigns 
with regard to the various species of Nino®, thereby inducing me 
to pay particular attention to this subject. I have examined the 
series of specimens in the Norwich Museum (to the authorities of 
which I return my best acknowledgments) and in the collection of 
Mr. Swinhoe; and I think that I cannot do better than place before 
my readers the results of my studies of the birds from different 
localities. 

India. The Museum contains a tolerable series from the Himalayas, 
the measurements being as follows: — 

* This bird is described as being most probably the same as the typical 
Sumatran N. scutulata (Raffl.).

It Trill be seen below that in point of size the Chinese and Himalayan 
species are very closely allied; but the latter is quite a distinct 
bird. Mr. Andrew Anderson marks a specimen as " young " which appears 
to me to be quite old; and I mention this because it is a question 
to be decided by field observers in India. The Indian species is 
light-coloured, and when fully adult has a grey head, with a good 
deal of white about the face and cheeks. I do not know whether 
it ever has a striped abdomen; but, from the variations in the form 
of the central markings on the breast-feathers, I should expect that 
the young birds are streaked in their first plumage, and that these 
broad streaks break up, leaving sub terminal spots. The uniformity 
of the first primary and the lower series of wing-coverts is also a 
character which we might expect to find in the young stages, these 
feathers being barred in the older birds. I leave these points to 
the consideration of some of my Indian fellow workers to determine. 
The tail-bands vary in the series under examination from 5 to 6. 

Malabar. The only specimen which I have seen is one recently 
brought to the Museum by Mr. Whitely. Mr. Jerdon has united 
all the Indian birds under one title ; and in this he is generally followed. 
Lord Walden seems to hint (vide p. 157) that the Himalayan 
bird, Ninooo nipalmm of Hodgson, is distinct from the species 
of the peninsula of India, N. litgubris, Tickcll; and I incline to the 
belief that the two are distinct: with only one specimen, however, 
it is impossible to decide; but the Malabar skin is more nearly 
allied to the Ceylon bird than to the Himalayan. Total length 
11 inches, wing 8, tail 4*6, tarsus 1-1. 

Ceylon. Three specimens are before me, all apparently adult. 
The Ceylon birds present a very marked fades, being very darkcoloured, 
and having the abdominal spots large and distinct but very 
thickly distributed; this gives a dark appearance to the underparts. 
First primary uniform in all three specimens. The bars on the tail 
vary in each bird, being respectively 5, 6, and 7 in number. 

* Marked by Mr. Anderson as 7*7 in the flesh: perhaps we measure in a 
different way; and I had better state, therefore, that in the present work all the 
wings of the small Owls are measured with compasses, those of the larger 
species with a tape.

I subjoin a detailed description made from a Ceylonese specimen ; 
and if proved to be distinct, the bird will bear the title of Nlnox 
liirsuta (Temm.). 

Adult. Above uniform deep chocolate-brown, the head slightly 
darker and more blackish; sides of face uniform with crown, the 
lores dull whitish at base, but the frontal feathers more distinctly 
whitish; scapulars marked with large white spots, extending on to 
both webs; upper tail-coverts with a few scarcely distinguishable 
whitish spots; wing-coverts coloured like the back, and perfectly 
uniform, the primary-coverts blackish ; quills dark chocolate-brown, 
the primaries with a few nearly obsolete bands of light brown, 
shading off into greyish on the outer web, the inner secondaries 
barred with white on each web, some of them being concealed; 
tail-feathers clear ashy brown, plainly tipped with white, and 
crossed with five black bands on the centre feathers, six on the 
outer ones; throat dusky chocolate, streaked with ochraceous, with 
wThich colour some of the feathers are margined; remainder of 
under surface dark chocolate-brown, the breast-feathers being margined 
with white, producing a streaked appearance; the abdomen 
broadly barred with white, the browrn spots slightly tinged with 
rufous; leg-feathers brown, mottled with fulvous bars and streaks; 
under tail-coverts white, with a few blackish spots; under wing-
coverts deep chocolate-brown, slightly barred with ochre, the edge 
of the wing white, the greater series sepia-brown, thus resembling 
the inner lining of the wing, which is almost uniform brown, only 
the secondaries having a few fulvescent bars near the base; bill 
green; feet dingy yellow; iris yellow. Total length 12 inches, 
wing 8*1, tail 5*1, tarsus 1*05. 

Nicobar Islands, Lord Walden has kindly lent me a female collected 
on Trinkut by Captain Wimberley; and I am unable to separate 
it from Burmese specimens of N. scutulata. It has remains of 
fulvous bars near the base of the first primary, and has six bars on 
the tail. Total length 12 inches, wing 7*4, tail 5, tarsus 1*05. It 
seems to be rather smaller than the Burmese birds; and that is all 
the difference I can trace. 

China. I have examined a good series of Ninox jajponicus, which 
I will treat of in the order of their localities. I have not yet seen a 
typical Japanese example. 

Peking. The Norwich Museum contains a specimen obtained at 
Peking by Mr. Whitely. It is a bird of largo size; and the head 
varies very little in colour from the rest of the upper surface. Dark 
bars on tail five. Tarsus tolerably well-feathered to within about 0*3 

160 BVBQmVxE. 

inch of the base of middle toe. The following is a description of this 

specimen, which I take to be the true iV". jajponica (Schl.) :— 

Adult. Above chocolate-brown, the head slightly darker than the 

back, the scapulars with half-coneealed bars and spots of white, very 

large, and in some instances nearly traversing the feathers; wing-

coverts uniform chocolate-brown, as also the primary-coverts; quills 

dark brown, barred with paler brown, some of the lighter bars in


clining on the outer web to fulvous, the bars on the secondaries much 

less distinct and narrower, except on the inner web, where they are 

broader and fulvous white; upper tail-coverts uniform like the back; 

tail light brown, tipped narrowly with whitish, and crossed with five 

bands of darker brown, the subterminal one rather broader than the 

others; lores and frontal plumes whitish, with hair-like blackish 

bristles directed forwards over the nostrils; cheeks and chin whitish, 

with dark brown streaks, the rest of the under surface pure white, 

thicldy streaked with dark brown, the centres to the feathers being 

of this colour and very broad, but narrowing towards the base of the 
plume, and often severing the central streak into two spots, the 
subterminal one being generally oval in shape, and forming on the 
flank-feathers lateral bars of white; leg-feathers brown, mottled 
with fulvous; under tail-coverts pure white, with a few brown 
markings down the centre of some of the feathers; under wing-
coverts brown, streaked with fulvous, the inner ones especially fulvescent, 
the median series and the axillars white, barred or spotted 
with brown, the lower series dark brown, spotted with fulvous bars 
on the inner web, resembling the inner lining of the quills, which 
are dark brown below, barred with fulvous on the inner web. Total 
length 11 inches, wing 8'6, tail 5, tarsus 1*05. 

Chefoo. Prom this place Mr. Swinhoe has three specimens, collected 
in May 1873 and on the 15th of October 1874. Two of them 
have five, but the third six bands on the tail; the chief peculiarity 
lies in the reddish shade on the wing-coverts, which are thereby 
decidedly lighter than the back. The under surface of the body is 
very thickly streaked with rufous chocolate, the lower flanks barred 
with this colour; and from the markings on the abdomen it is evident 
that this change from broad central streaks to terminal spots 
is gained not by a moult, but by a gradual change in the pattern of 
the feather. The immature birds seem to have at the same time 
remains of fulvous on the breast, the margins to the feathers being 
of this colour. One of the male specimens killed at Chefoo in May 
is not so rufous on the wings as the other, and has the first primary 
perfectly uniform. 

Foochow. Three of Mr. Swinhoe's specimens obtained here are in 
the Norwich Museum. Two of them resemble the Chefoo birds 
almost exactly, having the first primary unbarred. The third specimen, 
however, is different from any yet examined by me, for the 
general colour of the back is rufpus brown, the head more greyish, 
and contrasting with the rest of the upper surface; the first primary 
is plainly barred below. The bands on the tail in all three speci


11 . ETTNOX. 161 
mens are five in number; but the tail is shaded with rufous in the 

reddish brown bird, grey in the others. 

Fohien. In the British Museum is a specimen, presented by Mr. 

Gould, which is thoroughly intermediate between the rufous and 

grey plumages mentioned m the foregoing paragraph. The general 

colour of the bird is the usual chocolate-brown; but it is shaded with 

rufous on the back, and has the hind neck decidedly rufous. The 

bands on the tail are five, and the abdominal streaks are well broken 

up and the spots distinct. The first primary is nearly uniform, but 

has indications of apparently developing bars of rufous on the inner 

web. 

Formosa, A specimen is in the Norwich Museum procured from the 

Maison Yerreaux, but bearing no evidence of Mr. Swinhoe's collect


ing. It seems to be not quite adult, and has the scapulars rather 

browner than the back, the concealed white spots being for the most 

part tinged with fulvous; the wings decidedly rufescent; tail with 

Ave bars; bars on first primary pretty plain; abdominal streaks of 

irregular shape, with the subterminal spot nearly separate in some 

feathers. 

Amoy* I have examined two specimens from Amoy, collected by 
Mr. Swinhoe. They are both in the ordinary chocolate plumage, 
with no perceptible difference in the colour of the head; the wings 
also are not particularly rufescent. Bands on tail five. The stripes 
on the abdomen in both specimens are in process of dissolution; but 
one (killed in November 1866) seems to be a little younger than the 
other, for it has a decided fulvous tinge on the under parts, and the 
first primary has no bars; whereas the other specimen is not so 
fulvescent below, and has indications of bars on the first primary. 

Tingchow. The single bird in Mr. Swinhoe's collection from this 
locality was killed in August 1867, and is smaller than any of the 
other Chinese specimens yet examined (ef. table of measurements 
given below). It seems to be a fully adult bird, with the spots on 
the abdomen thoroughly separate and the chest-streaks narrowed. 
The colour is uniform chocolate, the head resembling the back, the 
wings with a scarcely perceptible rufous tinge. Bars on tail six, 
the basal one completely hidden by the tail-coverts. Pirst primary 
with distinct fulvous bars on the inner web. 

Hainan. Mr. Swinhoe collected a male and female in this island 
on the 29th of March, 1868. The former is the smaller bird; but 
otherwise they resemble each other, both being nearly uniform chocolate, 
with very little rufous on the wings. They are both somewhat 
washed with fulvous below, and have each fire bars on the tail, 
the streaks on the abdomen being irregular in shape and breaking 
up into spots, and the bars on the first primary are plainly to be 
seen. 

The following are the general measurements of the series examined

From a comparison of the Chinese birds it appears that those 
from the southern portion of the empire are rather smaller, and 
appear to me to have the feathering of the tardus extended a little 
more to the base of the toes ; but this character, even if constant, is 
very slightly developed, and by no means easy to affirm with certainty. 
The younger birds appear to me to be more rufescent, and 
to have, as a rule, the bars on the first primary less plainly distinguishable. 


Eastern KiangsL A male procured by Pere David in this district, 
and now in the Paris Museum, recalls exactly Mr. Swinhoe's Hainan 
and Tingchow specimens: breast streaked and tinged with fulvous ; 
abdomen spotted, the spots commencing to occur also on the lower 
breast; first primary with a few bars; tail with five bars. Total 
length 10-5 inches, wing 8*3, tail 4*7, tarsus 1*05. 

Yun-nan. Dr. Anderson obtained a male bird at Quaylom, on the 
banks of the Tah-peng river, on the 3rd of February, 1875. It has 
no bars on the first primary, but has five bands on the tail. Total 
length 11 inches, wing 8*5, tail 5-1, tarsus 1-2. 

Burmali. Only three specimens have come under my notice from 
this locality, two of them being lent to me by Dr. Anderson. A bird 
from Bhamo is apparently adult, and has the first primary uniform, 
with four bands on the tail. Total length 12 inches, wing 8*4, tail 
5*25, tarsus 1*15. A female from Sawaddy, Upper Burmah, has 
distinct fulvous bars on the first primary, and six bars on the tail. 
Total length 12-5 inches, wing 8*2, tail 5*4, tarsus 1*2. Another 
specimen from Rangoon has the first primary uniform, except for 
indications of fulvous bars near the extreme base; tail with five 
bands, but one of the middle feathers having six bands and no white 

tip. Total length 11*5 inches, wing 8*1, tail 5*5, tarsus 3-15. 

Cochin CM?ia. Two specimens are in the Paris Museum from this 

* Although labelled with a ticket of Mr. Swinhoe's, this specimen bears every 
trace of being a Malaccan skin, and, as will be seen on comparison, it agree's 
exactly with the "Malayan bird in measurements. I think it very probable that 
the ticket has been accidentally changed on this bird.

country. The first, obtained by Diard, resembles Mr. Swinhoe's 

South-China birds: the spots on the under surface everywhere very 

distinct and regular, forming bars across the feathers* bands on tail 

four, -with no perceptible trace of a fifth; first primary with a distinct 

fulvous bar near the base. Total length 12 inches, wing 8'25, tail 

5*4, tarsus 1*1. Another specimen, collected by Germain, is rather 

younger than the foregoing, the chest being washed with fulvous and 

broadly streaked with brown, the belly having 
a more spotted 

appearance and being more broken up into spots and bars; first pri


mary to all intents quite uniform; bars on tail five, with indications 

of a sixth. Total length 11-5 inches, wing 8, tail 5*5, tarsus 1*1. 

Siam. A bird obtained at Bangkok by Bocourt was examined by 

me in the Paris Museum. It is evidently rather a young bird, the 

breast being still broadly streaked, the abdomen spotted; first pri


mary with two bars; bands on tail four, with distinct indications of 

a 
fifth. Total length 11*5 inches, wing 7*7, tail 5, tarsus 1*1. The 

wing is perhaps not quite perfect, as the bird has been in con


finement. 

Malacca. Birds from this locality are generally known as Ninox 

malaccensis (Eyton), which is most probably identical with the true 

N. scutulata of Sumatra. I have carefully compared the Malaccan 
examples to ascertain whether they are distinct from the Chinese 
and Japanese forms, or whether, like many other kinds of birds, they 
are only the northern form occurring in Malacca during migration. 
In the seven specimens before me five bands are apparent on the 
tail, one or two bearing distinct traces of a sixth basal bar; and 
although the general crushed-up formation of a Malacca skin gives 
them a smaller appearance, they will be found to be really only a 
little less in size. I am therefore unable to separate N. malaccensis 
from N. japonica.

In nearly all the above specimens the first primary is uniform ; 
only on one does there appear to be a trace of fulvous bars ; and as 
this specimen has a distinctly spotted abdomen, these two characters 
seem to be dependent on maturity. 
Camboja. The single skin that I have seen from this country was 
collected by the late M. Mouhot, and now belongs to the Norwich 
Museum. It measures as follows—total length 10*5 inches, wing 
7*8, tail 5*1, tarsus 1. In general appearance it is like the South-
China examples, and is adult, with a distinctly spotted abdomen; 
first primary mottled with fulvous near the base, but not distinctly 
barred. 
Borneo. 
A skin obtained by Mr. Wallace at Sarawak is in the 
M2 

104 BXTBONIDJ3. 

Museum, and it agrees best, at first sight, with the examples obtained 
in Hainan by Mr. Swinhoe. The bird is adult, having several 
distinct subterminal spots on the abdomon and bars on the first primary. 
Although the general colour is rather light brown, there is 
very little of a rufous shade even on the wings. Ears on tail four; 
but I can discover traces of a fifth basal one, now apparently nearly 
dissolved. Total length 11*5 inches, wing 8'5, tail 5, tarsus 1*1. 

The Norwich Museum contains a specimen from Borneo which is 
rather more rufous than the foregoing Sarawak bird. Bars on tail 
five, with faint traces of a sixth basal bar; first primary uniform ; 
streaks on under surface rather narrow, and several abdominal spots 
distinctly developed. 

In the Paris Museum I also examined a female specimen of a 
Bornean N'mox, purchased from the Maison Yerreaux. The abdominal 
spots were very large, and in general resembling the Labuan 
skins in the British Museum ; first primary with two or three faintly 
indicated bars; bands on tail four, with no trace of a fifth. Total 
length 10 inches, wing Sm5, tail 4*1, tarsus 0*95. 

The following is a description of Mr. Wallace's specimen:— 

Adult Above uniform deep chocolate-brown, wTith scarcely any 
variations at all on the upper surface, beyond a few nearly concealed 
white spots on the scapulars; wing-coverts uniform with the back, 
the small ones on the edge of the outer wing white, forming a spot; 
primary-coverts blackish ; quills dark brown, paler and more rufous 
on the outer edge, the innermost secondaries with a few half-concealed 
white spots and bars observable on disarranging the feathers ; 
upper tail-coverts uniform with the back; tail ashy brown, narrowly 
tipped with whitish and crossed with four broad blackish bands, the 
subterminal interspaces slightly broader than the others; facial 
aspect dusky and uniform w^h the? bead, scarcely any shade of burl 
or whitish being apparent on the forehead or lores; throat and 
chest equally obscure, being dark browm like the ear-coverts, the 
chin very scantily streaked with white, and the chest having a few 
white streaks where some of the plumes are margined with dull 
white ; rest of under surface rufous chocolate, varied with white, the 
bases and margins to the feathers being of the latter colour and the 
centres chocolate, varying in width and producing a more or less 
streaked appearance; under tail-coverts white, with brownish marks 
at the tips of a few of the feathers ; leg-feathers uniform deep chocolate 
; under wing-coverts nearly uniform deep chocolate, some of 
the inner plumes varied with deep oehraeeous bars, the lowest series 
nearly uniform sepia-brown, with a few oehraeeous spots near the 
base, resembling thus the inner lining of the wing, which is sepia-
brown barred on the inner web with pale brown, inclining gradually 
to oehraeeous towards the base of the inner web. Total length 10-8 
inches, wing 7*5, tail 4*4, tarsus 1*1. 

Labuan. Four specimens collected by Mr. Low are in the Museum, 
adults and slightly younger birds. They are all remarkable for 
their very dark coloi*ation, the scapular spots being very few and in 
one specimen entirely wanting. The head, sides of face, sides of 

11 . 3HN0X, 165 
neck and chest arc almost uniformly brown, together, so that the 
appearance of the fore part of the body is very dark. Two specimens 
I take to be adult and the other two rather younger, because of the 
more streaked character of the abdomen. All of them have the first 
primary perfectly plain ; and in the one I consider the youngest of 
the four there are no bars either on the first or second primary ; in 
the others there are faint traces of fulvous bars on the inner web of 
the second.

In the last three specimens there is a trace of even another basal 
bar to the tail. The Ninox of Labuan is quite as distinct as any of 
the other races, and if the dark coloration is constant will perhaps 
be found worthy of the title of N. hhuanensis. 

Flores. Mr. Wallace obtained a single male bird in this island 
in 1862. It is the type of his Athene jlorensis, but seems not 
different from Chinese examples. It is adult, with a plainly barred 
primary; bars on tail five; abdominal spots distinct; on the wing-
coverts a slight wash of rufous, one of them having a concealed ^hite 
spot. Total length 12*5 inches, wing 9-1, tail 5'5, tarsus 1*2. 

Mr. Swinhoe's Chefoo specimens match this bird, large as are its 
dimensions. The accompanying description has been prepared from 
the type:— 

Adult male. Above uniform chocolate-brown, the head not darker 
than the back, the uniformity only broken by a few broad white 
bars on the scapulars, these also being generally half-concealed; 
wing-coverts brown like the back, but very distinctly washed 
with clay-colour or ochraceous; primary-coverts blackish; quills 
dark brown, slightly washed with rufous on the outer edges and 
barred across with lighter brown, these light bars rather inclining to 
ochraceous on their outer edges, the inner secondaries barred with 
white on both webs, the bars showing when the plumage is disarranged; 
upper tail-coverts uniform chocolate-brown like the back; 
tail paler and more ashy brown, tipped with whitish and crossed with 
five blackish bands; ear-co\erts uniform with the head, but exhibiting-
slight remains of ochraceous shaft-streaks; forehead slightly white; 
lores whitish, obscured by blackish shaft-lines ; fore part of cheeks 
and throat buffy white, narrowly streaked with brown; rest of 
under surface whitish, becoming more fulvescent on the abdomen, 
the whole broadly streaked with chocolate-brown in the centre, inclining 
to rufous on the abdomen ; leg-feathers fulvous, mottled with 
small brown markings; under tail-coverts buffy white, the lower 
ones marked with oval spots of dark brown ; under wing-coverts 
dark chocolate-brown barred with ochraceous bufT, the edge of the 
wing whitish, the lower series sepia-brown like the wing-lining, 

166

and, like the inner lining of the quills, barred with fulvous. Total 
length 12-5 inches, wing 9*7, tail 5-8, tarsus 1*3. 

Having thus carefully examined a large number of these Owls, 
I believe that there are only three forms to be distinguished specifically—
two light and one dark. The light grey birds are peculiar to 
the Himalayas and the Andamans, the dark one ranges all over India 
(vide sujjm) and Ceylon, Malaisia, through China to Japan, and southwards 
into the islands of the Malayan subregion. The birds vary 
infinitely in size, even from the same locality, as will be seen by the 
following

Neither does the number of tail-bands help us at all, nor the 
barring of the quills ; for these characters are very variable, and 
perhaps depend on age. The result seems to be that, taking the 
Malaccan form (probably identical with the Sumatran) as the most 
typical, we find a great variation in size, the species gradually increasing 
to the northward, and reaching its maximum in Chinese 
and Japanese specimens. This larger bird seems to be migratory, 
if we may judge from the exact identity of iV. japonica with JV1 
florensis. The South-China bird is smaller than the Forth-China 
one; and the Nicobar bird is intermediate between these and N. 
hirsuta of Ceylon, which is the smallest and darkest of all.

on the abdomen and flanks, where the white spots are more oval in 
shape, producing an ocellated appearance; leg-feathers bright ochre, 
slightly streaked with brown on the outer aspect; under tail-coverts 
whitish, streaked and tipped with plain or ochraceous brown; under 
wing-coverts bright ochraceous, all streaked or barred with brown, 
the edge of the wing white, the lower series dark brown, barred with 
whitish on the inner web, exactly like the inner lining of the quills, 
which are dark brown below, with large rounded spots or bars of 
buffy white on the inner webs. Total length 14*5 inches, wing 9*8, 
tail 6-3, tarsus 1*75. 

Adult male (J¥. marmorata auct.). Above light brown, the head 
spotted all over with fulvous, the hind neck very thickly mottled 
with buffy white spots ; back uniform brown, the scapulars largely 
mottled with white, both webs of the latter, but especially the outer 
one, being largely barred with white ; wing-coverts brown like the 
back, the bend of the wing slightly washed with rufous, the greater 
and median series largely spotted with white on the outer web; 
primary-coverts dark brown, barred with lighter brown; wing-
coverts dark brown, slightly tipped with whitish, barred across with 
lighter and slightly rufous brown, some of the outer bars on the 
primaries fading off into a whitish notch externally; tail brown, 
barred with fulvous on the inner web, the centre feathers indistinctly 
marked with about six bars, confined, as on the other

feathers, to the inner web ; forehead and sides of head fulvous, with 

central brown streaks to the feathers ; lores whitish, with hair-like 

black shaft-lines ; ear-coverts brown; cheeks fulvous, narrowly 

streaked with brown; chin dull white; rest of under surface fulvous, 

the centres of the feathers pale brown, giving a broadly streaked 

appearance, the lateral margins to the feathers of the abdomen 

whiter, the central streaks indented with large white spots, causing 

the flanks to appear somewhat ocellated; leg-feathers ochraceous ; 

under wing-coverts whitish, mesially streaked with brown, widening 

out towards the tips of the feathers; under wing-coverts deep ochra


ceous, streaked with brown, especially near the outer edge of the 

wing, the greater series dark brown, barred with white like the 

inner lining of the quills, which are dark brown below, with broad 

buffy white bars on the inner web; cere bluish grey; bill horn


colour ; feet yellow; iris light brown in some, greenish brown (in


clining to yellow) in other examples. Total length 16 inches, wing 

10-3, tail 6-7, tarsus 1-75. 

Obs. After comparing our large series of specimens in the Museum, 
I have come to the conclusion that the Owl called Athene marmorata 
by Mr. Gould is only the adult of the large form of N. booboolc, which 
is more uniform when young, and becomes more spotted as it gets 
adult. This large N. booboolc appears to be an inhabitant of South 
Australia, and is replaced in the north and west by a smaller race 
or subspecies, which is generally more rufous in colour, having the 
head streaked with fulvous; the hind neck also appears never to 
become so spotted as in iV. booboolc,

Nestling. Clothed in whitish down, washed with golden buff on 
the head, neck, and breast; the feathers, as far as developed, resembling 
the plumage of the adult, but the white spots on the 
scapulars extremely large and of an oval shape on both webs; head

ochraceous, all the feathers centred and tipped with dark brown; 
lores and forehead whitish; ear-coverts entirely dark brown, contrasting 
strongly with the light-coloured head and neck; under 
surface of body whitish, with a few narrow central streaks of brown, 
rather broader on the chest, which is washed with golden buff. 

Adult. General colour above rather pale or earthy brown, the hind 
neck washed with fawn-colour; the head rather darker than tlio 
back, and slightly streaked with fulvous; scapulars brown like the 
back, broadly barred with white, occupying the greater part of the 
outer web, and showing very conspicuously; wing-coverts brown, 
the greater and median series with some distinct white oval spots; 
primary-coverts dark brown, with faint indications of lighter brown 
bars; quills dark brown, barred across with lighter brown, the 
primaries externally washed with pale rufous, the light bars fading 
into a buify white notch on the outer web of the outermost primaries 
; lower back and rump more rufous than the rest of the upper 
surface, the feathers having fawn-coloured bases; tail brown, the 
centre feathers uniform, the rest barred with fulvous on the inner 
web, these bars becoming gradually more* distinct towards the outer 
feather, the last one being barred with fulvous on the inner web, 
and spotted with the same on the outer one; lores and frontal plumes 
whitish, with black shaft-lines; sides of the head fulvous, narrowly 
streaked with brown, and forming a tolerably distinct eyebrow 
; ear-coverts dark brown, contrasting with the rest of the 
head; cheeks whitish, as also the feathers behind the ear-coverts, 
these latter streaked with brown; chin whitish; rest of under surface 
white, the breast yellowish, broadly streaked with rufous brown, 
the abdominal feathers almost entirely white, mesially streaked with 
brown and broadly tipped with pale fawn-colour; the under taileoverts 
whitish, narrowly margined with pale fawn-colour; leg-
feathers fawn-colour, whitish on the inner aspect; under wing-
coverts ochraceous fawn, with scarcely any indications of brown 
markings beyond an occasional streak near the outside margin of 
the wing, the greater series brown, irregularly barred with fulvous, 
resembling the inner lining of the wing, which is brown, with large 
bars of fulvous on the inner web; " bill slate-coloured, darker at 
tip ; iris dark brown " (Elsey, MB.). Total length 13*5 inches, wing 
8-6, tail 5-5, tarsus 1*65. 

Ohs. Although closely allied to K hooboole, this is a much smaller and 
more rufous species, and differs especially in its fawn-coloured under 
parts and under wing-coverts, the latter being uniform. In some of 
the browner-looking examples, there are some markings or stripes 
of brown upon these under wing-coverts, but never so thickly distributed 
as in the true iV. hoobooh The difference in size may best be 
estimated by a comparison of two males, the specimens described not 
having the sexes determined.

Adult female. Above deep chocolate-brown, the head darker but 
quite uniform brown, the forehead with a few ochraeeous streaks; 
round the hind neck an indistinct collar of bright ochre, more or less 
concealed spots of which are seen on nearly all the feathers; scapulars 
distinctly spotted with white, these spots being larger on the 
outer web; wing-coverts brown like the back, darker towards the 
edge of the wing, the greater series slightly washed with rufous, 
both these and the median coverts relieved by large rounded spots of 
white, smaller and less thickly distributed on the least ones; primary-
coverts uniform dark brown ; quills dark brown, banded with 
lighter brown, much paler near the base of the primaries, some of 
the lighter cross bands of these quills ending in a white notch; upper 
tail-coverts dark brown, many of them with a concealed ochraeeous 
bar near the base ,* tail dark brovfai, crossed with eight bands of 
lighter brown ; lores and a narrow eyebrow white, the former obscured 
by long hair-like bristles ; sides of face brown, the ear-coverts 
slightly streaked with whitish, the fore part of the cheeks more 
broadly; sides of the neck deep chocolate-brown, distinctly streaked 
with bright ochre ; under surface of body bright ochraeeous, all the 
feathers dark brown in the centre, producing a broadly streaked 
appearance, sometimes widening out and causing the ochraeeous 
colouring of the breast-feathers to assume the form of rounded spots, 
these markings being white on the lower breast and abdomen, producing 
a very distinctly mottled appearance, the flanks barred with 
brown and white; leg-feathers deep ochraeeous or rust-colour, almost 
chestnut, slightly shaded with brown on the outer aspect; under 
tail-coverts ochraeeous, with brown centres to the feathers; under

on the inner web, thus exactly resembling the inner lining of the 

quills, which are similarly coloured ; bill black, white on the ridge ; 

toes yellow, with dark hairs ; iris golden yellow. Total length 12*5 

inches, wing 7*5, tail 5*3, tarsus 1*35. 

Dr. Buller gives the female as slightly smaller than the male. 

The measurements for the latter are stated to be as follows—total 

length 12*5 inches, wing 8, tail 5-75, tarsus 1*5. The only spe


cimen in the British Museum sexed as " male " has the wings and 

tail too imperfect to admit of comparison.

smaller on the head and hind neck, larger and more in the form of 
bars on the scapulars, some of the white bars completely traversing 
these feathers near the base ; upper wing-coverts chocolate-brown, 
a little more rufous than the back, the least ones with a few fulvous 
spots, larger and whiter on the median and greater series ; primary-
coverts uniform sooty brown; quills brown, barred with paler brown 
fading off much lighter on the outer web of the primaries, some of 
which have a white notch or two towards the tip of the feather; 
upper tail-coverts uniform chocolate-brown; tail brown, indistinctly 
barred with paler brown, of which about six or seven are faintly indicated 
on the centre feathers ; forehead white; lores and a small

with large rounded spots of white, causing a somewhat ocellated 
appearance ; leg-feathers orange-tawny; under tail-coverts whitish, 
centred and mottled with tawny brown; under wing-coverts and 
axillarics dull tawny, waved with small markings of brown near the 
outer edge of the wing, the greater series ashy brown, spotted or 
barred with white, and thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, 
which are ashy brown, with large white spots or bars on the inner

length 13-5 inches, wing 8*9, tail 5-2, tarsus 1-5. 

Ohs. The Museum contains no specimens with their proper sexes 
attached ; but there is considerable difference in size among the 
specimens in the collection. A bird which I presume to be the 
male measures as follows—total length 12*3 inches, wing 8*1, tail 5, 
tarsus 1*4. 

Young birds appear to be less spotted with white above and to be 
rather darker in their general appearance.

06s. The above description is a translation of Count Salvador? s 
original diagnosis; and from a coloured sketch of the bird which he 
was so good as to send me, I have been able to place it in the synopsis 
of species; but I am not at all sure that it is a Nino®, the wing-
looking too short: the general appearance, in fact (judging from the 
sketch), is that of a gigantic Glaucidmm; and it is very probably 
the type of a new genus.

Adult. Above nearly uniform brown, the uniformity broken only 
by a few half-concealed white spots on the hind neck, the scapulars 
also barred with white, the markings on the outer wings much larger 
and diagonal in shape ; wing-coverts brown, a little paler than the 
back, the least series with a few ovate spots of white externally, 
larger and more in the form of a notch on the median and 
greater series; primary-coverts dark brown, barred with lighter 
brown; quills brown, barred across with paler brown, inclining to 
ochraceous and shading into a white notch on the outer web of the 
primaries, some of the secondaries also externally spotted with white; 
upper tail-coverts brown like the back, broadly barred with white, 
especially on the outer feathers, most of the spots concealed • tail 
brown, tipped with whitish and crossed with six other rather narrow 
bands of whity brown ; forehead and lores whitish, the latter with 
hair-like brown shafts ; ear-coverts light brown, slightly paler than 
the crown; cheeks whitish, the hinder part streaked with brown and 
merging into the sides of the neck, which is light brown, slightly 
streaked with white ; under surface of body dull white, everywhere 
broadly streaked with brown, these streaks broader and more dilated 
near the base on the breast-feathers; leg-feathers whitish, narrowly 
streaked with brown, the tibial plumes yellowish; under wing-
coverts white, streaked with brown exactly like the breast, the 
greater series ashy brown barred with white exactly in the same 
manner as the inner lining of the quills ; cere yellowish olive • bill 

light yellowish horn-colour; feet yellow, covered with fine hairs; 
iris bright yellow. Total length 21 inches, wing 12*5, tail 7*5, 
tarsus 2*1. 

The specimen above described, though not sexed, is doubtless a 
female, as a male bird obtained by Macgillivray during the ' Rattlesnake' 
voyage measures as follows—total length 19 inches, wing 
11*5, tail 7, tarsus 1*85. Mr. Elsey's two specimens, also sexed 
males, agree in the main with the above, measuring 11*3 and 11*7 
inches in the wing. They are much more rufous below than the 
other examples.

on the abdomen, but much less pronounced on the tinder tail-coverts; 
under wing-coverts bufty white, the outermost streaked with rufous 
brown. Total length ] 8 inches, culmen 1*7, wing 11*8, tail 7*8, 
tarsus 1/7. (Mus. Lugd.) 


A smaller bird, probably a male, measures—total length 15*5 
inches, wing 11, tarsus 1*65. (Mus. Lugd.) 


The type specimen, according to Mr. "Wallace (I <?.), measured in 
the flesh—total length 16*5 inches, wing 11*25, tail 6-5, tarsus 2. 
The difference in the length of tarsus probably arises from the greater 
facility of measuring this part when the bird is fresh; I make it in 
the skin 1*85 inch.

Adult female. Similar in colouring to the male. Total length 

12-5 inches, wing 9, tail 5-5, tarsus 1-4. 

Obs. The above sexes are determined by Mr. Wallace, in whose 
collection the specimens remained until they passed into the possession 
of the Museum. Another bird, also obtained by Mr. Wallace 
in Gilolo, differs in having the white bars on the scapulars very 
distinct and in having white bars on the greater wing-coverts. The 
hind neck shows slight indications of fulvous bars, the quills externally 
rufescent, with indications of fulvous spots on the outer web. 
Underneath the bird is much lighter than the ones described, being 
white, barred with rufous. As far as I ean judge, this bird is an old 
one and probably represents the fully adult stage. Another specimen 
from Batchian approaches it in having the under surface lighter 
and also a few indications of fulvous bars on the wing-coverts.

spots of white; "upper tail-coverts rufous, crossed witli a few obsolete 
bands of brown; tail dark brown, tipped with fulvous white and 
crossed with ten bars of rufous ; lores and feathers round the eye 
whitish, the former obscured by blackish bristles; sides of face and 
ear-coverts dull brown, streaked with buffy white; sides of neck 
rufous like the head, but mottled with white bases to the feathers; 
cheeks and chin pure white, the latter succeeded by a band of dark 
brown across the throat and followed by a large white fore neck ; 
rest of under surface white, streaked with dark brown, the sides of 
the breast rufous brown, mottled with whitish spots; sides of body 
ashy brown; thighs ochraceous, varied with small rufous brown 
bars ; tarsal plumes white, spotted with brown ; under wing-coverts 
yellowish white slightly streaked with brown, the greater series yellowish 
white at base, dark brown at tips, thus resembling the inner 
lining of the wing, which is ashy brown, barred with white and inclining 
to yellowish white near the base of the inner web; iris 
orange. Total length 8 inches, wing 3*85, tail 2-9, tarsus 0-9. 

Adult female. Eather larger than the male, shaded with ashy 
grey on the back and scapulars, this being probably only the sign of 
the adult bird and existing in both sexes; bars on tail eleven. 
Total length 8*6 inches, wing 4*4, tail 3*2, tarsus 0-95. 

Obs. The full-plum aged birds are much greyer on the back and

Adult female. Above umber-brown, with, a distinct ashy grey 
shade on the head, back, and scapulars; the whole of the upper 
parts varied with spots of yellowish white, inclining to small bars on 
the back, all the spots somewhat relieved by a continuous dark 
brown margin, but many of them concealed; occiput more plainly 
varied with fulvous white spots; the hind neck and wig strongly 
mottled with dull ochraceous spots, forming an indistinct collar; 
wing-coverts coloured like the back, washed like th.e scapulars with 
rufous brown, the fulvous white spots rather larger and the median 
coverts pure white, forming a large longitudinal patch of white on 
the upper part of the wing; quills dark brown, strongly washed with 
rufous brown from the base upwards, as also are the concealed 
greater coverts, all barred with lighter brown, inclining to white on 
outer web and producing a spotted appearance ; the secondaries more 
ashy grey like the back, barred with lighter brown, the white spots 
larger and forming small bars on the outer web, thus more resembling 
the back; rump uniform with back, the upper tail-coverts 
washed with rufous brown and varied with concealed bars of white; 
tail rufous brown, tipped and crossed with six narrow bars of white, 
on each margin of which the colour of the tail is a deeper brown ; 
lores and a distinct eyebrow whitish, the former varied with black 
hair-like bristles ; ear-coverts white, crossed with dark brown bars, 
rather minute in character ; cheeks and chin white; throat mottled 
with brown, which extends on to the sides of the neck, where it is 
somewhat washed with rufous; below the brown throat-patch the 
fore neck is conspicuously white, forming a sort of band; rest of 
under surface of body white, tinged with yellowish on abdomen and 
vent, the sides of the breast and flanks distinctly streaked with 
sepia-brown, the breast clouded and mottled with rufous brown, the 
centre only streaked and the sides of the uj>per breast entirely rufous 
brown, mottled with fulvous white spots; legs whitish, the upper

parts washed with yellowish brown, the tarsal plumes slightly 
marked with brown; under tail-coverts white, washed with brown 
at their tips; under wing-coverts yellowish white, those on the edge 
of the wing pure white, the centre ones longitudinally streaked with 
dark brown, the greater series whitish at base, ashy brown at tip, 
thus resembling the inner lining of the wing, which is ashy brown 
barred with white; bill yellow; feet brownish yellow, talons blackish 
brown; iris bright yellow. Total length 6*8 inches, wing 4*15, 
tail 2-8, tarsus 0*65. 

Adult male. Differs from the female only in being smaller. The 
statement made by some writers that the male has more of an ashy 
grey shade above than the female does not seem to me to hold good; 
for the bird before me is quite as grey as any old male. The bars 
on the tail are seven in number. Total length 6-2 inches, wing 3*85, 
tail 2*6, tarsus 0-6. 

Young male. Much browner than the adults and characterized by 
an absence of spots, the latter being apparently gradually assumed; 
the white wing-patch represented only by a few oval spots, and the 
bands on the quills and tail very narrow and dusky white; underneath 
the stripes on the flanks are very much broader.

Young. Above clear chocolate-brown, perfectly uniform on the 
interscapulary region, the scapulars distinctly marked with large 
rounded or oval spots of rufous ochre on their outer web; head grey, 
slightly tinged with brown and marked on the fore part of the crown 
with a few narrow ochraceous streaks; the hind neck mottled with 
white and forming a sort of collar, relieved by two blackish patches 
on each side of the neck and followed by a second indistinct 
rufous collar below the white one; wing-coverts rufous chocolate, 
varied with half-concealed small bars of rufous, the greater coverts 
deep brown with oval spots of rufous white; primary-coverts uniform 
deep brown, quills deep brown, sparsely spotted with rufous 
on the outer web, the secondaries browner like the back and externally 
margined and spotted with light rufous; upper tail-coverts 
rufous chocolate, indistinctly barred with light rufous; tail blackish 
brown, crossed with eight rows of white spots (counting the terminal 
one), these spots not continuous, but obscured by ochraceous and not 
meeting in the centre of the feather * lores and feathers round the 
eye white; ear-coverts greyish, washed with rufous and streaked 
with white; chin and cheeks white, extending in a distinct patch 
under the ear-coverts; throat pure white, separated from the chin

almost uniform, excepting a division of white feathers down the centre 
which are streaked with black; rest of under surface white, thickly-
streaked with black, the sides of the body rufous; leg-feathers 
ochraeeous brown, inclining to fulvous on the inner face; under wing-
coverts white, the innermost yellowish, with a patch of black near 
the outer margin, the greater series yellowish at base, blackish at 
tips, thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are greyish 
brown, plainly spotted with yellowish on the inner web, more largely 
near the base. 

Obs. Erom the uniform grey-headed plumage above described the 
present species moults into its second stage, as is evidenced by a 
specimen in Mr. H. S. Le Strange's collection. The crown in this 
bird is becoming dark brown like the back, the shafts indicated by 
rufous lines widening out in an oval form and crossed with other 
bars of rufous. This specimen also shows some mottlings on the 
back, thus approaching the Vancouver-Island specimen next to be 
described, and which I take to be in the second plumage. 

Adult male (in second plumage). Above brown with somewhat of 
a rufous olive tinge, the back varied with half-concealed arrow-
shaped spots of rufous ochre, larger on the scapulars and more oval 
in shape, inclining to white on the outer margin ; the hind neck also 
strongly mottled with rufous ochre, forming a kind of irregular collar, 
above which is a more clearly denned one of white, slightly varied 
with blackish and relieved by two patches of black on either side of 
the hind neck; head rather darker brown than the back, covered 
with minute spots of rufous ochre, larger and rather more elongated 
on the forehead; wing-coverts darker brown than the back and 
spotted in the same way with rufous ochre, taking the form of 
notches or bands on the greater series, some of the outermost of 
which are tipped with white, which forms a kind of longitudinal band 
down the wing; quills deep sepia-brown, indistinctly banded with 
blackish, externally spotted with rufous ochre, the secondaries 
browner, spotted and indistinctly barred across with ochraeeous buff; 
upper tail-coverts brown, longitudinally streaked near the base with 
white and spotted or barred near the tip with ochraeeous white; 
tail blackish with lighter brown bars inclining to white spots on 
either extremity, but larger always on the inner web, the tail thus 
appearing to have five bands without counting the terminal white 
spot on the inner web of each feather; lores and an indistinct eyebrow 
dusky white, the former obscured by blackish bristles; sides of 
face dark brown, minutely spotted with ochraeeous; chin and cheeks 
white, extending in a broad patch below the ear-coverts, crossed by 
a distinct band of brown, mottled with ochre and rufous and extending 
on to the sides of the neck ; fore neck conspicuously white ; rest 
of under surface pure white, narrowly but very distinctly streaked 
with black, disappearing on the under tail-coverts ; the sides of the 
upper breast mottled with ochraeeous spots, the flanks also varied 
with dark brown; leg-feathers white, slightly streaked with dark 
brown ; under wing-coverts white, streaked near outer margin with 
blackish, the greater series whitish at base, ashy brown at tip, thus

brown, dotted with dull white, some of the spots washed with rufous 
and inclining to small bars in some instances• round the hind neck 
the feathers marked with white, forming a kind of collar with the 
usual black patches on each side, succeeded by a second collar of 
rufous ochre, with which colour the feathers are marked in the form 
of bands ; wing-coverts a little browner than the back, with small 
transverse bars of pale rufous, the tips of the outermost median and 
greater wing-eoverts relieved by an ovate spot of white ; quills dark 
brown, with narrow whitish tips to the inner primaries and the 
secondaries, the quills indistinctly barred with greyish brown, 
changing to a white spot on the outer margin of the primaries and 
producing a chequered appearance, not so distinct on the secondaries, 
which are browner and have irregular transverse bars of white or 
ochraceous white; tail deep brown, crossed with seven rows of white 
spots, larger and more like notches on the concealed inner web; 
lores and feathers above the eye pure white, meeting over the base 
of the forehead, the former ending in black bristles; ear-coverts

white; chin and cheeks white, extending in a conspicuous patch 
under the ear-coverts ; lower throat pure white, separated from the 
chin by a band of dark brown feathers somewhat varied with rufous; 
rest of under surface white, distinctly streaked with black; the sides 
of the body ashy brown, spotted with white, these spots more distinct 
on the sides of the breast, which are washed with rufous; thighs 
white, mottled with brown on the outer webs ; under wing-coverts 
white, especially the bend of the wing, the inner ones and axillaries 
yellowish, with a few blackish marks a little way from the edge of 
the wing, the greater series yellowish at base, ashy brown at tip, 
thus resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are plainly 
barred with white on the inner web, less plainly and more spot-like 
on the outer, the secondaries barred on both webs with pale rufous. 
Total length 6 inches, wing 3*5, tail 2*7, tarsus 0-65. (Mus. H. S.

BKOWK PHASE. Adult. Above deep sepia- (almost blackish) brown, 
the head profusely marked with small rounded or minute triangular 
dots of fulvous white; the back uniform brown, with scarcely any 
concealed white dots; round the hind neck an indistinct collar of 
ochraceous buff, plentifully intermingled with black, with the usual 
two nape-patches of the latter colour; scapulars scarcely spotted at 
all, but exhibiting a few large white spots near their tips; wing-
coverts a little browner than back and nearly uniform, only the 
greater series with a few distinct white spots towards the tip of the 
feather; the primary-coverts uniform brown; quills dark brown, 
indistinctly barred with ashy brown, the bars being indicated on 
the outer web by a small white spot, inclining to bars on the secondaries 
; upper tail-coverts uniform with back, and indistinctly 
spotted with white ; tail blackish, crossed with six rows of yellowish 
spots; lores whitish, obscured somewhat by blackish shaft-stripes; 
white spots on side of crown rather larger, and forming a narrow 
eyebrow; sides of face brownish, with a few streaks and bars of 
dull fulvous; chin and cheeks white, separated from the white fore 
neck by a band of dark brown feathers, plentifully mottled with fulvous 
spots; rest of under surface white, broadly streaked with 
chocolate-brown, the white markings on the flanks rather larger 

and more oval; the sides of the body, and especially of the upper 
breast, more uniform chocolate-brown, with very distinct white 
spots, rather ovate in form; under tail-coverts white, with narrow 
streaks of dark brown; under wing-coverts yellowish, strongly 
mottled with dark brown round the bend and near the edge of the 
wing, the greater series yellowish at base, dark brown at tip, resembling 
more the inner lining of the wing, which is dark brown, 
with yellowish white bars on the inner webs of the quills; bill 
yellowish white; feet yellowish white; iris yellow. Total length 
6*5 inches, wing 3*9, tail 2-65, tarsus 0*75. 

RUFOUS PHASE. Adult, Above dusky ferruginous chestnut, the 
back and scapulars margined with more or less concealed spots of 
light ochraceous, the head with numerous narrow stripes of rufous 
ochre ; nuchal collar whitish, mottled more or less with black and 
relieved by the usual patches on each side of the hind neck, these 
being more indistinct than in some of the allied species, the upper 
back mottled with large ovate spots of yellowish ochre below the 
nuchal collars; scapulars coloured like the back and spotted in the 
same manner and exhibiting very distinct oval spots of white on 
their outer margin; upper wing-coverts also uniform with the back 
and minutely spotted with lighter rufous, the greater series having 
large terminal spots of white like the scapulars; primary-coverts 

204 BTTBOJNTDJS. 

brown, with a few rufous spots; quills dark brown, barred across 
witk light rufous, these lighter bars terminating externally in a 
fulvescont spot; tail rufous brown, crossed with eight distinct bars 
of light rufous, sometimes but not always completely traversing the 
feather and here and there inclining to whitish; lores whitish at 
base, terminating in yellowish bristly hairs; sides of face rufous 
brown, narrowly streaked with buffy white; chin and fore part of 
cheeks whitish, separated from the fore neck, which is also white, by 
a broad band of rufous on which slight ochraceous mottlings appear; 
rest of under surface white, blotched with broad stripes of bright 
rufous, the sides of the body almost uniformly of this colour, the 
sides of the breast distinctly marked with oval spots of ochraceous 
white; under wing-coverts* whitish, marked with brown near the 
bend and edge of the wing, the greater series yellowish at base, brown 
at tip, resembling the inner lining of the wing, which is brown barred 
with yellowish white on the inner webs of the quills, these bars 

inclining to pale rufous near the ends of the quills. Total length 
6-5 inches, wings 4*1, tail 2'55, tarsus 0-75. 

Another rufous specimen has a more uniform npper surface with 
less distinct stripes on the head, which is obscurely spotted with 
paler rufous; the tail rufous, barred with dusky brown, eight bars 
being perceptible on the centre feathers, but these irregular in shape 
and more or less connected together by a longitudinal mark along 
the shaft; these bars more or less obliterated on the other feathers, 
which exhibit the centre part for the most part dusky brown, from 
which branch on either side irregular and ill-defined bars of the same 
colour. 

Another specimen in the Museum represents what I believe to be 
the young bird of the rufous phase. It is of a deeper and more 
maroon-chestnut colour, and is nearly uniform everywhere on the 
upper surface; the crown is dusky rufous brown, with only a few 
narrow fulvous stripes on the forehead; the tail uniform deep 
rufous, with the faintest indications of obsolete bars near the tips 
of some of the feathers. 

Obs. The Trinidad form of G. ferox, which I keep separate from 
the Central-American and Brazilian forms, holds an intermediate 
position between the two latter, not being exactly similar to either 
and partaking partially of the characters of both. The brown phase 
is considerably darker than the corresponding plumage of either 

G. feroco or G. ridgwayi, and is more of a chocolate-brown; the spots 
on the tail are six in number and smaller than in Brazilian birds. 
The rufous plumage is also much darker and more chestnut than in 
either of the two allied birds, and is separated by its distinctly spotted 
back from the corresponding stage of G. ridgwayi, though resembling 
the latter in the characters of its tail when adult. Until, therefore, 
we know more of the species of Glaucidium from Venezuela 
and Trinidad, it seems better to keep this as an intermediate and at 
present geographically isolated form.

base, dark brown at tip, resembling the inner lining of the quills, 
which are dark brown with yellowish bars on the inner web. Total 
length 6 inches, wing 3-6, tail 2-7, tarsus 0-8. 

Less adult (? female). Browner in all respects than the foregoing 
description, the head being partly streaked and partly spotted with 
dull white or pale rufous; tail rufous, crossed with nine bands of 
brown of about equal width with the rufous interspaces. These 
tail-bands are sometimes eight and sometimes nine in number, and

BKOWJ?" PHASE. Young. Above reddish brown, the head more 
earthy brown, but the whole of the upper surface almost entirely 
uniform, excepting a few concealed rufous ochre spots on the inter-
scapulary region, changing to fulvous bars on the outer scapulars ; 
round the hind neck an indistinct collar of ochraceous buff, with 
some of the feathers whitish, nearly all of them tipped with black, 
which is more distinct on the sides of the hind neck; wing-coverts 
rather darker than the back, minutely spotted with rufous ochre, the 
greater series plainly spotted and barred with ochraceous buff; 
quills blackish, barred across with the same reddish brown as the 
back, paler and more ochraceous on the inner web and exhibiting 
paler spots of the same on the outer secondaries, whitish on the 
primaries; tail black, crossed with five (one concealed) rows 
of rounded white spots, without including the one at the tip of the 
inner web ; lores and a distinct eyebrow whitish, the latter washed 
with ochre, the former obscured by blackish bristles in front of the 
eye ; ear-coverts brown, with narrow whitish shaft-lines and barred 

208 BTTBONID^E. 

with pale ochre ; chin white, extending in a large white patch below 
the ear-coverts on to the sides of the neck; across the lower throat 
a bar of plain dark brown extending on to the sides of the neck and 
followed by a large white patch on the fore neck,• rest of under 
surface of body ochraceous, the centre of the abdomen white, the 
under tail-coverts brownish at tip; the lower surface of the body 
broadly but irregularly streaked with dull reddish brown, the sides 
of the upper breast and the flanks uniform, reddish brown ; under 
wing-coverts deep ochre, with a longitudinal patch of dark brown 
near the outer edge of the wing, which is whitish round the bend, 
the greater series yellowish white at base, blackish at tip, thus resembling 
the inner lining of the wing, which is blackish, barred with 
lighter brown towards the tip, inclining to yellowish white near the 
base. 

Adult. Above dark brown, with a slight tinge of reddish on the 
back, which is varied with more or less concealed bars of deep ochre, 
each bar having a conterminous line of black above and below, the 
outer scapulars and greater wing-coverts relieved with large spots of 
ochre or white; head more greyish brown, contrasting with the 
back and covered with numerous rounded or elongated spots of 
ochraceous white, extending on to the sides of the neck, which are 
coloured like the head ; round the hind neck a whitish collar, here 
and there varied with deep ochre and black, a large patch of the 
latter being visible on each side of the hind neck; wings coloured 
as in foregoing young specimen, excepting that the rufous bands are 
more distinct and the external white spots are larger; tail black, 
with five distinct rows of white spots (not including the terminal 
spot on the inner web), the two centre feathers with a subterminal 
spot of white on either web; facial features and under surface of 
body much as in foregoing description, excepting that the stripes on 
the lower parts are more distinct and the sides of the breast are 
minutely spotted with ochraceous white like the head; under wing-
coverts and bars on inner lining of wing whiter and not so rich ochre 
as in the young bird. Total length 6 inches, wing 4*15, tail 2*75, 
tarsus 0*7. 

BTJFOUS PHASE. Adult. Above rufous brown, the head mottled 
with rufous chestnut, which takes the form of broad shaft-streaks, 
widening out here and there into large spots or lateral bars ; round 
the hind neck encircled with an indistinct collar of rufous ochre, 
somewhat varied with white spots and having the usual black neck-
patches well defined; back rufous brown, thickly mottled and barred 
across with rufous, most of the feathers with distinct transverse 
bars ; wing-coverts dark brown, barred with rufous ; quills blackish 
brown, barred with lighter and more rufous brown, changing to clear 
rufous on the outer web of the primaries and thus producing a chequered 
appearance, the inner secondaries regularly barred with 
rufous and black; tail bright rufons, with indications of seven black 
cross bands, irregular in shape and sometimes connected by a mesial 
streak along the shaft; feathers round the eye, forming an indistinct 
eyebrow, rich ochre; the lores whiter, and terminating in black 

13 . GLAUCIDIUM. 
bristles; ear-coverts bright rufous, streaked with narrow white 
shaft-lines ; chin and cheeks white, extending in a patch backwards 
under the ear- coverts; lower throat pure white, separated from the 
chin by a band of rufous; remainder of under surface rich ochre, with 
the exception of a few white feathers near the centre of the body; 
the sides of the upper breast rufous brown, mottled and barred with 
rufous, like the back; the sides of the body also bright rufous, 
the flanks mottled with patches and bars of dark brown and slightly 
streaked here and there with the same colour; leg-feathers bright 
ochre, minutely barred with brown; under wing-coverts very deep 
ochre, as also the edge of the wing, a short distance from which are 
several blackish spots, the greater series ochraceous at base, ashy 
black at tip, thus resembling the inner lining of the wing, which 
is blackish, broadly barred with rufous on the inner web, inclining 
to deep ochre near the base of the inner web. Total length 6 inches, 
wing 3-9, tail 2-55. 

Young. Differs from the adult in being more uniform on the back 
and in not showing the bars which produce the mottled back in the 
latter; the bands on the quills and tail are not perfect, but the dark 
brown colour occupies the greater part of the inner webs of the 
secondaries, extending on to the outer one in a few dusky blackish 
notches; the tail uniform rufous, with a few indistinct blackish 
markings, principally longitudinal and close to the shaft of the 
feather. (New Granada: Mas. Salvin and Godman.) 

Obs. Another young bird in the Museum, obtained by Goering 
in the Sierra Nevada, Yenezuela, is, in some respects, different 
from the one above noticed; for it has the transverse bars on the 
secondaries complete, and the tail as strongly barred with black, 
though as irregularly, as in the adult; but the rest of the upper surface 
is dull rufous chocolate, almost uniform, with the exception of 
a few narrow and indistinct rufous shaft-lines on the crown; underneath 
the bird is ochraceous, with no white, but streaked with 
rufous on the lower parts, the sides of the upper breast and flanks 

being rufous mottled with brown.

Adult male. Above ashy brown, on the back spotted with white, 
more or less concealed, the more conspicuous spots relieved by a 
small conterminous black mark; scapulars with a large white patch 
on their outer webs, forming a conspicuous longitudinal mark on 
each side of the back; head and nape rather more ochraceous brown 
than the back, the forehead spotted, but the crown and wig barred 
with white, each bar having a conterminous one of black; hind 
neck silvery white, mottled with black near the bases of the feathers, 
forming a kind of irregular collar, which is succeeded by another 
one of orange-buff, which obscures the white spotting on the 
feathers; wing-coverts coloured like the back, but slightly washed 
with ochraceous, largely spotted with white on the median and 
greater series; quills dark brown, the primaries inclining to ashy 
at their tips, the secondaries narrowly tipped with white, all the 
quills barred across with light rufous brown, changing to white on 
the outer web, and thus producing a spotted appearance, the bars 
becoming fulvous white on the inner web and banding the innermost 
secondaries with white; tail-feathers dark brown, washed with 
rufous, tipped on the inner web with white, and conspicuously 
spotted with white on both webs, the spots on the inner one larger 
and more oval and six in number; loral plumes, feathers above 
and below the eye, as well as the sides of the face white, the ear-
coverts obsoletely marked with blackish; chin white; rest of under 
surface white, the throat marked with ochraceous brown, the breast 
almost entirely of the latter colour on the sides, but mottled with 
more or less concealed spots and bars of white; the belly, flanks, and 
sides of body thickly streaked with dark brown, the centre of the 
body white ; leg-feathers white, slightly mottled with dark brown ; 
under tail-coverts white, excepting a slight mark of dark brown 

13 . GLAtfCIDITJM. 
near the tips of the middle ones; under wing-coverts ochraceous 
buff, here and there marked with dark brown, the greater series 
dark brown at tip, thus resembling the lining of the quills, which 
have the inner web ochraceous near the base; small coverts round 
the bend of the wing white; bill yellow ; iris yellow. Total length 
7 inches, wing 4-15, tail 3*2, tarsus 0*95. 

• Adult female. Similar to the male. Total length 8 inches, wing 
4*4, tail 3*2, tarsus 1. 
Young. Nothing is as yet precisely known regarding the young 
plumage of this Owl; but I fancy tbat the more spotted birds are 
the oldest, although it is almost impossible to say, as in some specimens 
the spots and bars are about equally distributed. 

Two Abyssinian specimens, collected by Captain Sturt during the 
British expedition, have more of an orange-buff shade on the head 
than those from Southern Africa, and they appear to have about 
one row of spots more on the tail. At present, however, my material 
is not extensive enough to separate them specifically. The 
Oambian specimen agrees best with the Abyssinian.

Ohs. The type of Mr. Gould's Athene minutilla is now before me, 
and I am fain to confess that it seems to me to be only the male of 
the ordinary G. brodlei. It is a young bird, with nearly uniform 
upper surface, and measures as follows—total length 5-8 inches, 
wing 34 , tail 24 , tarsus 0*75. The Museum contains other specimens 
of this small bird, evidently the same species, and exhibiting 
both rufous and grey phases. The following are the measurements

Glaucidium pardalotum. Sharpe, Ibis, 1875, p. 259. 
Adult Head umber-brown, thickly dotted with ochraceous spots 
on the fore part of the crown, the hind part and the nape with 
ochraceous bars• round the hind neck a tolerably distinct collar of 
clear ochraceous feathers barred with black, the latter colour being 
very distinct on the sides of the hind neck; rest of the upper surface 
ochraceous brown, everywhere distinctly barred with bright 
ochraceous, most of these bars with a conterminous black margin; 
upper tail-coverts spotted with ochraceous; tail blackish brown, 
tipped with ochraceous and crossed with six other bars of the 
same colour; scapulars brown like the back, distinctly barred 
across with bright ochraceous, the outermost white for apical half, 
with a terminal bar of black; quills dark brown, barred with ochraceous 
and slightly washed with the same colour, the bars very 
much broader on the greater series; quills blackish, the primaries 
with a few tiny spots of ochraceous, the secondaries narrowly tipped 
with ochraceous, the spots on the outer web larger than on the 
primaries; lores and a small eyebrow white, the shafts of the former 
produced into long hair-like bristles ; sides of face blackish brown, 
spotted with ochraceous* chin and cheeks white, the latter forming 
a large triangular patch on the sides of the neck, and separated 
from the white fore neck by a band of dark brown feathers 
spotted with light ochraceous; centre of the body pure white, the 
belly streaked with light brown, the sides of the body ochraceous 
brown, the sides of the upper breast barred with light ochraceous; 
leg-feathers dark brown ; under tail-coverts white, with a few narrow 
brown streaks; under wing-coverts white, the inner ones washed 
with yellow; a few brown spots near the outer edge of the wing, 
the greater series yellowish at base, ashy brown at tip, like lining of 
the quills, which are ashy brown, barred on the inner web with yellowish 
white. Total length 6 inches, wing 3*45, tail 2-5, tarsus 0*75. 
(Mus. E. Swinhoe.) 
Obs. This species is extremely close to G. brodiei, and is said by 
Mr. Swinhoe to differ from that bird by having the belly spotted with 

13. GLAUcimmr. 
215 

black. It certainly does not show so much white below and is more 

spotted; but the characters are very slight; the bars on the scapu


lars are rather more sagittate.

ashy brown than the back, spotted and barred with dull white; 
the sides of the face like the head, but the lores and feathers behind 
the eye white, the hinder neck encircled with a not very distinct 
collar of ochraceous buff; throat and sides of neck pure white, as also 
the chest and the entire centre of the body, the lower part of the 
throat and sides of the breast rufous brown, the flank-feathers somewhat 
margined with white, producing a striped appearance; under

Total length 6-5 inches, culmen about 0-65, wing 3*8, tail 2-1, 
tarsus 0*8, middle toe 0-7. (Mus. Lugd.) 

Hab. Sumatra. 

Obs. The note that I made at the time of examining the type 
was that it was " closely allied to G. brodiei, but differing in its 
rufous brown back, dusky sides of face, and especially in the uniform 
chestnut sides of the body."

Glaucidium castanonotum, Sharpe, Ibis, 1875, p. 259. 
Adult Upper surface deep rufous chestnut, with remains of blackish 
cross bars more or less visible on the back and greater wing-
coverts, some of the outer median coverts slightly notched with fulvous, 
all the rest uniform chestnut like the back; primary-coverts 
dull brown, with a few rufous bands externally; primaries dull brown, 
barred with rufous brown on the inner web, the outer web having a 

216 BUBONID^E, 

corresponding spot of rufous, inclining to fulvous on the outermost 
primaries; secondaries also dark brown, banded with rufous on the 
outer and with fulvous on the inner web, these bands much less 
distinct on the inner secondaries; npper tail-coverts blackish brown, 
narrowly banded with fulvous, exactly resembling the tail, which has 
eight narrow fulvous bands including the terminal one ; entire head 
and neck dark brown, everywhere narrowly banded with ochraceous, 
the, hind neck banded and spotted with white; ear-coverts rather 
darker than the head, but barred in exactly the same manner ; lores 
brown, barred with ochraceous, the bases being white; cheeks pure 
white, forming a triangular patch; chin whitish; throat crossed 
with a band of dark brown feathers, barred with ochraceous like the 
sides of the neck, with which it is continuous ; sides of the breast 
blackish brown, narrowly barred with ochraceous; the rest of the 
under suiface of the body white, streaked down the centre with 
brown, with which colour the flanks are also barred; under tail-
coverts whitish; leg-feathers fulvous, barred with brown; under 
wing-coverts whitish, with a few brown spots near the outer edge of 
the wing, the greater series whitish at base, brown at tip; inner 
lining of the wing dull and slightly rufous brown, spotted on the 
outer and barred on the inner web with pale rufous, inclining to fulvous 
on the latter; bill yellow; feet greenish brown. Total length 
8*7 inches, wing 5-5, tail 2*7, tarsus 0*9. 

Qbs. The specimen presented to the Museum by Mr. Gould is not 
in very good order, but shows that the amount of cross barring on 
the back varies; for whereas in the subject of our description the 
back is nearly uniform, in the other bird the blackish cross bars can 
be traced very plainly all over the upper suiface.

tawny feathers, narrowly barred with black; rest of under surface 
of body white, the sides of the body thickly barred with black, these 
becoming more distinct on the flanks; the upper breast rufous or 
fulvescent, barred with black, and resembling the sides of the nock ,* 
leg-feathers white, tinged with rufous on the thighs, which have a 
few remains of blackish bars; under tail-coverts buffy white; under

Ohs. "Whether G. malabaricum be specifically distinct from G. radiatum 
will be a matter for Indian ornithologists to decide; but the 
general appearance of Malabar birds is very different from those of 
Northern India. The rufous head and wings, and the greater breadth 
of the white bars on the tail, are very conspicuous in the southern 
form. Mr. Hume (Bough Notes, ii. p. 411) notices certain differences 
between these little Owls from Northern and Southern India, 
but does not consider the difference to be specific; the Museum also 
contains both grey and rufescent birds from the Himalayas, but none

Adult. Above brown, the feathers all slightly tipped and distinctly 
barred across with ochraceous, the bars on the hind neck wider and 
here and there inclining to white spots, forming an indistinct kind 
of collar ; scapulars externally white, showing a broad longitudinal 
shoulder-patch; wing-coverts marked exactly like the back, but 
the bars rather more rufous ochre, the outer median and greater 
coverts with large and distinct spots of white; primary-coverts dark 
brown ; quills dark brown, tipped with whitish, the primaries obsoletely 
barred on the inner web with lighter brown, and notched on 
the outer one with fulvous, more or less inclining to rufous; the 
secondaries barred with fulvous on the inner web, the bars nearly 
traversing the innermost secondaries ; upper tail-coverts darker 

brown than the back, barred with ochraceous, the lower ones with 
white; tail-feathers blackish brown, narrowly tipped with whitish 
and crossed with six other bands of white ; lores and an indistinct 
eyebrow dull white, the former obscured with blackish shaft-lines ; 
ear-coverts fulvous, barred with blackish; cheeks white, forming a 
triangular patch on the sides of the neck; chin and fore neck 
whitish, separated from each other by a tolerably broad band of 
dark brown feathers, somewhat mottled with ochraceous bars; the 
sides of the upper part of the breast brown, distinctly barred across 
with ochraceous, these bars dissolving into lateral spots on the lower 
sides of breast; rest of under surface of body white, very broadly 
streaked with brown, the flanks barred with ochraceous buff, but 
less distinctly than the breast; under tail-coverts white; leg-feathers 
fulvous, with dusky brown cross bars; under wing-coverts yellowish, 
inclining to white near the edge of the wing, the greater series yellowish 
at base, brown at tip, the wing-lining being dark brown, 
barred with yellowish near the base of the inner web and inclining 
more to rufous. Total length 11 inches, wing 6-2, tail 3-8, tarsus 1. 

Obs. None of the Museum specimens are sexed, and I therefore 
cannot define the relative size of the sexes. Specimens vary much 
in colouring, some being very much darker than others. 

Young. In general similar to the adults, but having the upper 
surface much more spotted, none of the bars being so distinct, and 
the whole appearance of the upper surface more rufous; on the hind 
neck a few whitish triangular spots; patch of white on scapulars 
absent; wing-coverts with distinct whitish external marks, but these 
somewhat washed with ochraceous; underneath more dingy and obscured 
than the adult, the bars on the sides of the breast very faintly 
indicated.

Obs. The specimen from "Moalmaza" is thus marked by Mr. 

G. E. Gray; at present I have not found this name in an atlas. 
He calls it "Athene cuculoides, var.;" but I cannot see that it 
is different from the ordinary species. It is more rufous underneath, 
and has the stripes on the abdomen broken up into bars; 
but I find this appearance on some of the Nepal examples, though 
scarcely to the same extent. The head is uniformly coloured with 
the back. I was at one time inclined to separate the Siamese bird 
as distinct on account of its grey head and orange-striped under 
surface. The Museum contains a specimen collected by the late 
M. Mouhot in Siam, of which I append an exact description; but I 
can scarcely believe it to be a species, as I saw specimens in the 
Paris Museum, obtained by M. Bocourt in Siam, which seemed to 
me inseparable from Himalayan examples. 
Adult Upper surface brown, everywhere crossed with narrow 
ochraceous bars, inclining to whitish on the hind neck, scapulars, 
and upper tail-coverts, the bars on the latter rather broader; outer 
web of scapulars pure white, forming a narrow longitudinal shoulder-
patch ; wing-coverts more rufous brown than the back, barred across 
with rufous ochre, the median series externally white, forming a 
broad but imperfect wing-bar; primary-coverts brown, with obsolete 
rufous cross bars; quills dark brown, barred with rufous on the 
inner web, these bars being represented on the outer web by a 
large fulvescent notch; the secondaries completely barred across with 
rufous, inclining to fulvous on the outer web, the bars on the innermost 
secondaries rather narrower; tail brown, slightly washed with 
rufous, and crossed with seven bands of white, nowhere very broad, 
and tinged with fulvous near the base; head and neck much greyer 
than the rest of the back, everywhere barred across with whitish, 
more broadly just behind the ear and on the sides of the neck; 
lores dusky, the shafts white near the base; ear-coverts dull brown, 
barred across with buffy white ; cheeks white, forming a triangular 
patch; chin whitish, separated from the fore neck, which is also 
white, by a band across the throat, consisting of brown feathers 
barred with fulvous like the adjoining sides of the neck ; the sides 

of the upper breast dark brown, barred with bufTy white, the brown 
bars gradually becoming light rufous towards the lower breast; rest 
of under surface white, broadly streaked with pale rufous, the flanks 
barred with dusky brown and pale rufuus ; under tail-coverts white ; 
leg-feathers fulvous white, slightly spotted with brown, the plumes 
at the bend of the tarsus light rufous, slightly marked with brown 
spots; under wing-coverts white, the innermost and the auxiliaries 
yellowish, the greater ones washed with rufous and tipped with ashy 
brown, appearing as if part of the lining of the quills, which are

the bars on the hind neck rather whiter, especially towards 
the base of the feathers; wing-coverts brown, the bars deeper ochraceous 
and wider apart than on the back; the outer scapulars with 
large white spots externally, forming a distinct shoulder-patch, the 
outer and median wing-coverts also with very large white terminal 
spots, forming a longitudinal band down the wing; primary-coverts 
dark brown, slightly tipped with whitish, and crossed with a few 
nearly obsolete bars of lighter brown; quills dark brown, tipped 
with white and crossed with bars of lighter brown, these bars represented 
on the outer web by fulvous or fulvous brown notches, these 
notches widening into bars on the secondaries, extending right across 
the innermost of them* tail blaekiiJi, broadly tipped with white, 
and crossed, moreover, with live other bands of white • lores and a 
tolerably distinct eyebrow white, the former obscured by central 
shaft-streaks of black; ear-coverts barred with ochraceous and black * 
cheeks white, extending backwards and forming a triangular white 
patch behind the ear-coverts; throat pure white, as also the fore 
neck, these being separated from each other by a band of ochraceous 
feathers barred with brown, extended on both sides and joining the 
sides of the neck, which are similarly barred; sides of breast broadly 
barred with ochraceous and dark brown * rest of under surface white, 
the abdomen broadly streaked with rather pale brown, the flanks 
thickly mottled with brown bars ; thighs for the most part white, 
washed with fulvous on the upper part, and barred externally with 
brown ; under tail-coverts white, with a few narrow brown shaft-
streaks near the tips of the feathers ; under wing-coverts and edge 
of wing white, the inner ones washed with yellowish, the lower 
series yellowish at base, ashy brown at tip, thus resembling the 
inner lining of the quills, which are ashy brown below, broadly 
barred with yellowish on the inner web, much more distinctly on the 
secondaries. Total length 11*5 inches, wing 6*4, tail 4*3, tarsus 1*25. 

Adult female. Rather browner than the male, and not so closely 
mottled with ochraceous bars • bands on tail six, not including the 
terminal one. Total length 12 inches, wing 6*3, tail 4*5, tarsus 1-3. 

Obs. Both the Eokien birds in the collection have five bars on the 
tail besides the terminal one; they are, however, much more rufous 
than the specimens described, all the cross bars of the upper surface 

13 . GIAUCIDTUM.

being rufous, and in general appearance they look much more like 
Indian specimens of G. ntculoides. G. wJiitelii, however, is always 
larger than the latter, and never has more than six bars on the tail, 
instead of seven as in the Himalayan species.

Above umber-brown (less pure and uniform than in Glaucidium), 
ench feather with an irregular transversely elliptical spot of pale 
ruibus, these largest on the forehead bordering the white eyebrows; 
the feathers everywhere minutely mottled transversely with darker, 
this being most noticeable where bordering: the yellowish spots. 
Scapulars with their outer webs almost wholly white. Wings with, 
the ground-colour a little darker than the back; lesser coverts with 
numerous spots of light rufous, there being two on each feather, one 
concealed; middle and secondary coverts with a very large oval 
spot of pure white terminating the outer webs, the white spot on 
the latter preceded by a pale rufous one; secondaries with five 
(exposed) bands of pale ochraceous (the last terminal), these passing 
into white on the edge ; primary-coverts with three large ochraceous 
spots; primaries with about six (including the terminal) conspicuous 
spots of the same, those anterior to the emargination on the third, 
fourth, and fifth quills almost white; tail like the wings, but more 
uniform, crossed by six irregular narrow bands of pale ochraceous, 
the last or terminal of which is not well defined; these do not touch 
the shaft, and on the inner webs they are pure white; lores and 
eyebrows, cheeks, lining of the wings, and ground-colour of the 
lower parts white; ear-coverts and suborbital space like the crown, 
but more rusty; lateral lower parts much washed with plumbeous, 
this especially prevalent on the flanks; behind the sharply defined 
white of the cheeks is a black transverse wash; throat, jugulum, 
breast, and abdomen with each feather having a median longitudinal 
ragged-edged blotch of pale rufous, these blotches most clearly defined 
on the abdomen, more confused anteriorly; anal region and 
tibiae almost immaculate; tibiae with numerous transverse narrow 
blackish bars on a pale ochraceous ground; lining of the wing faintly 
spotted at the bend and on the primary-coverts, the terminal half 
of which is plain dusky; under surface of primaries blackish, with 
obscure transverse paler spots, those anterior to the emargination 
almost white, those beyond darker, the last being scarcely distinguishable, 
on the longest quill eight can be detected; bill pale 
greenish; iris yellow. Length " 6-25 " inches, extent " 15-25," 
wing 440, tail 2*30, culmen 0-35, tarsus 0*80, middle toe 0-60.

A male from Socorro Island (Colonel A. J. Gra3rson) is less adult 
than the preceding. The upper plumage is more brownish and 
more mottled; the rufous spots, though deeper and larger, are less 
sharply defined; the spots on the primaries are all ochraceous; the 
bands on the tail are broader though of the same number. Beneath 
the longitudinal blotches do not appear; but the rusty rufous covers 
nearly the whole surface, leaving the median portion only white, and 
this not well defined; the rusty shows ragged minute transverse bars 
of blackish. The whitish collar round the nape is also better defined 
than in the type. Total length 5*20 inches, wing 4*20, tail 2*10. 

Another specimen, from the same locality, also apparently immature, 
is just like the preceding in plumage. It measures—wing 4 
inches, tail 1*90. (Id. I. c.)

Adult. General colour above golden buff, everywhere more or less 
obscured with blackish, the centre of the feathers being entirely of 
the latter colour and producing a longitudinally striped appearance, 
the plumes having lateral vermiculations and wavy bars of blackish, 
so that the back has rather an obscure appearance; scapulars less 
vermiculated externally, so that they appear to have oval patches of 
golden buff on the outer web; wing-coverts golden buff, vermiculated 
with dark brown, the latter colour predominating on the outermost 
coverts ; the primary-coverts almost entirely blackish brown, 
with bars of lighter brown obscured by darker vermiculations; quills 
ashy brown, with very distinct cross bands of darker brown, breaking 
up into vermiculations on the secondaries, all the interspaces being 
more or less obscured by frecklings of dark brown; the primaries 
lighter than the secondaries, and inclining to pale orange-buff towards 
their external base; upper tail-coverts brownish, slightly mottled 
with golden buff; tail dull fulvous, with seven tolerably broad bands 
of darker brown, narrower and more indistinct towards the apex, 
the inner webs banded with narrower bars of dark brown, about ten 
in number, the bases of the tail-feathers paler and more distinctly 
golden buff; crown of head and neck deeper golden than the back, 
the central streaks of black rather narrower and the vermiculations 
more scanty, being generally represented by thread-like bars branch

Professor Schlegel says this is a large form of A. mexieamts. He does not 
unite it to the latter bird; and I therefore think it better to keep it distinct, at 
least for the present. The following are his measurements taken frcm the type 
in Berlin—total length 
18 inches, wing 11*6, tail 5*9.

ing from the central streak; ear-tufts two inches long, dark brown, 
narrowly margined with golden buff on the external and broadly on 
the inner web; forehead rufous, with dark brown centres, eyebrow 
white and the lores white, the latter with black bristles; ear-coverts 
dull chestnut, some of the feathers whitish; round the face a disk 
of blackish brown feathers, with which the hinder margins of the 
ear-coverts coalesce, and behind the dark ruff appears another less 
characterized one of bright orange; chin whitish; the throat-feathers 
stiff, rufous with dark brown shaft-stripes; rest of under surface 
bright orange-buff, with broad dark brown centres, narrower on the 
abdomen and absent on the under tail-coverts; leg-feathers yellowish 
white• under wing-coverts whitish, somewhat tinged with buff and 
having a few brown spots near the outer margin, the greater series 
whitish at base, dark brown at tip, resembling the inner lining of 
the wing, which is ashy brown, barred with darker brown and inclining 
to yellowish buff near the base of the feathers. Total length 
13*5 inches, wing 10*9, tail 6*5, tarsus 2*3. 

Obs. The specimen described is a dark example with a chestnut 
face, which is also exhibited in a Bahian specimen. In other respects, 
however, the latter differs in being everywhere more rufous, 
the cencral stripes to the feathers of the upper surface being by no 
means so distinct, while the vermiculations are more generally dispersed 
over the upper surface; the eyebrow and lores are pure 
white, contrasting with the chestnut face. 

Two other examples, the one from Brazil the other from Bogota, 
are much more mealy in general appearance, and are much whiter 
underneath, with very little tinge of orange-buff or yellow; and 
consequently the black streaks stand out in bold relief. Above the 
general aspect is lighter, the scapulars having large external patches 
of white, as also the greater wing-coverts. The tail-bands, eight 
in number, are more broken up, and mingle with the vermiculations 
of the interspaces.

Nestling. Covered with down of a yellowish buff colour, the plumes 
of a dull brown colour, with oehraceous or whitish buff tips, the 
quills largely spotted and barred with ochre, all the feathers round 
the eye and on the sides of the face uniform dark brown; frontal 
plumes light buff. 
Fully grown young. Above more or less uniform brown, somewhat 
streaked by reason of the oehraceous buff margins to most of the 
feathers, all of which have concealed oval spots of ochre, nearly all 
these, however, being invisible; head and hind neck much more 
distinctly streaked, the centres being dark brown, the margins 
broadly oehraceous; wing-coverts coloured like the back, but varied 
with larger spots of ochre, which occupies the base of most of the 
feathers, the greater series with large ovate spots of white on the 
outer web, the outer scapulars also similarly marked, but the oehraceous 
markings much indented by brown mottlings; primarycoveits 
uniform dark brown; quills brown, whitish at tip, and 
barred with huffish orange, the primaries entirely of the latter colour 
for two thirds of their length, and broadly barred with dark brown ; 
the secondaries irregularly mottled with spots and barrings of light 
ochre, the margins to these quills being also of this colour; all the 
quill-feathers when spread light ochre on the inner web, narrowly 
barred with brown; upper tail-coverts nearly all orange-buff, with 
brownish margins and tips; tail dark brown, shading into whitish 
at tip, and crossed with about six bars of whitish ochre on the 
centre feathers, these bars not continuous and the interspaces 
mottled with brown, the outer feathers richer oehraceous, the brown 
bars much narrower and about six in number, disappearing towards 
the base of the tail; ear-tufts 0*85 inch long, brown, with narrow 
margins of ochre; ruff brown, speckled with oehraceous, the plumes 
above the eye whitish buff, with brown central streaks to the 
feathers; facial plumes white, the lores and most of the feathers 
with hair-like black shafts, especially round the eye, the feathers 
surrounding which are entirely black; under surface of body light 
buff or oehraceous straw-colour, inclining to whitish on the abdomen 
and under tail-coverts, the latter, as well as the leg-feathers, being 
quite uniform excepting a few linear brown shaft-stripes ; the breast 

236 BUBONIDJE. 

clouded with, dark brown centres to the feathers, rather narrower 
on the lower breast, abdomen, and flanks, these having a distinctly 
striped appearance; under wing-coverts light ochraceous buff, with 
a few narrow brown shaft-streaks, the lower series dark brown, with 
ochraceous base, forming a bar across the inner side of the wing. 

Adult male. General colour above pale ochraceous buff, deeper on 
the centre of the back, the centres of the feathers longitudinally 
dark brown, producing a broadly streaked appearance, the scapulars 
much paler on their outer margins, the brown markings more 
irregular and branching into bars, so that the interspaces represent 
large ovate spots of whitish buff; wing-coverts rather darker than 
the back and more of a reddish ochre, the central markings to the 
feathers dark brown as on the back, but more irregular and forming 
bars, on the median and greater series more confined to the inner 
web, the outer ones having very large and distinct ovate whitish 
spots, which are very conspicuous on the wing; primary-coverts 
dark brown, with a few rufous ochre spots, principally near the 
base; quills rufous ochre, with a whitish tip, inclining also to fulvous 
near the base of the outer primaries, all the feathers very 
plainly chequered with dark brown bars, which are much narrower 
on the inner webs; upper tail-coverts nearly uniform ochraceous, 
shaded slightly with brown near the tips; tail-feathers ochraceous, 
tipped with whitish and crossed with seven brown continuous bars 
on the centre feathers, only five in number on the outer ones, where 
the bars are much narrower and disappear near the base; frontal 
plumes dark brown, narrowly margined with ochraceous ; ruff 
whitish, slightly washed with ochre, and minutely speckled with 
triangular spots of brown; facial aspect dull white, the lores shaded 
with brown, the ear-coverts with narrow blackish shaft-lines, all 
the feathers round the eye black• ear-tufts 0*5 inch long, resembling 
the feathers of the crown ; chin whitish; the ruff below, extending 
upwards behind the ear-coverts, ochraceous, mottled with dark brown 
centres to the feathers; rest of under surface buffy white, washed 
with golden buff on the breast and sides, the breast-feathers streaked 
with brown down the centre, these streaks narrowing into linear 
shaft-lines on the lower breast and abdomen, and disappearing 
entirely on the legs and under tail-coverts; under wing-coverts 
white, very faintly tinged with ochre, the outer greater coverts 
blackish, forming the characteristic spot, the rest of the wing-lining 
whitish; the secondaries with obsolete brownish bars, which are 
nearly absent on the primaries, these being blackish on tips and 
only slightly barred with ochraceous, the outer feathers having a 
blackish mark about halfway up. Total length 14 inches, wing 
12-4, tail 6*5, tarsus 1-75. 

Adidt female. Of the same general appearance and markings as 
the male, but always much deeper in colour, the under surface being 
of a rich ochre; bands on tail sis on the middle and four or five 
on the outer feathers. Total length 15*5 inches, wing 12*5, tail 6*7, 
tarsus 1-85. 

Obs. From the examination of a large series of Short-eared Owls, 

15 . ASIO. 
i>37 
I believe that the change from the young or darker plumage is accomplished 
more by the gradual dissolution of the brown markings 
on the feathers than by a direct moult; this change affects the tail 
also, the bars narrowing by reason of the dissolution of the brown 
colour, remains of which are always more or less apparent on the 
interspaces. Another tolerably good indication of an adult bird 
can also be found in the amount of brown on -the inner side of the 
wing, the younger birds having the end of the wing clouded with 
brown without transverse bars, and showing also a distinct spot or 
bar of brown about halfway down on the outer primary. This bar 
is absent in an adult bird, and the end of the feather has buffcoloured 
bars on the inner, spots on the outer web. Another difference 
in the adult bird is the attenuation of the shaft-stripes on 
the breast-feathers, which become narrower with age; and these 
narrow breast-markings are generally contemporary with the disappearance 
of the wing-spot above mentioned; but this is not always 
the case, for, as in other birds of prey, the exact sequence in the 
change of the parts seems to vary in individuals. 

Hah. The temperate and tropical regions of both hemispheres, 
extending far into the Arctic circle: absent in West Africa, Australia, 
and Oceania, but present in the Sandwich Islands.

Ohs. The excellent series of Short-eared Owls enumerated above 
enables me to speak with some certainty concerning the various 
races which have been raised to specific distinction by various ornithologists. 
In the foregoing list of the specimens in the national 
collection I have arranged them under four headings, each form thus 

* One of these specimens is labelled "galapagoensis" by Dr. Kaup; but it is by 
no means a yery dark-coloured one. 
15 . ASIO. 239 
classified having slight peculiarities, but none of thera possessing 
sufficient characters to allow of their being specifically separated. 
All over Europe and Asia there is but one type, according to my 
observations; but in America the general run of the specimens is 
rather darker and more ochraceous : hence the Short-eared Owl of 
the New World has been called A. cassini. I have seen specimens 
from different parts of America which 1 could not separate in the 
least from European examples; and in comparing specimens from 
the Old and New "World care must be taken that birds of the same 
sex are examined, as the females of both are always more rufous 
than the males ; thus if a female of the American. Short-eared Owl 
were compared with a male of the European kind, the impression 
would be that the former was more rufous, and vice versa. I have 
seen, however, birds of both sexes from British Columbia and from 
Chili which were absolutely similar to British-killed specimens. 

In the Falkland Islands the Short-eared Owls seem permanently 
rufescent, but cannot be distinguished from some Chilian skins; and 
as some of the latter agree perfectly with European examples, no 
line for specific separation can be drawn: I must say, however, that 
at present I have never seen a light-coloured bird from the Ealklands. 


The Owl from the Galapagos is by far the most different of any, 
by reason of its small size, dark coloration, golden forehead, and 
striped thigh-feathers. I have never seen a specimen from any 
other locality exhibiting the latter character; at the same time a 
Bogota skin in every other respect approaches it in appearance; and 
therefore, although I admit that at present it would appear to be 
specifically distinct, I should like to be sure that the New-Granadan 
Short-eared Owl would not form a connecting-link. 

The specimens from the Sandwich Islands form an interesting pair 
on account of their locality; but they cannot be separated as a species. 
They are rather small, and have a very dusky frontal patch: 
this I have found in other Asiatie specimens; and therefore the 
Sandwich-Island Owl can only be considered a small race of A. «ccipitrinus.

interspaces and the terminal white margins both broader than on the 
dorsal feathers; primary-coverts dark brown, banded with lighter 
and more reddish brown, inclining near the base to golden buff; 
quill-feathers, as far as developed, dark brown, inclining to greyish 
at their tips, barred with ochraceous or reddish brown, inclining to

Adult female (grey phase), General colour above ashy grey, the 
dorsal feathers slightly washed with rufous, and most of them streaked 
down the centre with dark brown, with lateral zigzag lines of the 
same, the interspaces between the latter being often white, this arrangement 
giving a generally vermiculated appearance to the upper 
aspect of the bird; the outer scapulars more coarsely vermiculated, 
and having a large oval spot of pure white externally; wing-coverts 
more rufescent than the back, the least ones reddish brown, centred 
and vermiculated with dark brown, the median and greater series 
rather greyer, more coarsely lined, barred with white externally, and

to white towards the base; the secondaries regularly barred 
with light ochraceous brown and dark brown, the interspaces being 
mottled all over with the latter colour, all the feathers tipped with 
white; the inner secondaries greyer and more like the back, mesially 
streaked with dark brown and vermiculated with the same, the dark 
brown bars complete only on the inner web, and entirely broken'up 
on the innermost quills ; tail ashy rufous, tipped with whitish and 
varied with dark brown zigzag markings, the outer feathers broadly 
barred with dark brown, though most of the bars are more or less 
dissolved;'crown of head dark brown, the feathers notched on both

1G . SYKNTTTM. 249 

rest of the upper surface, the centres of the feathers only being 
brown with lateral margins of the same colour, causing a somewhat 
streaked appearance; facial aspect whitish, the plumes in front of 
the eye pure white, the lores terminating in blackish bristles; ear-
coverts slightly mottled with a few cross markings of brown; facial 
ruff blackish brown, the feathers" tipped with silvery white, the 
plumes of the upper part also notched with the latter colour; chin 
rufous, with black streaks down the centre of the feathers; the ruff 
below the chin whitish, the feathers also having a broad mesial streak 
of brown; fore neck white; rest of under surface white, broadly 

streaked with blackish brown down the centre of the feathers, the 
breast-feathers having also some zizgag lateral bars of brown, the 
central streaks also not continuous to the base of the plumes, and 
much paler on the abdomen and under tail-coverts; leg-feathers 
white, spotted and minutely barred with brown; under wing-coverts 
and margin of wing white, streaked with dark brown, the lower

the outer with yellowish white, the secondaries barred right across; 
bill whitish horn-colour; claws horny white at base, darker towards 
the tip; iris blue-black. Total length 19 inches, wing 12*1, tail 8,

wing 12, tail 9, tarsus 2-1. 

Adult male (rufous phase). Total length 18*5 inches, wing 11*1, 
tail 7, tarsus 1-95. 

Foot of Syrmum aluco, to show extent of feathering on toes. 

Obs. The rufous and grey plumages of the Tawny Owl are not 
dependent upon age or sex ; but the idea has been entertained by some 
ornithologists that the rufous birds were the young and the grey 
ones the old. As a rule, the nestlings have all red tails; but the Museum 
possesses a young bird still with remains of down on it, but 
yet entirely in the grey phase of plumage.

Adult, General colour above dusky greyish brown, everywhere 
mottled with white in the form of zigzag bars and markings, the 
white on the outer web of the scapulars more distinct, but not forming 
a very distinct shoulder-patch; wing-coverts exactly like the back, 
and marked with white in the same way; primary-coverts dark brown, 
barred across with lighter brown; primaries dark brown, barred 
with lighter brown, these pale bars inclining slightly to whitish 
on the outer webs, the innermost secondaries deep brown, mottled 
with white in the same manner as the back; tail-feathers brown, 
darker towards the tip, crossed with about eight feebly indicated 
greyish white bands, all of which are plentifully mottled with 
brown; head and neck greyish brown, mottled with numerous white 
bars, not very distinct or continuous; face dusky cinereous, indistinctly 
banded with dark brown, the feathers immediately over the 
eye black; lores and an indistinct eyebrow whitish; ruff chocolate-
brown, very slightly spotted with buffy white, the light markings 
more distinct on the lower parts of the ruff, particularly on the feathers 
adjoining the sides of the neck; chin whitish, the ruff-feathers 
immediately below being brown, with rather broad whitish margins, 
some of them buffy white, narrowly barred with brown; rest of 
under surface greyish brown, mottled with dull white, generally in 
the form of rather broad bars ; the leg-feathers very dingy brown, 
mottled with whitish; sides of body and under wing-coverts rather 
whiter than the rest of the under surface and more distinctly banded 
with brown; the lower series of the greater under wing-coverts 
brown, barred with yellowish white, thus resembling the inner lining 
of the wing; bill yellow; iris yellow. Total length 30 inches, wing 
19, tail 13-5, tarsus 2-35. 

Ohs. As in the case of the Long-eared Owl, the American and 
European birds are not exactly alike, but yet approach each other 
so closely that it is difficult to give exact specific characters. The 
American bird in the present instance is altogether darker than $. 
Icvpponicum both above and below, the central brown streaks to the 
feathers of the breast being much less distinct in S. timreurn. 
The best character that I have seen as yet for distinguishing the two 
is by lifting the wing, when the European species immediately discloses 
a distinct white patch at the base of the primaries, which is 
absent, or at least scarcely discernible, in the American birds. This 
is caused by the much broader character of the white bars at the 
base of the primaries in JS. lapponicum—these existing, it is true, in 

S. cinereum, but much less distinctly and generally clouded over and 
obscured by greyish-brown mottlings.

Adult female. General colour above dull white, streaked with dark 
brown, all the feathers being brown in the centre with broad lateral 
margins of white; the scapulars purer white externally, the central 
brown streaks narrower, so that these plumes stand out in relief 
against the dorsal feathers; wing-coverts rather browner than the 


BTTB0NID2E. 

2m 

back, the whitish margins not so broad, the greater series doll brown, 
barred with lighter brown, inclining to white at the tips; quills brown, 
tipped with whitish and broadly banded across with lighter brown, 
these bands being paler and more ashy white on the outer webs, 
especially of the primaries, where the external white markings are 
very large and give a chequered appearance to the outer aspect of the 
wing; upper tail-coverts pale brown, mottled all over with irregular 
spots and bars of ashy white; tail-feathers dull brown, and crossed 
with six broad bands of ashy brown, the last sub terminal and preceding 
a whitish tip to all the feathers; frontal plumes dark brown 
and not distinctly streaked like the hind neck and back ; facial aspect 
dusky white, with a few indistinct dark brown streaks on the 
ear-coverts, the loral plumes with black shaft-lines; facial ruff very 
distinct and complete, white, with brown bases and central streaks 
branching out into small bars near the apex of the plumes, and thus 
producing somewhat of a mottled appearance on the lower portion of 
the ruff, the brown being entirely confined to a central streak ; rest 
of under surface whitish, some of the feathers washed with yellow, 

and all of them very broadly streaked down the centre with, dull 
brown, blacker on the flanks and abdomen; leg-feathers uniformly 
whitish; under wing-coverts white, streaked with brown at a little 
distance from the outer edge of the wing, the greater series dark 
brown, whitish at base, resembling the inner lining of the wings, 
which are dark brown, broadly barred with yellowish or yellowish 
white on the inner web. Total length 27*5 inches, wing 15*7, tail 
12-5, tarsus 2-3. 

Obs. A specimen from the TJssuri River, collected by Br. Dybowski 
and now in the Museum, differs from the European birds examined 
by me in being a much darker bird everywhere, the brown predominating 
and the white margins not so broad, the scapulars, secondaries, 
and upper tail-coverts inclining to clear ashy grey on the 
margins * sides of the neck and facial ruff purplish brown, the latter 
mottled and spotted with white ; under surface of body much more 
broadly streaked than in the European specimens. It measures as 
follows—total length 24*5 inches, wing 14*3, tail 11*5, tarsus 2-2. 
The feathers of the foot seem to me to be thicker and longer than in 
the Swedish and Styrian birds in the Museum * and the Japanese 
specimen also seems to me to be equally thickly clothed as regards 
the feet.

Adult. General colour above brown, the head rather darker than 
the back, the entire upper surface barred across with broad bands of 
yellowish buff, rather whiter on the hind neck and wig, and decidedly 
white on the back, where the markings are less distinctly in the 
form of bars, being often confined to white notches on each side of 
the feather; wing-coverts brown, the least series with minute yellowish 
or white spots, the median and greater series more largely 
spotted with white, the latter being also faintly barred across with 
lighter brown; primary-coverts dark brown, barred across with yellowish 
brown; quills dark brown, barred with lighter brown, the

Mr. Kidgway separates a race from Mirador, Mexico, as Syrnium nebuloszcm,

white ; face without any darker concentric rings." He describes the race fully 
as follows (N.-Am. B. iii. p. 29):—" In general appearance like S. nebuloszcm, 
but the brown very much darker and less reddish, that of the markings below 
very nearly black: the pattern, however, precisely the same; and there is about

Adult. Above reddish chocolate-brown, with more or less concealed 
bands of yellowish ochre, sometimes inclining to white, the 
scapulars more largely marked with ochre on the outer web; wing-
coverts rather darker chocolate than the back, the least series with 
only a few indistinct reddish bars, the outer ones with a few white 
spots, the greater and median series barred across with yellowish, 
inclining to white on the outer web; primary-coverts dark brown, 
with a few reddish bars ; quills dark brown, slightly margined with 
whitish at the tip, and barred across with dull rufous, the lighter 
bars inclining to white on the margins of the quills, the spots much 
larger on the primaries, producing a chequered appearance; upper 
tail-coverts chocolate-brown, barred with yellowish buff; tail chocolate-

other rather narrow bands of ochraceous, the centre bars inclining to 
whitish ; frontal feathers chocolate-brown; the head, hind neck, and 
wig bright golden ochraceous, all the feathers tipped with chocolate-
brown, producing a distinctly barred appearance, the plumes on the 
side of the neck having a whitish shaft-stripe; facial aspect dull 
white, the feathers round the eye blackish, as also the loral plumes ; 
the ear-coverts with mesial white shaft-lines and faint rufous bars ; 
facial ruff dark chocolate-brown, the upper and lower portion more 
fulvous, the feathers being barred with the latter colour; chin dark 
brown; the ruff below the chin whitish, with broad dark central 
streaks ; rest of under surface yellowish, the breast barred with chocolate-
brown, the flanks and sides of the body streaked broadly down 

the same proportion between the light and dark bars as is seen in S. nebulosum. 
The face is plain dirty white, without the brown bars or semicircles—a constant 
and conspicuous feature in 8. nebulosum. There is the same number of 
spots on the primaries and bands on the tail as in the latter; the white beneath 
is without any ochraceous tinge; the primary-coverts are plain dark brown.

Adult. Above of a rufous chocolate-brown, the head deeper brown, 
all the upper surface barred with white, these bars being generally 
in the form of two spots, each of which has a narrow margin of 
black, the white bars on the outer scapulars much broader, thus 
forming a distinct shoulder-patch; the wig distinctly barred with 
white, but the back more spotted; least wing-coverts uniform chocolate-
brown, the rest coloured like the back, and spotted with 
white in the same fashion, the greater series with irregular oral 
markings of white, two or three in number on the outer web, these 
feathers slightly vermiculated with brown towards their tips; quills 
light rufous chocolate, darker at their tips, barred across with light 
brown on the outer and with dark brown on the inner webs, the 
light bars terminating externally in a more or less distinct spot of 
whitish; the secondaries much paler and more uniform with the 
back, the white external spots very distinct, and the innermost 
barred with white exactly like the back; all the quills tipped with 
white, and the spots on their outer webs generally vermiculated 
slightly with brown; upper tail-coverts of the same colour as the 
back, and barred across with white; tail dull rufous chocolate, inclining 
to brown on the outer feathers, all the reetrices dull whitish 
at tip and crossed with seven bands of fulvous brown, inclining to 
whitish towards the external margins, the bars on the inner webs 
much broader and bright ochraceous in colour; all the sides of the 
face dull ochraceous; the ruff chocolate-brown, narrowly barred 
with white near the tip, and with ochraceous towards the base, 
the feathers being entirely ochraceous at the extreme base; the ruff-
feathers encircling the throat chocolate-brown, narrowly barred 
with ochraceous; chin fulvescent; rest of under surface of body 
white, barred across with deep brown, these bars becoming narrower 
on the abdomen and under tail-coverts, and gradually disappearing 
into zigzag markings, on the leg-feathers; on all the under surface 
a shade of golden buff is apparent in places, the breast being of this 
colour, transversely barred with white and dark brown; under 
wing-coverts white, very narrowly barred with brown in the form 
of zigzag lines, the outer feathers rather more broadly barred in this 
way and washed with golden buff; the greater series fulvous at

base, ashy brown at tip, thus resembling the inner lining of the 
wing, which is ashy brown, fulvous at the base of the feathers, 
which are also barred with the same colour on the inner webs. 
Total length 22-5 inches, wing 15-6, tail 9, tarsus 2-3. 

m Obs. A Penang specimen from Mr. Wallace's collection has the 
wing 14-3 inches, and is probably the male; but a Cochin-Chinese 
example measured only 13-3 inches; so that perhaps the bird from 
the latter country runs smaller. I can see no other differences.

appearing on the breast fawn-colour, barred with, white; quills dark 
brown, shaded with rufous on the outer web and crossed with several 
bands of paler brown, which are margined above and below by a 
narrow blackish line. 

Adult Above deep chocolate-brown, the head blackish and 
decidedly darker than the back, the upper surface showing a few 
diamond-shaped spots or bars of white; the crown spotted, but the 
wig distinctly barred with the latter colour, most of the dorsal plumes 
having concealed fulvous bars; least wing-coverts blackish chocolate;

and ornamented withlarge bars of white externally, as on the scapulars; 
primary-coverts blackish brown, slightly washed with reddish brown; 
quills dark brown, washed at the extreme tip with ashy brown, the 
primaries banded across with paler brown, producing a chequered 
appearance on the outer web, where the light bars shade off into a 
white spot; the secondaries paler brown, more numerously barred 
with light brown than the primaries, the innermost being barred with 
white ; tail dark brown, the centre feathers having four bands of 
paler brown, not counting the pale rufous-brown tip, the exterior

fulvous bars on the inner web, brighter on the secondaries. Total 
length 15 inches, wing 10, tail 6-5, tarsus 1-9. 

05$. This species replaces in Western Africa the S. woodfordi of 
South Africa. It is altogether darker above than that species, the 
head being blackish, and it further differs in the uniform character of 
the back and least wing-coverts, which are without vermiculations. 
No specimen which I have seen as yet of & woodfordi had the broad 
white bands on the secondaries; while below the prevailing aspect of 
the last-named species is buff or whitish, banded with pale rufous, 
in $. nuchale it is rich rufous with distinct white cross bands. 
The title was originally suggested by the white bands on the nape 
appearing much more distinct than in #, woodfordi, where their 
small size and the general pale colour of the bird renders them not 
very conspicuous.

Nestling. Covered with down of a dull white colour, the sprouting 
feathers brown, banded with dingy ochraceous and broadly tipped 
with whitish buff; the under feathers coloured in the same manner, 
the breast-feathers especially brown.

fulvous and tipped with white, giving the head a hoary appearance; 
wing-coverts brown, slightly vermiculated with lighter brown and 
ochraceous, and broadly tipped with white ; quills and tail-feathers 
as in adult, but the bars rather narrower on the latter; under surface 
of body light ochraceous, inclining to whitish on the belly, 
everywhere transversely barred with light brown. 

Full-grown young bird. Above dark chocolate-brown, the hind 
neck with a few cross lines of ochraceous buff, the dorsal feathers 
with a few vermiculations of ochraceous, not disturbing, however, 
the general brown appearance of the upper surface; head darker 
brown than the back, scantily marked with a tiny white streak in 
the centre of the feather, these markings larger and more star-
shaped on the hind neck and wig, and present, though in a smaller 
degree, on most of the dorsal feathers; scapulars externally pale 
orange-buff, shading into white subterminally, and forming a distinct 
longitudinal shoulder-patch; wing-coverts chocolate-brown, a little 
darker than the back, with a few nearly obsolete cross markings of 
fulvous, here and there relieved with a narrow black line, the median 
and greater series being the palest of all, on these alone the 
star-shaped median spot being apparent as on the back, the greater 
coverts having a distinct spot of ochraceous white on the outer web; 
primary-coverts almost entirely brown, with obsolete bars of lighter 
brown near the tip; quills brown, with a terminal edging of fulvous

or five bands of ochraceous brown; rump and upper tail-coverts 
coloured like the back, but barred rather plainly with ochraceous 
buff; tail dark brown, with a pale whitish tip, and crossed with 
seven pale brown bands, inclining to ochraceous near the base, these 
including the subterminal light brown bar, the bands on the inner 
web broader and paler ochraceous; lores and feathers over the fore 
part of eye white, all those round the eye dark brown; the ear-
coverts whitish, obscured with narrow brown bars; feathers of the 
ruff brown, minutely banded with ochraceous, the bars much broader 
on the gular portion of the ruff; chin whitish ; rest of under surface 
of body ochraceous buff, with broad bands of fawn-brown and 
white, most of these bands having a conterminous line of blackish 
brown above and below; leg-feathers fulvous, with a few narrow 
zigzag lines of brown; under tail-coverts fulvous, very narrowly 
barred with brown; under wing-coverts deep ochraceous, with a 
few narrow streaks of dark brown near the outer margin of the 
wing, the outer coverts of the lower series dark brown at tip, thus 
resembling the inner lining of the wing, which is dark brown, with 
ochraceous bands on the inner web, especially of the secondaries. 

Adult. Above chocolate-brown, regularly banded across with dull 
fulvous, these bars dilating in the centre into a diamond-shaped 
spot, indistinct on the dorsal feathers, more plainly developed on the 
scapulars, and very distinct on the head, hind neck, and wig, where 
the bars are broader and whiter; crown of the head rather darker 
than the back, and the bars somewhat smaller; scapulars externally 
white, narrowly barred with brown, forming a conspicuous longitudinal 
shoulder-patch; wing-coverts brown like the back, but rather 
more uniform, the greater and median series with narrow fulvous 
bars and vermiculations, and scantily marked with diamond-shaped 
spots of white like the back; quills brown, fulvous at tip, and 
distinctly banded with ochraceous brown, inclining to white on the* 
outer web, the secondaries barred with ochraceous brown and fulvous 
much more narrowly than the primaries; upper tail-coverts brown 
like the back, but distinctly barred with white ; tail brown, tipped 
with whitish, and crossed with six bands of paler brown, not counting 
the pale subterminal shade of brown which precedes the whitish 
tip, but which can scarcely be called a band; facial aspect dull 
brown, with narrow fulvous shaft-streaks, and circularly barred 
with dusky whitish; lores and feathers over the eye more distinctly 
white, with blackish shaft-stripes and a few narrow bars of brown; 
ruff composed of brown feathers, slightly barred with whitish, the 
plumes on the lower portion yellowish white, with narrow brown 
bars; chin dull white, barred across with brown; rest of under 
surface white, barred narrowly with brown in regular transverse 
bands, and varied with rufescent tips to the feathers, the white bars 
always the broadest and most distinct; leg-feathers fulvous, with 
narrow zigzag bars of brown; under tail-coverts white, with nar

row brown cross bars; under wing-coverts fulvous, thickly barred 
across with brown, the outermost more broadly barred, the greater 
series fulvous at base, dark brown at tip, thus resembling the inner 
lining of the wing, which is dark brown, barred on the inner web 
with pale ochraceous, the secondaries more distinctly barred with 
the latter colour; bill, cere, and feet light yellow; iris varying 
from light brown to yellow. Total length 15-5 inches, wing 9*5,

* Like 8. zonocercum, the name of 8. polygrammicum was published by the 
late Mr. G*. K». Gray in the second catalogue of Accipitres (1848). No type 
specimen was indicated, no description given, and at least three species were 
included under this MS. name, viz. 8. mrgatum (Cass.), 8.mperciliare, Pelz., and 
8, suinda (Y.). Either of the last two species would justify the specific name of 
polygrammicum; and it is only by hazard that I can refer to the mounted 
example of 8. superciliare as being the 8.jpotygrammicum of the 'Hand-list,' for 
no indication is on the stands of the specimens. Seeing, therefore, that it is impossible 
tofix the type of Gray's species (which was, in addition, never described), 
it appears to me safer to recognize Von Pelzeln's name, which was accompanied 
by a full description of the bird.

coverts coloured and barred in the same manner as the back, but 
the brown bars rather broader; primary-coverts dark brown, barred 
with dull ochraceous brown; quills dark brown, barred with very 
pale ochraceous brown, lighter on the outer web, where about nine 
can be counted on the primaries and seven on the secondaries, not 
including the light tip; tail brown, tipped with pale brown, crossed 
with seven bands of the same colour, the bars decidedly ochraceous 
near the base; loral feathers and those on fore part of forehead conspicuously 
white; lores white at base, black at tip; ear-coverts 
rufous, fringed with black, the shafts to the feathers white; facial 
ruff orange-buff, slightly barred with brown, the lower part of the 
ruff yellowish white below the ear-coverts, forming a conspicuous 
crescentic mark; entire under surface of body yellowish ochre, 
washed with deeper ochre on the sides of the upper breast and 
mottled with chocolate-brown in the form of irregular bars on the 

chest, and of longitudinal streaks on the flanks and abdomen, which 
are also sparsely mottled with zigzag brown markings; the under tail-
coverts with scarcely any remains of bars; leg-feathers pale ochraceous 
buff; under wing-coverts rich ochraceous, the greater series 
ashy brown, barred with yellowish white near the base, and thus 
resembling the inner lining of the wing, which is also ashy brown, 
banded with lighter brown, changing to yellowish white near the 
base. Total length 17 inches, culmen 1-6, wing 10*8, tail 6*7, 
tarsus 1*85. {Brazil.) 

Obs. Mr. Wallace collected a specimen at Para, which, with some 
hesitation, I refer to this species. Unlike the one described, it has 
a black tail with only five bars (not counting the white terminal one), 
and the streaks on the belly are brown, without the lateral mottlings 
apparent on the other specimen. The barred character of the upper 
surface and the facial features, however, being the same in both, I 
cannot but believe the other differences to be the result of age.

region and more distinct on the crown, rump, and upper tail-coverts, 
some of the latter irregularly barred with white, and thus resembling 
the tail itself; the scapulars externally bright ochre or white, 
forming a considerable shoulder-patch, the inner scapulars more 
coarsely vermiculated than the back and with more tawny ochre; 
wing-coverts coloured like the back and vermiculated with zigzag 
bars of ochraceous buff, changing to yellowish white on the greater 
coverts; primary-coverts and quills dark sepia-brown, banded distinctly 
with lighter brown, these bars much lighter on the outer webs 
of the primaries, and inclining to whitish or yellowish white, the 
bars on the primaries eight in number; innermost secondaries uniform 
with the back; tail blackish, broadly tipped with white and 
crossed with five other bands of lighter brown, inclining to white on 
the inner web, and showing conspicuously when the tail is spread ; 
forehead and crown minutely but very plainly barred with ochraceous,- 
lores whitish, slightly mottled with brown, the shafts elongated 
into black hair-like bristles ; over the eye a broad white band; sides 
of face and ear-coverts ochraceous buff, with whitish shaft-streaks 
and mottled with numerous small bars of brown; at base of beak 
a few white feathers, forming the lower pait of the facial ruff, which 
is whitish, tinged with ochraceous at the tips of the feathers, and 
mottled with small spots of dark brown; entire under surface of 

body ochraceous buff, the throat and chest much mottled with brown 
centres and vermiculations to the feathers ; the breast, abdomen, and 
flanks distinctly streaked with white, many of the feathers being 
entirely white with broad longitudinal centres of dark brown; under 
tail-coverts whitish, some washed with ochraceous buff and having 
slight remains of brown bars ; leg-feathers bright ochraceous buff, 
also with slight remains of barring; under wing-coverts pale ochraceous, 
slightly streaked and mottled with brown near the outer edge, 
the greater series ashy brown, more resembling the inner lining of 
the wing. Total length 14 inches, culmon 1-3, wing 9, tail 5*7, 
tarsus 1*7. 

Younger female. Eather larger than the male, Total length 15 
inches, wing 10-2, tail 6*4, tarsus 1*75. In colour this bird is 
darker brown than the one described, the spots and bars on the head 
inclining to rufous, and the vermiculations on the back very coarse 
and distinct; the under surface deep ochraceous, with the same white 
streaks as in the male. 

Young. Covered with down of a yellowish buff colour, inclining 
to white on the crown, sides of face, and throat. The feathers, 
which are sprouting, exactly resemble those of the adult above 
described. 

Obs. It is scarcely possible to conceive a more variable species 

than the present appears to be, varying in coloration from a light 

brown to nearly black, but always ^ ith a strongly vermiculated 

upper surface: the markings on the chest are difficult to comprehend; 

but the mottlings are more pronounced in young individuals than in 

old ones, the latter having the breast as well as the abdomen streaked. 

The tail is blacker in adults, with whiter cross bands, four in number

Nestling. Covered with pure white down, all the feathers of the 

face and throat, as well as the loral bristles, black, the ear-coverts 

with somewhat of a chocolate shade; wing-coverts light rufous 

brown, with very broad white tips forming bars across the wing; 

quills pale brown, narrowly tipped with white and crossed with, 

numerous bars of darker brown, of which five or six can be distinctly 

counted; tail dark brown, nearly uniform and broadly tipped with 

white, crossed with bars of lighter brown, of which about five can

than the foregoing, differs in having a yellow tinge on the down of 

the wing-coverts and under surface of body; the upper margin of 

the wing dull brown; greater wing-coverts brown, barred across 

and broadly tipped with yellowish white; scapulars varied with, 

broad ochraceous bars, causing a somewhat ocellated appearance, 

the innermost ones barred with white; quills and tail dark brown, 

barred with lighter brown and tipped with white, the bars on the 

latter seven in number. 

Adult male. Above uniform chocolate-brown, blacker on the head; 

wing-coverts uniform with the back, only a few of the greater 

coverts with lighter bars; primary-coverts entirely uniform brown; 

quills brown, narrowly lipped with whitish and crossed with bars 

of lighter brown, nine in number on the primaries and seven on the 

secondaries; scapulars brown like the back, the outermost barred 

with buffy white, forming rather a conspicuous shoulder-spot; tail 

dark brown, tipped with white and crossed with six bars of lighter 

brown; lores white, streaked with black; eyebrow buify white; 

sides of face entirely blackish brown; cheeks and sides of neck 

white ;* throat black; fore neck white, followed by a broad crescentie 

band of chocolate-brown; rest of under surface light ochraceous 

yellow, paler on the leg-feathers; under wing-coverts also ochra


ceous, except the outermost, which are white and form a conspicuous 

spot on the margin of the wing; lower under wing-coverts dark 

brown, like the wing-lining; iris brownish orange, the pupil dark

blue. Total length 19-7 inches, culmen 1-9, wing 14, tail 8*3, tarsus 
2-35. 

Adult female. Bather larger than the male, but very similar, excepting 
that the shoulder-spot is uniform ochraceous, without any 
bars. Total length 23 inches, wing 15*1, tail 8*9, tarsus 2-35. 

Obs. Dr. Pucheran (L c.) separates the Brazilian bird as Athene 
melanota (not the same as Tschudi's species of the same name) on 
account of the bands on the tail being only three in number and 
more narrow. Professor Schlegel, in his first catalogue of the Owls 
in the Leiden Museum, was inclined to keep the Brazilian bird 
distinct on account of its larger size and paler coloration. 1 have 
not been able to find any grounds for separating the northern from 
the southern birds; the former are generally rather darker; but the 
number of bands on the tail will not constitute a specific character 
in these Owls, as it varies with age. In his recent list of Striges, 
Professor Schlegel reunites the Brazilian bird with the Central-
American one.

brown, these bars more or less inclining to rufous; wing-coverts 
chocolate-brown like the back, the least series with a few fulvescent 
bars, the median series greyish at tip and barred across with fulvous, 
more or less inclined to white on the outer web, the bars slightly 
vermiculated with brown, the greater coverts more distinctly ban ed 
and tipped with white; primary-coverts chocolate-brown, barred 
with lighter brown ; quills brown, barred with paler brown, more 
numerously on the secondaries, which are distinctly tipped with 
white, the bars on the innermost secondaries also inclining to white 
on the inner web ; upper tail-coverts rather paler than the back, and 
barred across with white; tail-feathers deep chocolate-brown, barred 
across with ten narrow bands of lighter brown, not conterminous 
on the centre feathers excepting towards the tips, where they are 
regular, the outer feathers with as many as twelve bands on the 
outer web, the inner one being more broadly banded, the bars on 
this latter web inclining to white; feathers over the eye whitish, the 
plumes surrounding the latter black; loral feathers dusky, whitish 
at base but obscured by blackish shaft-streaks; rest of facial aspect 
dusky white, more or less washed with brown and narrowly barred 
with the same in circular lines; feathers of facial ruff glossy chocolate-
brown, more marked with white as they descend to the throat, 
many of the plumes on the latter part white tipped with brown; 
feathers of the side of the neck white, narrowly barred with brown; 
chin dark brown; on the fore neck a crescentic patch of white; 
rest of under surface dull white, everywhere narrowly banded with 
chocolate-brown, the leg-feathers similarly but more minutely barred, 
those on the under tail-coverts browner and broader than on the 
breast-feathers; under wing-coverts similar to the breast, with a 
white spot on the edge of the wing, the greater series blackish, 
barred with yellowish white near the base, thus resembling the 
inner lining of the wing, which is blackish, barred with fulvous 
towards the tips of the feathers, these bars much broader and clearer 
yellowish on the secondaries; " bare joints of toes pale plumbeous, 
the claws dusky lead-colour; bill greenish horny white, bluish towards 
base; cere, which is ill-defined, plumbeous; bare eyelids and eyeshelf

Younger birds appear to me to have the visage much more rufous, 
to have the scapulars less distinctly white externally and generally 
somewhat washed with fulvous, the sides of the neck also being fulvous 
or ochraceous, indistinctly barred with brown. Considerable 
variation is exhibited in the tail, the bars on which are lighter and 
more yellowish in some specimens than in others, some examples 
also having a more distinct white tip to the feathers. The tail-
bands vary from nine to twelve in number on the Nepalese specimens.

Dr. Jerdon keeps Syrnium indranee distinct from S. newarense on 
account of the smaller size of the former bird, the wing measuring 
13-14 inches against 18 inches in 8. newarense. The specimen 
of the latter described by me is a very large bird from the Himalaya 
Mountains; but we havefive Nepalese birds, presented by Mr. Hodgson, 
which give the following dimensions :—

e. Nepal (Hodgson) 23 14'5 9-5 2-4 
Apparently, therefore, the last four of these birds ought to be called 

S. indranee. Want of material prevents my determining the precise 
relations of these two species, as I have no authentic examples ofS. 
indranee for comparison. Mr. Gould has presented to the Museum 
a Wood-Owl which he received from Br. Jerdon, but of which the 
precise locality has not been recorded. This bird is much more fulvous 
underneath, with rufous brown cross bars, very narrow and 
more numerous than in the Himalayan examples. The face also is 
rufous ochre • and I do not believe it to be the true 8. newarense.

Mr. Hume lias noticed the ochraceous disk in Ceylonese birds, and 
proposes the name of oehrogenys* for the island bird. The great 
probability is that examples from Ceylon and the peninsula of India 
will be found to be of the same species, which will be the true 
Syrnium indranee (Sykes). Lord Walden has kindly lent me a 
Malaecan specimen from his collection, obtained by the late Dr. 
Maingay; and this is not to be separated from Dr. Jerdon's skin, 
like which it has the ochraceous disk.

Mr. Eidgway considers that American birds are separable from the 
European as a geographical race. He writes:—"Nyctate ricJiardsoni, 
though without doubt specifically the same as JV. tvngmalmi of 
Europe, is nevertheless to be distinguished from it. The colours 
of the European bird are very much paler; the legs are white, 
scarcely variegated, instead of ochraceous, thickly spotted; the lower 
tail-coverts have merely shaft-streaks of brown instead of broad 
stripes. Very perfect specimens from Europe enable me to make a 
satisfactory comparison."

Southern Europe, but occurring all over the central portions of the

Adult male. Above nearly uniform chocolate-brown, the scapulars 
with a large ovate spot of white on the outer web, the dorsal feathers 
with small concealed spots of white, which are larger and broader 
on the upper tail-coverts; head streaked with white, broader on the 
forehead, more obsoletely on the hinder crown; the hind neck 
mottled with white streaks, and the sides of the neck distinctly 
striped with central markings of white; wing-coverts dark brown, 
with distinct white oval spots on the outer web; quills brown, 
greyer towards the tips, the outer webs spotted with white, these 
spots present only on the primaries, and nearly absent on all the 
others, all the quills, however, being notched with yellowish white 
on the inner webs ; tail dark brown, tipped with white and crossed 
with three rows of white bars, not continuous across the feather; 
lores, eyebrow, and feathers of the face generally dull white, the 
ear-coverts brownish, especially towards the hinder margin; feathers 
in front of the eye and loral bristles blackish; behind-the ear


* Mr. Elliot, in an interesting article on this bird, conclusively showed that 
it was the young of some species of Nyctala; but he considered it to be the immature 
plumage of N. tengmalmi. Mr. Riclgway, on the other hand, refers it 
to N. acadica; and, on consideration of the facts, I believe the decision of the 
last-named ornithologist to be correct. N. albifrons (Licht.), considered to 
belong to N. tengmalmi by some European authors, has been examined by Professor 
Schlegel, and declared by him to be N. acadica.

Nestling. Covered with pure white down, the feathers which are 
appearing on the face being rufescent, those of the ruff silvery white 
with a very faint orange tip to a few of them; primaries orange, 
with faint vermiculations of grey at the tip, the secondaries more 
conspicuously mottled with grey as far as they are developed. {Cambridgeshire,) 


Young bird on leaving the nest General colour above orange, but 
profusely obscured with light grey, all the latter plumes vermieulated 
with ashy brown and having a distinct subterminal white spot margined 
both above and below with brown; the head and hind neck 
coloured like the back, but more decidedly orange, especially the 
sides of the neck, which are bright orange with a few brown spots; 
wing-coverts coloured like the back; primary-coverts orange, mottled 
at the tips like the rest of the coverts, but much paler externally 
and inclining to whitish; quills orange, mottled at the tips 
with greyish, and having distinct cross bars of grey mottled with 
white; tail pale orange, barred with greyish and mottled with the 
same ; facial disk silvery white, the feathers rufous round the eye 
and especially in front of the latter; ruff glistening white, the upper 
plumes washed with orange, and the lower ones also tipped with 
clear orange; feathers of the tinder surface pure white, tinged with 
orange on the chest, but not spotted. This specimen has still plentiful 
remains of the nestling-down. (Cambridgeshire.) 

Adult male. (Shropshire, Eeb. 16th, 1869: J. Gould.) Above 
orange-buff, most of the feathers with white terminal and subterminal 
spots, each relieved by a corresponding spot of blackish; the 
feathers of the back and scapulars a good deal mottled with light 
silvery grey towards their tips, these mottlings disappearing again 
on the upper tail-coverts; sides of neck and least wing-coverts 
orange, with tiny brown spots, the rest of the wing-coverts mottled 
with grey at the tips, like the dorsal feathers; primary-coverts 
nearly uniform orange, with a few greyish mottlings at the tips of 
them; quills orange-buff, shading off into whitish near the base and 
on the inner webs, the secondaries tipped with whitish, the primaries 
with a few irregular spots of brown along the shaft or on the inner 
web, the secondaries rather deeper orange, speckled here and there 
with brown, the innermost mottled with grey at the tip, like the 

294 STRIGID-E. 

dorsal feathers; tail whitish, slightly washed with pale orange on 
the centre feathers, which show a few specklings of brown as well 
as three spots of the same along the shaft, these markings disappearing 
on the outermost, which are almost entirely white; facial 
disk pure white, with a rufous patch in front of the eye; feathers of 
the ruff glistening white, those on the upper parts washed with 
orange, the lower feathers subterminally orange with a tiny apical 
margin of blackish, rather more distinct on the gular feathers; rest 
of under surface of body pure unspotted white, as also the whole of 
the leg-feathers and under tail- and wing-coverts; the lower series 
of the latter slightly shaded with greyish and somewhat resembling 
the inner lining of the quills, which are greyish white below; bill 
nearly white; claws brown; iris black. Total length 13 inches, 
wing 11*9, tail 5, tarsus 2-2. 

DAEE RACE. Adult male. (Schleswig.) Above uniform bluish grey, 
the feathers everywhere most finely vermiculated with greyish white, 
and having two spots of white towards the tip of the leather, one 
terminal and one subterminal, each of these spots relieved by a black 
spot preceding it along the centre of the feather, and imparting a 
streaked appearance to the upper surface; on the head the markings 
are smaller than on the back; but in scarcely any part of the upper 
surface do the orange-buff bases to the feathers show through, so 
that the general aspect is very uniform; wing-coverts coloured like 
the back and similarly marked; primary-eoverts resembling the 
quills, which are deep orange, mottled at the tips with greyish vermiculations 
like the back, and barred across with blackish brown, 
these bars slightly mottled with greyish on the outer margin, the 
orange interspaces also a little mottled with brown ; the secondaries 
marked in the same way as the primaries, but more mottled on the 
outer webs, so that their general aspect is more obscure, the innermost 
being greyish, thickly vermiculated with dull white, and thus 
resembling the back; tail orange, with a broad mottled band of 
greyish at the tip, and crossed by five other bands of blackish, of 
which the two nearest the tip have sundry whitish mottlings ; face 
vinous, inclining somewhat to silvery white on the hinder and lower 
margins of the ear-coverts; the feathers round the eye blackish, 
forming a black patch in front of it ; ruff composed of deep orange 
feathers, some of which have concealed basal streaks of dark brown, 
the gular feathers tipped with the latter colour; rest of under surface 
of body, as well as the sides of the neck, deep orange, dotted 
with minute arrow-head spots of brown, ending in a white tip on 
some of the abdominal plumes and under tail-coverts, the spots becoming 
obsolete on the leg-feathers; under wing-coverts orange like 
the breast, and spotted in the same manner, the lower series whitish, 
tipped with greyish black, and thus resembling the inner lining of 
the quills, which are whitish, barred on the inner web with greyish 
black, and inclining entirely to greyish black at the tip. Total 
length 13 inches, wing 11*8, tail 5-5, tarsus 2*3. 

Obs. It will be seen from the above synonymy that I have united 
nearly all the Barn-Owls of the world under the one heading ofSfruv

flammea. It is seldom that an opportunity is afforded to the ornithologist 
of examining such a line series of birds as has been permitted 
to me in the case of the Barn-Owls; and it would be difficult 
to find a more comprehensive collection than at present exists in the 
British Museum. Every single variation of the ordinary type has been 
examined by me; and I have had in all cases one or two specimens 
of the rarer or more obscure forms on which to found my conclusions. 
Mr. G. E. Gray, in the ' Hand-list/ has recognized no less than twelve 
species; but a very short study will suffice to show that not one half 
of these species can be maintained. Mr. Eidgway also separates 
the Barn-Owls into different races, and he considers that seven can 
be differentiated. The first of these is Btrix flammed, inhabiting 
Europe and the Mediterranean region of Africa. In America it is 
represented by S. gratincola, the habitat of which is Mexico and 
southern North America, the only character given by Mr. Eidgway 
being, however, its larger size. A difference of an inch and a half in 
the wing is the extreme variation that I can find, this measuring in 
European examples from 11 to 12-4 inches, in American ones from 
12-9 to 13-7 inches. The latter have the tarsus measuring 2-65-3*01 
inches, against 2-2 to 2-5 inches in the European. The colour of the 
American bird is darker; and the dark phase, which is rarer in the 
Old-World birds, seems to be the permanent form in the New "World. 
Indian Barn-Owls are rather darker than European and clearer grey 
above, in the latter respect becoming more like the Australian S. tielicatula, 
whose pearly grey colour has been its chief specific character 
; sometimes, however, Australian examples are not to be distinguished 
from European; wing, in the latter, 10-8-11-3 inches, tarsus 
2-4-2-6. Mr. Eidgway then separates S.javanica (from India and 
Eastern Africa) as a bird of the same colours as S. clelicatula. The 
African Barn-Owl, according to my experience, is always darker 
than the European, especially the specimens from Southern Africa; 
but they are again scarcely distinguished from the dark phase of #. 

flammea. The Indian examples, on the contrary, run paler in colour, 
and are often nearly uniform grey on the back. In Java and the 
Malayan subregion a slight modification takes place, and the trace 
of zigzag markings on the breast, sometimes discernible in Indian 
birds, becomes tolerably well pronounced, especially in $. rosenlergi, 
which is a large form of S. javanica, and is not allied to $. novm 
Jiollandice. The same character divides Mr. Eidgway's S. guatemalce 
from S. pratincola or 8. flammea; and this zigzag marking on the 
breast is extremely developed in the St.-Domingo Barn-Owl (S.glaucojps 
of Kaup). The Cuban and Jamaican bird is at first sight 
remarkable, chiefly for its white tail; but in this respect it resembles 
British specimens, which, although matched by Erench birds, are 
quite different from any I have as yet seen from Germany. Strioe 
insularis is a small dark form, supposed to be peculiar to the Cape-
Yerd Islands, but approached by some Senegambia specimens. It is 
closely allied to the Galapagoan 8. punctatissima* S. jperhta from 
South America is smaller than the North-American bird, and comes, 
therefore, very close to the European S. flammea. 

296 SXBIGIDiC. 

My conclusion with regard to the Barn-Owls is, that there is one 
dominant type which prevails generally over the continents of the 
Old and JNew "Worlds, being darker or lighter according to different 
localities, but possessing no distinctive specific characters. Insular 
birds vary, but cannot be specifically distinguished, as they can 
always be approached by continental specimens in a large series. 
Thus S.furcata, of Jamaica, appears different, but is scarcely to be 
distinguished from Bogota specimens, which possess a white tail also. 

8. insularis, of the Cape-Verd Islands, is scarcely to be separated 
from some Senegambian skins. 8. glaucops is not very different from 
Yeraguan Barn-Owls; and these are again approached by Malayan 
specimens. Of these two extreme forms, 8. insularis and 8. glaucops, 
an illustration is given (PL XIV.). I give detailed descriptions and 
measurements of a few of the most striking forms of Barn-Owl which 
have been specifically separated by different authors; and in the list 
of specimens I have divided them under the headings by which they 
have become known to systematists. 
a. Strix furcata. 
Adult male. Above pale orange-buff, the feathers coarsely vermiculated 
at the tips with greyish brown, the markings more spot-like just 
before the terminal white longitudinal spot; crown of head richer and 
more of a golden orange, and more spotted than the back, especially 
on the sides of the neck, which shade off into pure white; wing-coverts 
orange-buff like the back, the least series minutely spotted, the 
median and greater coverts vermiculated near the tip with grey, disappearing 
on the primary-coverts, which have only a few scattered 
mottlings, some of the lesser coverts externally inclining to white 
like the edge of the wing; quills pure white, the outer primaries 
slightly shaded with orange-buff, and coarsely vermicnlated with 
ashy brown at the tips, as also the secondaries, some of which have 
a few scanty vermiculations on the outer web, the innermost orange-
buff, vermiculated with grey like the back; tail pure white ; facial 
disk white, with a patch of rufous feathers in front of the eye; ruff 
composed of orange-buff plumes, inclining to white on the lower part, 
a few of the upper feathers with tiny spots of brown; entire under 
surface pure white, with the remains of a few tiny spots on the flanks. 
Total length 14*5 inches,wing 13*1,tail 5*8, tarsus 2*95,middle toel-6. 

Adult female. Darker than the male, and more profusely mottled 
with grey on the upper surface; wings externally orange-buff, with 
scattered dots of black on the outer web, and indications of three 
blackish bars on the inner one, the ends of the feathers very coarsely 
vermiculated, the outermost of the secondaries inclining to white; 
tail white, with remains of three imperfect bands and tiny dots on 
most of the feathers; underneath white, tinged with orange-buff on 
the chest and flanks, both of which, as well as the under wing-coverts, 
are spotted with ashy brown. Total length 14-5 inches, wing 13-4, 
tail 5 2, tarsus 2-95, middle toe 1*65. 

Obs. It is evident that the unspotted wing and pure white tail are 
gradually acquired by the disappearance of th e bars and vermiculations. 

1. STRIX. 297 
/J. Strix delicatula. 
Adult. Above pearl-grey, with faint zigzag grey mottlings on all 
the feathers, which have mesial white tips preceded by a spot of 
dusky blackish; wing-coverts coloured like the back, the mottlings 
a little coarser, edge of the wing and outer margin of the bastard 
wing pure white,-the rest of the latter resembling the other coverts; 
primary-coverts resembling the other series, with distinct white 
apical spots, and washed near the base with orange-buff; quills 
externally mottled with grey, with a subterminal white drop; the 
primaries externally washed with pale orange, inclining to white 
near the base, all the quills white on the inner web, showing conspicuously 
when the wing is spread, primaries with remains of four 
dark brown cross bands; tail-feathers whitish, mottled with coarse 
vermiculations of brown, and crossed with four bars of the latter 
colour, the markings disappearing on the outermost tail-feather, 
which is almost entirely white, with the remains of three bands only; 
facial disk pure white, with a dusky rufous patch in front of the eye; 
ruff composed also of pure white feathers, the uppermost with central 
streaks or zigzag cross markings of black, becoming narrower on the 
lower ones and disappearing on the gular plumes of the ruff, some few 
of which have a narrow brown tip ; rest of under surface of body pure 
silky white, with no dusky spots on the chest, but a few on the sides 
of the body and abdomen, and indications of some tiny ones on the 
under wing-coverts, the lower series of which are dusky at tip, forming 
a faint wing-bar; the quills underneath white, mottled at the 
tip with greyish, and having three faintly indicated dusky spots or 
bars on the inner web; bill horn-colour; feet yellowish. Total 
length 13 inches, wing 11, tail 4*7, tarsus 2*35. 

y. Strix punctatissima. 
Adult (type). Above dull brown, with a few scattered spots of 
dusky white, and minute flecks of the same on the dorsal feathers ; 
sides of neck light golden buff, indistinctly marked with transverse 
lines of brown, becoming gradually obscure and disappearing on 
the hind neck; the wing-coverts more or less washed externally 
with deep golden buff, many of the white spots also tinged with 
the same colour, the buff predominating along the edge of the wing 
and at the base of the primary-coverts * quills dull brown like the 
back, slightly varied with minute flecks of white, and vermiculated 
with golden buff on the outer webs, much more distinct on the primaries, 
where it forms four irregularly defined bands; the secondaries 
with a distinct white terminal spot; the inner lining of wing 
ashy brown, the base of the feathers buffy white, the inner webs 
with two or three indistinct bands of whitish; tail golden buff, barred 
across with four bands of dark brown, the interspaces vermiculated 
with the same colour, especially towards the tips of the feathers, 
which are there almost entirely brown, with a white terminal spot; 
general colour of face vinous rufous, inclining to black round the 
eye; the cheeks silvery white, washed with rufous; facial ruff rich 

STBIGID-E. 

golden buff, white at base of feathers, which are coarsely vermieulated 
with brown, sometimes in a horseshoe pattern; crown of head 
deep golden buff, vermiculated with brownish; under surface of 
body rich golden buff, transversely vermiculated with brownish bars, 
irregular in shape and more distinct on the abdomen, the under wing-
and tail-coverts coloured like the breast, but the latter rather paler; 
bill yellowish, horn-coloured at base ; feet blackish. Total length 
13 inches, culmen 1*7, wing 9-2, tail 4*6, tarsus 2-3. 

2. Strix roseubergi. 
Adult male. Above greyish brown, all the feathers finely speckled 
with whitish and tipped with white, the feathers being subterminally 
brown in the centre; so that the upper surface has a distinctly spotted 
appearance, here and there relieved with a wash of orange-buff where 
the bases show; wing-coverts rather greyer than the back, but 
spotted in the same manner, the median and greater series rich 
orange-buff, only varied with the greyish vermiculations towards the 
tips of the feathers, which are largely mottled with brown on the 
outer webs; quills rich orange-buff on the outer, mottled with brown 
and vermiculated with greyish near the tips of the feathers, all of 
which are barred across with dark brown, the inner webs duskier, 
and the light interspaces obscured with brown mottlings ; the secondaries 
externally varied with greyish vermiculations exactly like the 
back, which the innermost secondaries precisely resemble; tail orange-
buff, tipped with greyish white and mottled with dark brown vermiculations 
on the interspaces, the dark brown bars five in number; 
facial disk white; the lores and plumes in front of the eye rufous, 
those immediately in front of the latter black; feathers of the ruff 
rufous orange, barred and tipped with brown vermiculations; the 
gular plumes white, tipped with brown and subterminally washed 
with orange rufous ; throat wrhite ; the rest of the under surface rich 
orange-buff, slightly washed with silvery white in the centre of the 
body; the lower abdomen also whitish, all the lower parts marked 
with triangular spots of brown, the subterminal spots being the 
largest, the chest at the same time slightly varied with indistinct 
zigzag bars of brown, all the spots vanishing on the under tail-coverts; 
the under wing-coverts rich orange-rufous, spotted with brown like 
the breast, some of the feathers washed with silvery white, the lower 
series yellowish white at base, ashy brown at tip, forming a wing-bar 
and resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are yellowish at 
base of inner web and barred with ashy brown, these bars disappearing 
towards the tips, which are entirely ashy brown. Total length 
17 inches, wing 12-9, tail 6-3, tarsus 2*85. 

Obs. Another specimen, collected by Dr. Meyer, measures as 
follows—total length 18 inches, wing 13, tail 6-5, tarsus 2*9. It 
is very much the same in colour as the one described, but is darker, 
so that the white spots show everywhere more distinctly; on the 
underparts there are remains of circular bars on many of the feathers, 
particularly those of the chest.

Adult (light phase). General colour golden "buff, mottled with 
black and white, the tips of the feathers being black, thickly spotted 
in an irregular manner with white, the scapulars barred externally 
with blackish; the hind neck rather paler and more yellow ; crown 
of head greyish black, thickly spotted with white; wing-coverts 
coloured exactly like the back, and mottled in the same manner; 
primary-coverts deep orange, tipped with white, barred with blackish 
brown, and mottled with the latter colour at the tip; quills orange-
buff, barred with dark brown, the buff interspaces mottled with 
brown markings on the outer margin, and especially so on the inner 
web, which is much more dusky; the secondaries externally mottled 
with greyish white, and tipped with white, distinctly barred across 
with blackish brown; tail-feathers golden buff, tipped slightly with

Adult (dark phase). General colour above greyish black, the 
feathers distinctly spotted with white, generally along the shaft and 
at the tip of the feathers, which are also speckled all over with 
whitish ; the upper surface very slightly varied with orange-buff, a 
few of the bases of the feathers which are of this colour showing 
through here and there; the scapulars externally orange-buff barred 
with blackish, and forming an indistinct shoulder-patch- wing-
coverts coloured like the back, the spots being distinct on the least 
and median series, but less visible on the greater coverts, which are 
like the quills; the latter are dull brown, everywhere thickly and 
coarsely mottled with greyish white; all the quills barred across 
with dark brown, the secondaries tipped with white ; tail greyish,

Adult. General colour above chocolate-brown, with a very few-
zigzag lines of white on the feathers of the upper surface, most of 
which have also a tiny arrow-head spot of white near the tip, these 
spots extremely small on the head and hind neck; all the upper surface 
varied here and there with rich golden buff, wherever the bases 
of the feathers show through, many of them being barred with this 
colour, especially on the outer aspect of the scapulars, where they 
form a kind of shoulder-patch; wing-coverts a little darker than 
the back, but marked in the same manner, the golden buff colour 
not showing very plainly, except on the outermost coverts and 
bastard wing; primary-coverts deep chocolate-brown, irregularly 
barred with orange-buff, and slightly vermiculated with whitish 
lines near the tips; quills dark brown, indistinctly barred with 
golden buff, inclining to fulvous on the inner web, all these buffcoloured 
bars more or less obscured with brown mottlings; tail 
dark brown, crossed with about six distinguishable bars of golden 
buff, plainer than on the wings, but yet more or less obscured with 
brown mottlings, especially towards the tips; facial aspect light 
chestnut, the feathers in front of the eye black, the loral plumes also 
slightly tipped with black; facial ruff deep golden orange, with a 
mesial spot of dark brown near the tip, becoming broadly tipped 
with brown on the lower part behind the ear-coverts, the gular 
plumes more rufescent but not so broadly tipped with brown; rest 
of under surface of body golden buff, the chest-feathers with 
a double spot of blackish near the tips, the flanks with larger 
horseshoe bars of blackish, broader but less distinct at the tips of 
the under tail-coverts* under wing-coverts and axillaries very deep 
golden buff, spotted at the tips with brown like the chest, the lower

the quills, which are ashy brown below, barred with yellowish white 
near the base of the inner webs; bill yellowish brown; feet light 
yellow. Total length 21 inches, wing* 15-2, tail 7, tarsus 3*2. 

Obs. 8. castanops is a large, permanently dark form of S. novce

only differences are, in fact, the largo size and the number of tail-
bands, which sometimes amount to as many as eight. A comparison

Obs. 3. jpithecops of Formosa does not seem to be a distinct species 
; and Mr. Swinhoe in his last list of Chinese birds unites it to 

8. Candida, The specimen in the Museum differs from Indian examples 
only in its rather larger size, and in having live bands on 
the centre tail-feathers ; the greater series of under wing-coverts 
also are barred across with greyish brown. None of these characters, 
however, are of specific importance in the genus Stricc.

chequered with white on outer web and barred with deep black 
very distinctly, the under surface of the wing dull rufous, the cross 
bars very distinct; lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts uniform 
bay, with very indistinct brown spots and very slight indications of 
white streaks; tail deep chestnut-bay, crossed with five or six blackish 
bars, gradually disappearing towards the tips ; frontal feathers and 
face dull whitish, with a certain pinkish shade, especially on the former; 
feathers round and in front of the eye deep chestnut; facial ruff deep 
chestnut, with buffy white bases to the feathers and narrow blackish

buff on breast, slightly washed with pinkish, the abdomen and flanks 
more decidedly glossed with a pale vinous pink shade, inclining to 
buffy white on the vent and under tail-coverts ; the breast sparsely 
spotted with dull brown, becoming rather larger and darker on the

chestnut, forming a large patch near the outer edge of the wing, 
the greater series buffy white, excepting the outermost, which are 
spotted with dusky blackish in the form of bars ; tarsus buffy white, 
unspotted; bill yellowish; toes brown; claws yellowish ; iris black.

inches, wing 8, tail 3-4, tarsus 2. 

Obs. Mr. Hume is not sure of the specific identity of the Phodili 
from all the localities mentioned. Writing on a Ceylonese example 
he observes:—" The Ceylon bird differs from the Nepal race in its 
somewhat smaller size, in the much closer and darker banding of 
the lower surface of the quills, in the dark brown patch on tha wing-
lining at the base of the first two or three primaries (this patch 
being bright chestnut in the Nepal bird), in the dark brownish tint 
of the lesser wing-coverts along the ulna and of the whole crown, 
in the conspicuous black banding (almost obsolete in the Nepal bird) 
of the outer webs of the quills, in the much closer banding of the 
tail, and in the darker tint of the back, and especially of the lower 
part of it; in fact the bird seems referable rather to the Malayan 
than the Himalayan race."

very coarsely vermiculated; on the head and neck a triple set of bands, 
one across the occiput, very faintly indicated by a few whitish bands 
to some of the feathers ; on the nape a second band of tawny feathers 
relieved by a few white spots; on the hind neck a clearer band 
caused by the buff or buffy -white bands, which are on most of the 
feathers; white scapular spots very distinct and large, the outer 
web of many of the feathers being entirely white with a black tip ; 
least wing-eoveits blackish, with vermiculations of sandy rufous, the 
markings on the median and greater series much coarser, with broad 
white tips like the scapulars, preceded by sandy mottlings ; primary

coverts uniform blackish brown; quills brown, externally notched 
and mottled with sandy rufous or white ; the secondaries blackish, 
everywhere mottled and vermiculated with sandy rufous like the 
back; tail brown, copiously mottled and vermiculated with pale 
sandy rufous, clearer at the tip, the outer feathers vermiculated on 
the outer web and narrowly banded on the inner one with sandy 
rufous; lores and a broad band over the fore part of the eye white, 
the feathers of the former very full and having the shafts produced 
into black bristles, most of these feathers edged with rufous brown; 
plumes round the eye chestnut, with narrow whitish shaft-streaks ; 
ear-coverts whitish, with concentric bars of rufous and black; ear-
tufts coloured like the head ; facial ruff white, many of the upper feathers 
behind the ear-coverts barred with tawny and more narrowly 
with brown cross lines, the lower part of the ruff under the chin 
white, with a few narrow blackish cross lines; chin-feathers pure 
white; general aspect of under surface sandy rufous, many of the 
feathers with a distinct central streak of black, all the feathers vermiculated 
with dark brown bars and broadly barred with white, the 
latter prevailing on the flank-feathers, which are almost entirely 
white with sandy-rufous bars; the centre of the abdomen pure white ; 
the under tail-coverts white, washed with tawny, and mesially 
streaked with black; leg-feathers orange; under wing-coverts buffy 

white, some of the outermost washed with tawny and mottled with 
brown markings, the lower series tipped with ashy brown, and thus 
resembling the inner lining of the quills, which are uniform ashy 
below, inclining to fulvous near the base of the inner web, the secondaries 
internally barred with fulvous; bill horn-brown; toes yellowish. 
Total length 7*5 inches, wing 5-25, tail 2-8, tarsus 1*2. 
(Mus. Brem.) 

This Scops Owl is perfectly intermediate between the J3. giu group 
and JS. spilocephahis. It has the mottled upper surface of the latter 
bird, but differs from this species in having stripes on the under 
surface. The flanks in 8. giu, capemis, and allies are white streaked 
with black and crossed with narrow zigzag cross lines of black ; but 
in 8. leucopsis the flanks are white with broad sandy rufous cross 
bars. The absence of streaks on the upper surface is also a character; 
and the ruff is white, with narrow black bars, but there is no black 
ring marking the ruff as in & giu. 

The following modification in the synoptic table of Scops becomes 
necessary:—

Ninox podargina, Sharpe, atitea, p. 151, note. 

This species was referred by me to the genus Ninox in the absence 
of a personal examination of the specimen. Since the first sheets 
of this volume were printed, I have been favoured by the Museum 
Grodefiroy with the loan of the typical example, which is not in the 
best condition. There can, however, be no doubt that the bird is a 
Scops of the yellow-billed group, and that its place will be found to 
be next to Scops balli and its allies. The following modification in 
the synopsis (p. 47) is therefore necessary:— 

c". Under surface very strongly vermiculated 
with fine zigzag lines of blackish; upper 
surface of a rufous chocolate tint, spotted 
with rufous ochre; frontal band not very 
broad. 


e'". Size large: wing 6*35 inches, tarsus 1*3, 
middle toe 1; claws deep brown podarginus^.SlS. 
f". Size much smaller; wing 5*45 -5*6 inches, 
tarsus 1-15, middle toe 0*8; claws yellow balti, p. 100. 

The following is a description of Scops podarginus:— 
Adult (type of species). General colour above chocolate-brown, 
rather rufous in tint, everywhere obscurely mottled with blackish

vermiculations, and relieved by bars or diamond-shaped spots of 
buffy white; scapulars with distinct spots of white on the outer 
web; the greater wing-coverts also with some distinct diamond-
shaped spots of white; quills brown, externally sandy rufous, lighter 
than the back, the primaries with a few spots of buffy white on the 
outer web; the secondaries entirely sandy rufous at the tip, with a 
few obscure rufous bands throughout the length of the feathers; 
upper tail-coverts coloured like the back, many of them barred 
across with white or buffy white; tail dark brown, sandy rufous at 
tip, with more or less distinct rufous bands on the rest of the 
feathers; lores very full, buffy white, washed with rufous near the 
tip, the black shaft-streaks produced; frontal plumes and a few 
feathers over the fore part of the eye whitish, tipped and narrowly 
barred with brown; plumes round the eye rufous brown; ear-
coverts sandy rufous, mesially streaked with buffy white; ruff apparently 
sandy rufous, narrowly barred with black, and inclining 
to buff near the base; some of the lower plumes tipped with white 
and subterminally barred with black ; under surface of body sandy 
rufous, with narrow zigzag cross lines of black, most of the feathers 
subterminally barred with white or tipped with a large diamond-
shaped spot of white, the flank-feathers distinctly barred with 
whitish; tarsi very scantily plumed, bare for more than the lower 
half, the plumes on the upper portion sandy rufous, with tiny bars 
of dark brown; under wing-coverts white, broadly barred with 
black or brown, especially distinct on the edge of the wing; bill 
yellow; feet dusky, claws dark brown. Total length 8*8 inches, 

wing 6*35, tail 3-6, tarsus 1*3. 

Hah. Pelew Islands. 

This species is extremely like Scops haUi from the Andamans, a 

species which, through Mr. Hume's kindness, I am able to compare 

with it. It is, in fact, a large edition of it, but is apparently to be 

distinguished by its dark brown claws and big feet. Like 8. bcdli 

it has a very bare leg; but the exact amount of feathering is rendered 

a little difficult to determine by reason of the condition of the spe


cimen, which has been mounted after having been preserved in 

spirits. This fact accounts for the absence of ear-tufts (which, 

however, I can distinguish a little). Mr. Keulemans's plate in the 

Journal of the Museum Godeffroy does not represent the bird 

well, as, like the original describers, he has mistaken it for a Ninox 

or JSfoctua; and the peculiar feathers which he has drawn on the 

chest are, I believe, only two ordinary plumes of the ruff, rendered 

conspicuous by the falling off of all the other overlying feathers in 

the specimen.
