PREFACE. 

THE Fourth Volume of the < Catalogue of Birds in the British 
Museum' has been prepared "by llr. II. B. Sharpe, one of the 
Senior A^i-stants in the Zoological Department, and author of 
the three preceding volume.-*.* ' It contains an account of all the 
species of Ciiuii/ujJifHjiihe and Mascjica^bltx known at present. 
From the authors account it would appear that nearly one fouith 
of the species known are still unrepresented in the British iXuseum; 
and the hope may he expressed that ornithologists and collectors 
will assist in rendering this part of the National collection more 
complete than it is at present. 

ALBEET GUXTHEE, 

Keeper of the Department of Zoology. 

British Museum, 
March 1879. 


INIKODITCTION, 

IN the present volume the second group of the Fasseriformes or 
Perehing-birds, containing the Gichlomorplice^ has been commenced, 
and the first two families, consisting of the Cuckoo-Shrikes and 
Ely-catchers, have been described in detail. The total number of 
species enumerated is 539, of which 443 are represented in the 
Collection of the British Museum. A considerable proportion of the 
missing species will no doubt ultimately be found to be identical 
with others included in the present volume. In many cases, the 
absence of generic characters in the writings of the original describers 
of certain species has rendered it extremely difficult to assign to them 
their proper position with any degree of certainty. 

Some idea of the way in which the number of described sj>ecies 
of these families has increased during the last ten years may be 
gathered from the following facts, which also bear testimony to the 
rapid increase of the ornithological collection in the British Museum 
during the same period. 

In 1869, when the last list of Carrvpojpkagidce was published by 
the late Mr. GL R. Gray, in the 6 Hand-list of Birds/ the number of 
described species was 87, of which 72 were in the Museum collection, 
represented by about 250 specimens. 

In the present year the number of described species is 148, and 
of these 127 are in the collection, represented by 514 specimens. 
The number of described species of Musticcvpidce in the year 1869 

IKTRODTTCTIOff. 

V1U 

appears to have boon 253, and the Museum contained 191 of these, 
represented Iby 958 specimens. 

In the present volume 391 species of Ply catchers are described; 
and of these thorc are 316 in the collection of the British Museum, 
represented by 2006 specimens. This great increase in the number 
of examples has taken place, notwithstanding that a great many 
deteriorated specimens have been eliminated from the collection. 

The author has once more the pleasing duty of thanking the 
numerous friends and fellow labourers who have given him more 
and more assistance every year. It would have been scarcely 
possible to have completed the present volume in the time it has 
occupied, on account of the large number of species recently 
discovered in the Papuan islands, had not Count Salvadori brought 
with him to England, and placed in the author's hands, the entire 
series of specimens belonging to the Civic Museum of Geneva, including 
the types of all the species lately described by him. Dr. A. 

B. Meyer has likewise most kindly sent over all the specimens 
collected by him during his voyage in Papuasia, containing the 
types of many species unrepresented in collections in this country. 
During a recent visit to Leyden the author received the greatest 
assistance from Professor Schlegel, who gave every facility for 
the study of the large collections contained in the Museum of that 
city. 
The Museum is indebted for presents to the following gentlemen:— 
Lord Lilford, Capt. Stackhouse Pinwill, Capt. G. H. T. Marshall, 
Governor Usshor, C.M.G., Colonel Sturt, Lieut. H. Trevelyan, Major 
Hayes Lloyd, Mons. E. Pierre, Capt. Vincent Legge, Henry 
Seebohm, Esq., and L. Mandelli, Esq. 

The special thanks of the author for valuable assistance and loan 
of specimens are due to the late Marquis of Tweeddale, Prof. 
Peters, John Gould > Esq., P. L. Sclater, Esq., Professor Newton, 
Osbert Salvin, Esq., P. DuCane Godman, Esq., Prof. Alphonse 
Milne-Edwards, Dr. Otto Einsch, A. 0. Hume, Esq., C.B., Baron 

A. von Hiigel, Capt. Shelley, Eugene Oates, Esq., Prof. Barboza du 
CraBODUCTION. 

Bocage, E. P. Ramsay, Esq., Messrs. GodefFroy, H. J. Elwes, Esq., 
and Howard Saunders, Esq. 

As in the former volumes, the affixes to the names of the persons 
from whom the specimens were obtained may be explained as follows 
._« [p.] » means " Presented by; " " [C] "=" CoUected by;" 
" [E.] " = " Obtained by exchange." Where Done of these signs are 
used, the specimens were purchased. In some cases the sexes of 
the specimens are enclosed in brackets, as [ <$ ]. This is to indicate 
that although the author has no doubt in his own mind that the 
specimen is a male, the label attached to the individual bears no 
indication of the sex.

In the course of the examination o! the families described in the 
present volume, I have come to the conclusion that two genera at 
least should belong to the Prionopidse, and not to the families in 
which they are generally placed. These are the genera Cochoa and 
Phceomis, the former placed near Wiltava (Muscicapidse), and the 
latter in Eopsaltria (Laniidse) by the late Mr. G. B. Gray. 

The genus Cochoa must be inserted immediately after Grallina 
(Cat. B. iii. p. 272) and between that genus and TepJirodornis; and 
the key on p. 270 must be modified as follows :— 

a. 
Distance between the primaries and the secondaries 
greater than the length of the tarsus. 
«'. Wing short or moderate, falling short of the tip of 
the tail by more than the length of the culmen j no 
eye-wattle. 


au. Tail square or slightly rounded, shorter than the 
wing. 
a,u. First primary moderate; second primary longer 
than the secondaries.

middle toe without claw .,,.,., . GHAIXINA.

Hab. Sandwich Islands. 

G OICHLOAIOEPH-E. 

Order PASSERIFORMES. 
Group II. CICHLOMORPH^. 


"Wing with ten primaries, the first more or less markedly reduced 
in size; angle of the chin shortened, and not reaching as far as the 
line of the anterior margin of the nostril; claw of middle toe oblique ; 
rictal bristles generally present. 

Bill notched or grypanian (Illiger), i. e. with the cnlmen nearly 
straight, bent at the end in an arched curve, acuminate, generally 
incised at the sides ; nostrilb placed low, nearer to the cutting-edge 
of the mandible than the culmen. 

Of. Sundevall, AY. Meth. Tent. p. 3. 

With the present group commences an account of the Thrush-like 
Passeres, the difficulties in classifying which are not likely to be 
exaggerated by any one who attempts the task. As already stated 
in this work, the system of classification here adopted is founded on 
that of the late Prof. Sundevall, who, however, admits (Av. Meth. 
Tent. p. lviii) that the divisions he proposes for the Cichhmorphw 
are purely artificial. I have endeavoured to modify his arrangement 
; but in attempting to draw a hard-and-fast line between 
groups which nature has connected by intermediate forms, the 
difficulty of dealing with the connecting links has to be faced. I 
have preferred to accept a line which is capable of definition, even 
in cases where forms, apparently nearly allied, must be separated, 
being convinced that any line, wherever drawn, must be open to the 
same objection. In cases where two great groups are separated by 
both internal and external characters, and the connecting forms 
exhibit the internal characters of the one along with the external 
characters of the other, it seems to me that, in a classification of birds' 
skins in a museum it is obvious that the intermediate forms should 
be thrown into the series with which they correspond in external 
characters. The second great difficulty which I have had to meet 
has been that of bringing groups of birds having lateral affinities to 
adjacent groups into a linear arrangement—a difficulty similar to that 
of attempting to make such a list of the countries of Europe as shall 
place them correctly in geographical relation to each other. It is obvious 
that this can only be done by occasionally making a fresh start. 

The characters here given, therefore, to the Turdiform families, 
which appear to follow one another in a natural sequence, cannot 
be considered exhaustive, but represent those which seem to me the 
salient points peculiar to each. 

Synopsis of Families.

the secondaries with grey on the outer webs, the primaries narrowly 

margined with white; tail-feathers black, tipped narrowly with 

whitish; a narrow frontal line ; lores and feathers in front of the 

eye, feathers above the eye, sides of crown, cheeks, and ear-coverts 

black, with a greenish gloss ; chin blackish at base ; throat and chest 

dark grey; rest of under surface white, barred across with black 

transverse lines, wider apart and broader on the under tail-coverts; 

under wing-coverts white, barred with the same black cross lines 

as the breast; " bill, legs, and feet black; iris crimson lake " (Hume), 

Total length 11*3 inches, culmen 1*1, wing 6-3, tail 5, tarsus 0*95. 

Adult female. Differs from the male in having the entire under 

surface from the chin downwards barred with blackish cross lines, 

instead of the throat and breast being grey; thighs slaty black. 

Total length 12 inches, culmen 1*1, wing 6-05, tail 5*35, tarsus 

0-95. 

Young. " Whole chin, throat, and breast strongly tinged with 
ferruginous, the tertiaries, secondaries, and later primaries comparatively 
broadly margined and tipped with pale rufous or rufescent 
white ; the tertiaries and later secondaries have also a rufous spot 
near the point, and exhibit traces of having been barred ; some of 
the upper tail-coverts, some of the scapulars, and a few of the back-
feathers still remain rufous barred with blackish brown, peeping out 
amongst the new iron-grey feathers; a dull rufous superciliuni running 
from the nostrils over the eyes ; the lores are dusky, with tiny 
white spots, and the cheeks also are dusky, the feathers white-
shafted, and, from what I can judge, the whole upper surface of the 
nestling bird must be banded rufous and dark brown. In other specimens 
further advanced the ferruginous patch is smaller and confined 
to the breast; no banded feathers remain on the upper surface, 
which is like that of the adult, and the conspicuous rufous margins 
of the quills have become narrower and paler." (Hume.)

Obs. In deference to the opinions of a practised observer in Madagascar 
like M. Grandidier, I have here considered my G. major to 
be only the adult male of G. cana. I was misled by the fact of two 
of the smaller form having been marked as males by Pollen and Tan 
Dam, whose specimens are still in the Museum.

Adult male (Yule Island, May 26, 1875, D'Alheriis). General 
colour above light French grey, the wing-coverts like the back, with 
edgings of still lighter grey; primary-coverts and primaries black, 
externally edged with grey, inclining to white towards the tips of 
the quills; secondaries black, the outer aspect of the feathers light 
grey on the innermost, with the outer web grey and the inner one 
black; two centre tail-feathers ashy grey, blacker towards the tip, 
which is white, all the other feathers black, washed with grey 
towards the base and tipped with white, which increases in extent 
towards the outermost feather, which is also edged with white along 
the outer web ; entire forehead, feathers above the eye, ear-coverts, 
sides of face, sides of neck, entire throat, and fore neck black, with 
a greenish gloss, fading off paler towards the chest, which is iron-
grey, becoming gradually lighter and more delicate grey on the sides 
of the body, so as to leave only the lower abdomen and under tail-
coverts pure white ; thighs grey; under wing-coveits and axillaries 
pure white, as also the inner lining of the quills, w7hich are otherwise 
ashy grey below; " bill black ; feet dull ashy; iris black " 
(DAlbertis). Total length 12*5 inches, culmen 1*05, wing 7'65, 
tail 5*75, tarsus 1*05. (Mus. Givic* Genov.) 

Obs. Not having a good adult male from Australia in the Museum 
collection, I have described a fine specimen from Yule Island which 
appears to me to be identical. This species varies much in size, but 
it is impossible to believe in the existence of more than one species; 
and G. parvirostris is little more than a race of the present bird. 

c?, Louisiade Islands, wing 8*1 inches ; $ , SVW. Australia, 
wing 7*1 inches. These two seem to be the extremes, and every 
intermediate link between them can be found. 

Adult female. Like the adult male {Gould). 

Young, Differs from the adult in wanting the black forehead and 
throat, only the lores, feathers round the eye, and ear-coverts being-
black ; breast grey; throat whitish, with wavy bars of dusky blackish, 
the breast with remains of greyish bars.

Adult male. General colour above dark ashy grey, the scapulars 
and lesser wing-coverts like the back; the greater series and the 
quills blackish, narrowly margined with ashy grey; lower rump and 
upper tail-coverts white; tail-feathers black, outer ones ashy at tip, 
the centre ones shaded with ashy towards the base; feathers at base 
of forehead, lores, feathers above and below the eye, upper ear-
coverts, and chin black* remainder of the sides of face, throat, and 
breast dark ashy grey, fading paler towards the abdomen, which, 
with the lower flanks, vent, and under wing- and tail-coverts, is 
white ; quills ashy below, white along the inner webs of the 
feathers ; thighs ashy grey. Total length 11-5 inches, culmen 1*05, 
wing 6, tail 5, tarsus 0*95. 

Adult female. Differs from the male in being lighter grey, and in 
having no black on the lores or sides of face. Total length 11*5 
inches, culmen 0*9, wing 5*9, tail 4*9, tarsus 0*9. 

Young female. Differs from the adult in having conspicuous 
white tips to the tail-feathers, the secondaries being broadly edged and 
tipped with white, the primaries more narrowly. The general colour 
of the upper surface is light grey, as also are the sides of the face, 
throat, and breast, the grey not extending so far down as in the 
adult, and all traces of black on the lores and round the eyes being 
absent; white upper tail-coverts tipped with brown; breast with 
dusky bars of grey * thighs white, varied with grey. Total length 
11 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 5-6, tail 4-8, tarsus 0*9. 

This specimen still has a few of the young feathers remaining, 
whence it seems that the white edgings to the secondaries and tail-
feathers are signs of youth.

The birds from this part are Graucalus layardi, Blyth (cf. Walden,Ibis, 
1873, x). 310); but although birds from Darjiling do show some 
differences from Madras examples, those from North-western India 
are intermediate, and I am unable to define specific characters.

CAMPOPHAttlDiK. 

Yauny male (Andai, August 1872, J)1Alberth). At first resembles 

the old female, but gradually gains the adult male plumage by the 

double action of a direct moult and by a change of feather; " bill, feet, 

and iris black" (ZfAlbertis). "Wing 4*45 inches, (Mus. Civic, Qenov.) 

A male bird from Port Moresby differs from others from Northeastern 
New Guinea in having bronzy-green edgings to the wing-
coverts; but as lean see a trace of an occasional green shade on the 
margins to the wing-coverts in some of the latter, I do not propose 
to separate as a species the southern bird. The appearance mentioned 
is not like the green shade in E. dispar, which is a good 
species.

The female is not fully adult, and has the inner secondaries and 
the outer tail-feathers tipped with white; the under tail-coverts are 
rufous, barred with dark slaty grey, from which it may be inferred 
that the young bird is entirely marked in this manner on the under 
surface.

Adult female (Lutor, June 24, 1873, Beccari). Entirely unlike 
the female of E. incertum, and resembling that of E. tenuirostre, but 
dark brown on the back without any grey shade, the latter being 
confined to the crown, where it is not very distinct; wing-coverts 
and quills edged with chestnut; eyebrow and sides of neck chestnut, 
as also the light streaks on the ear-coverts; under surface of body 
chestnut or very deep fawn-colour, barred across with arrow-shaped

Adult male (Miosnoum, May 1, 1875, Beccari). Above slaty 
blue, including the wing-coverts, the median and greater series slaty 
blue with black bases; bastard wing and primary-coverts entirely 
black; quills black, the primaries narrowly, the secondaries more 
broadly edged with grey ; two centre tail-feathers ashy grey, with a 
large spot of black near the tip ; remainder of the tail-feathers black, 
tipped with ashy grey, more broadly on the outermost, which is grey 
also along the outer web; feathers at base of bill, lores, feathers in 
front of the eye and under the fore part of the latter black ; base of 
lower mandible blackish, and the ear-coverts with, a blackish, shade;

below, greyish white along the inner web. Total length 8*4 inches, 
culmen 0-9, wing 4*45, tail 3*4, tarsus 0*95. (Mus. Civic. Genov.) 
Adult female (Ansus, Jobi, April 1873, Br. A. B. Meyer; type 
of species). Yery like the male, but having the two centre tail-feathers 
entirely ashy grey without any subterminal black spot. Total 
length 8*7 inches, culmen 0*8, wing 4*5, tail 3*5, tarsus 0*95. (Mus. 
Dresden.) 

The type specimen above described agrees also with a female from 
Ansus (Bruij)i) in the Genoa Museum; like it, the centre tail-
feathers are uniform, with no subterminal black spot. The Miosnoum 
bird, which I cannot believe to bo distinct, is rather brighter 
blue-grey and has a good-sized black spot at the tip of the central 
tail-feathers. This may be the character of the male bird.

Adult female. Above palo olivaceous dusky brown, the rump 
more ashy, the feathers for the most part banded with blackish and 
tipped with white; quills brightly and conspicuously margined with 
yellow ; wing-coverts broadly margined with faint yellow before a 
terminal bar of black; tail-feathers olivaceous dusky brown,, the 
outer ones more blackish, the two outermost at the tip and on the 
margin bright yellow; below whitish, partly washed with yellow 
and broadly banded with dusky; under wing-coverts and thighs 
bright yellow ; '* bill dusky blackish: feet greenish dusky ; iris

Obs. In the Museum are specimens of female birds agreeing with 
Von Houglin's descriptions above quoted; but as they were not 
identified by the collectors as being C. p7ioemcea, and they may be 

G. ocantliomoides, I have thought it best to quote the descriptions of 
Heuglin, which are authentic, as he has apparently only met with 
one species. See also my remarks on C. ocantliomoides.

Adult male. General colour above and below glossy steel-black,

median wing-coverts bright orange-yellow, forming a large shoulder-
patch ; quills sepia-brown below, washed with olive along the inner 
webs. Total length 7*2 inches, culmen 06, wing 3*G5, tail 3-5, 
tarsus 0*75. 

Young male. Above ashy brown, the head, neck, and mantle uniform 
; scapulars yellowish, barred across with black; lower back, 
rump, and upper tail-coverts paler and more whity brown than the 
rest of the back, here and there tinged with rufous, narrowly barred 
with glossy greenish black ; wing-coverts dull yellowish, the median 
and greater series dark brown, edged and tipped with bright yellow; 
quills brown, margined with yellow; tail-feathers blackish, tipped 
with yellow, increasing in extent towards the outermost, the middle 
feathers olive, browner on the inner web ; lores and eyebrow white; 
round the eye a ring of buffy white feathers, and in front of and 
behind the eye a dusky blackish spot; ear-coverts pale ashy brown, 
with whitish shaft-streaks; throat white, with scarcely any cross-
markings ; rest of under surface of body white, somewhat washed 
with yellow and barred across with blackish lines; under wing-
coverts and inner linings of quills bright yellow. 

Obs. The above description is taken from an Accra skin, sent along 
with an adult male of the present bird; the female bird is very 
similar without doubt, but that the present is a male and not a 
female is proved by the presence of a single bright orange feather 
among the wing-coverts. It is strange that with a bird by no means 
rare in collections there should be so much difficulty in finding out 
the correct female plumage ; but the majority of skins roach us without 
any indication of sex. In his recent book Professor Bocage has 
endeavoured to solve the question by making tho yollow-shouldered 
bird (G. xantkornoides) tho female of the Mack Caterpillar-catcher 
of South Africa ( Cnigra). This is scarcely feasible; for, in the first 
place, I have the female bird of the latter, sent with the male by 
Mr. T. C. Atmore, both sexes having been determined by dissection*. 
Again, if G. ccanthomoides were the female of G. nigra, how is it 
that we do not find tho latter in "West Africa, but only the former ? 

It has also been put forward that G. xantliomoides is a stage of 

G. flmniQea. This seems more probable, as the two birds are 
almost of the same dimensions, and only differ in the colour of tho 
shoulder-patch. Governor TJssher thought that the yellow-shoulder^ 
bird was the older; but this I cannot coincide with, as we have in 
the Museum a specimen commencing to put on the yellow shoulder 
while still in tho mottled or young plumage. .That the other species 
changes direct from a similar plumage to tho full scarlet shoulder 
* Vide infra, p. 63. 
CAMPOPHAGIDJE. 

seems to be proved by Isidore GcofTroy's plate of C. jphosnicea. 
Lastly, if the two birds are identical, how comes it that only a 
yellow-shouldered bird occurs in South Africa, and that a red-
shouldered bird has never been seen there ?

Total length 8*5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 3*75, tail 3*6, tarsus 0*8. 

Adult female. General colour above olive-yellowish, brighter on 
the rump and upper tail-coverts; head and nape uniform grey; 
wing-coverts olive-yellow like the back; quills brown, externally 
margined with olive-yellow; tail-feathers olive, browner on their 
inner webs, tipped with pale yellow, increasing on the outer web 
towards the outermost feathers; lores whitish, mottled with dusky 
edges to the feathers, extending a little behind the eye and forming 
an indistinct eyebrow; round the eyes a ring of buffy white feathers; 
in front of and behind the eye a dusky blackish spot; ear-coverts 
dusky brown, with narrow white shaft-lines; throat buffy white; 
rest of the under surface of the body bright yellow, including the 
under wing- and tail-coverts and the lining of the quills. Total 
length 7*2 inches, wing 3*85, tail 3*8, tarsus 0*75. 

Young. Similar to the female, but mottled on the upper surface, 
the feathers being edged with dull white, before which is a subterminal 
bar of brown * wing-coverts and secondaries tipped with pale 
yellow and subterminally barred with brown; throat white; rest 
of under surface bright yellow, the breast rather thickly barred 
across with brown, these bars less numerous on the flanks and under 
tail-coverts 

Obs. The changes of plumage in this species are satisfactorily explained 
by the series in. the British Museum. A bird was sent home 
by Mr. Blissett to the author as a dissected female of one of the 
West-African Caterpillar-catchers; and there is no doubt of its being 
a female of the present species, as he also sent a young male 
changing from the immature plumage (exactly like that of the adult 
female) to the glossy dress of the male. The feathers being donned 
on the wing-coverts are not yellow or red, but steel-black, showing 
that it cannot be referred to any species but G. quiscaliyia.

" It is very close to Volvocivora melaschistus, and, as such, I originally 
identified it; but with twenty-four specimens before rne I find 
that, sex being ascertained, no specimen of it can be mistaken for a 
specimen of the corresponding sex of V. melaschistus; but it is much 
the same size, and the old males are as nearly as possible the same 
colour as the females of V. melaschistus. Except as regards colour, 
I can point at present to no unfailing and absolute diagnosis between 
it and V. melaschistus. But, as a rule, the exterior lateral tail-feather 
is longer. In no specimen is this latter more than 1*2 inch shorter 
than the middle one, and, as a rule, it is only about 1 inch shorter. 
Usually there is a great deal more white upon the tail, the white 
tippings being conspicuously broader. As to size of bill, I can say 
nothing; for in both this race and the true V. melaschistus the bill 
varies extraordinarily in dimensions. Wing of males varying from 
4-5^-4-84, of females from 4*4-4-7." (A. 0. Hume.)

Adult male (Hainan, Feb. 1868; type of species). General 
colour above very dark slaty grey, the upper tail-coverts with obsolete 
whitish margins; wings black, with a slight greenish gloss, the 
quills narrowly margined with ochraceous or buffy white; tail-

broader towards the outermost; the middle tail-feathers shaded with 
grey towards the base; sides of face dark slaty grey, the feathers in 
front of the eye blackish; under surface of body dark slaty grey, 
paler on the under tail-coverts, the longest of which are tipped with 
white; under wing-coverts and axillaries like the breast, those on

steel-green gloss, the least wing-coverts like the back, the rest of 
the coverts and the inner secondaries with obsolete greyish edges to 
the feathers, the primaries also with remains of grey margins ; tail-
feathers black, with a steel-green gloss, all of them tipped with 
white, the two centre feathers edged with grey more narrowly, 
the others broadly, the white tip increasing in extent towards tho 
outermost; the feathers in front of and round tho ey^, oar-coverts, 
and cheeks rather dusky • under surface of body bluish grey like the 
back, paling on the abdomen, the thighs dark slaty, the under tail-

Adult [female]. General colour above cindery grey, becoming 
conspicuously lighter on the lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts, 

* Dr. Hartlaub, in his ' Monograph,' refers this species of Kiippell's to C> 
lugubris; but this it cannot be, as the under tail-coverts are white (ventre et

which are decidedly ashy grey; least wing-coverts like the back, 

remainder of the wing-coverts and quills black glossed with steel-

green and narrowly edged with grey; centre tail-feathers grey, 

gradually shading off into greenish black towards the ends of the 

feathers, which are narrowly edged with ashy grey at the tips ; re


mainder of the tail-feathers black, glossed with steel-green and tipped 

with white, becoming broader on the outer ones; lores and feathers 

in front of the eye hoary grey ; ear-coverts grey, with white shaft-

lines ; remainder of under surface light grey, becoming more of a 

fulvous ashy colour towards the abdomen, the under tail-coverts 

creamy white ; thighs ashy grey; under wing-coverts and axillaries 

ashy below; quills ash-coloured underneath, with a large spot of 

white on the inner webs of the middle primaries. Total length 0*^5 

inches, culmen 0*75, wing 4*5, tail 4*1, tarsus 0*85. 

Obs. I was inclined to consider the bird here described as a female 

to belong really to another species, on account of the white patch on the 

primaries ; but I find that Mr. Hume notices it in the female 0, mela


noptera. An examination of Mr. Swiuhoe's specimens from Ningpo, 

Foochow, and Canton shows that the birds determined by him to 

be Volvocivora melaschistus are really referable to G. melcmoptera.

Adult male. " Lores blackibh dusky; the cheeks and ear-covertb 
are blackish slaty; the entire upper surface of the bird, including 
scapulars and lesser wing-coverts, the chin, throat, upper breast, and 
sides of the neck are of a beautiful uniform blue-grey, paler than in 
the palest female V. melaschistus, but darker than the male V. avensis. 
The colour is slightly darker on the crown, where, as in other 
species, there is a faint indication of darker striations, and it is 
slightly paler on the rump and the upper tail-coverts; the ear-
coverts are duskier, but scarcely darker than crown and throat; 
the lower breast and abdomen and the wing-lining are the same 
colour as the rump, becoming paler towards the vent, which, with 
the lower tail-coverts, are pure white; the wings, except the lesser 
wing-coverts, are black, with a distinct greenish lustre; the median 
and greater coverts, secondaries, and tertiaries are edged with the 
colour of the back; the primaries, except the first four or five, arc 
narrowly margined and conspicuously, though narrowly, tipped with 
white; the tail is black, the central tail-feathers grey for nearly 
half their length, margined with paler grey throughout and tipped 
with noarly pure white; the whole of the lateral tail-feathers are 

broadly tipped with pure white, the external ones most broadly so 
to the extent of about half an inch ; the cxtorior lateral tail-feathers

" Two old females, unfortunately not measured in the flesh, are 
precisely similar, except that tho wings, which measure 3*8 and 3-95 
respectively, want the slaty and white edgings and tippings, and also 
want the grey shade on the tail, while the four central tail-feathers 
have almost dropped their white tippings. In these two the exterior 
lateral tail-feathers are 0*6 and 0'G5 shorter than the central 
ones." (Hume.) 

Hah, South of the Tenasserim provinces. 

Obs. The diagnosis of the species is given by Mr. Hume as follows 
:—£i Intermediate in colour between V. melasoJiistus and V. 
mdanoptera vel avensis, but much smaller than either: wing in the 
largest male 4*17 ; outermost tail-feather only, at most, 0*75, and 
generally only about 0-65 inch shorter than central tail-feathers." 

11. Campophaga polioptera. (Plate II.) 
Adult. General colour above ashy grey, rather darker on the head

bastard wing and primary-coverts black, narrowly margined with 
grey ; primaries black, narrowly edged with grey, whitish towards 
tho tip and very broadly white on the inner web ; secondaries black, 
externally grey, inclining to white at the tips; two centre tail-feathers 
ashy grey, shading into black towards the tip, which is white ; remainder 
of the tail-feathers black tipped with white, which tip 
increases in extent towards the outermost, where it is very broad ; 
sides of face like the crown, a little dusky in front of the eyes and 
on the ear-coverts ; under surface of body light grey, darker on the 
throat and paling towards the abdomen and vent; under tail-
coverts white ; under wing-coverts and axillaries light grey; quills 
dusky brown below, the inner webs white for more than half their 
length. Total length 8*3 inches, oilmen 0*6, wing 4*15, tail 3*4, 
tarsus 0*75. 

Adult female (?). Differs from tho adult male in having hoary 
whitish edgings to the feathers of the rump and upper tail-coverts; two

Very like P. speciosus, but distinguished by its smaller size and 
by having the outer webs of tho centre tail-feathers red. Mr. Hume 
writes :—" Like P. speciosus, the first two primaries in the adult 
male and the first three in the female and young male alone want 
the bright patch on the outer web. No doubt there is a distinction 
in the tails, in that out of 26 adult males examined, in every one 
the outer webs of the tail-feathers were red, whereas only three out 
of 27 P. speciosus had any red on the outer webs of the middle tail-
feathers. Again, taken as a body, the backs of the females are 
somewhat darker, and the red of the males somewhat more flammeous." 
Dimensions of wing given by Mr. Hume are as follows:—" 
In the males it varied from 3*6 to 3-77 inches, and in the females 
from 3-5 to 3-8."

" This species, like P. andamanensis, has no coloured patch, on the 
first three primaries in the adult male, or in the first four in the 
female. In colour the female approaches P. flammeus• the outer 
webs of the central feathers appear to he always red. In colour the 
female is more like those of P. speciosus and P. elegans, with more 
yellow on the forehead, and of a much more orange-yellow below 
than the female P. flammeus. The wings of my specimens measure 
:—males from 3*47 to 3*5 inches, females from 3*35 to 3-42." 


(Hume.) 

Obs. I identify a specimen in the collection with Mr. Hume's 

species, which seems to be a distinct one. Unfortunately our bird 

is in changing plumage and has lost its tail, so that it was not 

available for description.

Adult male. Upper surface of body ashy grey, the rump bright 

vermilion, as well as the upper tail-coverts; tail black, the four 

outer feathers orange towards the tip, decreasing in size towards 

the inner feathers; wing-coverts black, edged with dull grey, the 

greater series with a tiny orange tip; quills black, inclining to grey 

towards the tips, the bases to the inner primaries conspicuously 

orange-red, forming an alar speculum, two of these feathers with 

an additional streak of orange along the outer web ; a very narrow 

frontal line, lores, sides of face, and throat ashy black; the breast 

vermilion, washed with orange and shading off paler on the flanks, 

the centre of the abdomen whitish, the under tail-coverts with a 

yellowish tinge; under wing-coverts and edge of the wing yellow, 

some of the greater coverts with ashy black bases; thighs ashy 

black; bill and legs black; iris brown. Total length 6 inches, cul


men 0*45, wing 2*55, tail 2*9, tarsus 0-65. 

Adult female. Unlike the male: light grey above, the scapulars 
and wing-coverts uniform with the hack; throat white, the rest of 
the under surface yellowish, deepening on the flanks and much 
brighter on the under wing-coverts; quills lighter and more brown 
than in the male, the primaries with narrow whitish edgings, the 
yellow wing-spot as in the male; rump vermilion; tail as in the 
male. Total length 6 inches, culmen 0-45, wing 2*75, tail 3*1, 
tarsus 0*6. 

Obs. The examples from Southern India have blacker throats than 
those from Nepal, but specimens from the Central Provinces seem 
to be intermediate. The Javan birds have grey throats, but the 
Ceylonese specimens have this part black. Mr. Hume's remarks, 
where he proposes to separate the northern birds as P. peregrinus 
(L.) and the southern ones as P. malabaricus (Gm.), are to be consulted 
(Str. F. 1877, p. 182).

" Clearly a miniature of P. brevirostris, and like it has the first 
four primaries in both sexes plain on the outer webs. The total 
length varies from Q'5 to 6-8 ; the tail from 3*0 to 3*25 ; the wings 
varied—males 3*25, 3*3; females 3-2, 3*37, 3*32. Seeing, however, 
that the eastern form of P. brevlrostris is smaller than the 
western, I should not have separated these birds, though smaller 
than the smallest Sikhim and Shillong specimens, merely on account 
of difference of size. Nor would the proportionally much larger 
bill have satisfied me of their distinctness, nor even the fact that in 
both my males the black of the throat appears to descend further 
on the breast than in any one of forty-six males of P. brevlrostris, 
as this might be due to some stretching of the skin in preparing it; 
but when with these differences is coupled a female of a wholly 
different type, with the upper surface of a much darker grey, and 
with the chin, throat, and entire lower surface of the rich bright 
hue of adult female P. speciosus, a hue not approached, as regards 
chin and throat at any rate, by any one of the twenty-seven female 

P. brevlrostris now before me, I could not avoid recognizing what is 
clearly a distinct species."

Adult male. Black, with a slight blue gloss, the sides of the face 
and throat also black; rest of under surface of body scarlet vermilion, 
the thighs blackish, with pale rosy tips; the under wing-coverts 
rather paler vermilion than the breast, the lower series ashy black; 
wings black, the greater coverts entirely vermilion, except the innermost, 
which are black with red edgings; quills with a very broad 
vermilion band, increasing in extent along the primaries, this colour 
absent on the outer web of the first to the fourth of these quills and

confined to the inner web only ; lower back, rump, and upper tail-
coverts scarlet-vermilion; two centre tail-feathers black, slightly 
edged and spotted at the tip with vermilion, the rest vermilion, with 
black bases, increasing in extent on the inner web towards tho 
middle of the tail; bill and feet black. Total length 7*5 inches, 
culmen 0*5, wing 3*35, tail 3*85, tarsus 0*55. 

Adult female. Similar to the male, and having a black head; the 
back and least wing-coverts blackish, with dull crimson edgings to 
the feathers; greater coverts black, broadly tipped with vermilion ; 
wings and tail otherwise as in the male; forehead, eyebrow, sides 
of face and entire under surface of body rosy vermilion; thigh-
feathers blackish, with pale rosy tips. Total length 7*5 inches, culmen 
0*5, wing 3*2, tail 3*8, tarsus 0*55. 

Ohs. P. miniatus is extremely close to P. brevirostris, but may be 
told by the rosy colour on the thighs near the tarsal joint, and by 
the vermilion colour of the greater wing-coverts; in P. brevlrostns 
these are black with crimson tips. The females are quite different.

* Boie, in naming this genus in 1826, gave no description, but indicated the 
type as lurdus orientals, G-m., which has been recognized as such by all subsequent 
ornithologists. In 1858 (that is to say, thirty-two years later) he states 
(J. f. O. 1858, p. 359) that this is all a mistake, and that he meant Tardus 
mindanensis to be the type o£ Lalage, having confounded the two species together. 
Boie must be held to his original type, as the name of Lalage is in common use 
everywhere, and its being transferred to Copsyohus would lead to irretrievable 
confusion: no one but the proposer is answerable for the original blunder, 
which could not be suspected by any subsequent writers. 
The following species have been placed in the genus Lalage:—

* The oldest name for this bird is, no doubt, Turdus dominieus of P. L. S. 
Muller (S. 35F. Anhang, p. 145 ; Cass. Pr. Philad. Acad. 1864, p. 251), a gentleman 
who brought out an edition of Linnseus's ' Systema NaturtB' and included 
species published since 1766. The date at which he wrote (1776) enabled him 
to name several of D'Aubenton's ' Planches Enlumin^es,' to which he was the 
first to give titles. It is a great question whether this author is entitled to 
recognition at the hands of ornithologists, as he was apparently colour-blind— 
witness his bestowing the name of viridis upon the rufous-and-grey Terpsiphone 
of Soiiih Africa, and casfanea upon the totally black Vhilepitta jala of Madagascar 
I In the case of Lalage terat he has committed himself greatly, as he has 
not noticed the numbers of the figures on D'Aubenton's plate, and has named 
the upper bird ("Merle des Indes orientales") dominica, instead of the under 
figure, which represents a bird from San Domingo ; to this he has given the name 
of indicus.

web white and also a portion of the edge of the inner web ; primary-

coverts and quills black, the secondaries externally bordered with 

white, forming a longitudinal bar down the wing ; lower back, rump, 

and upper tail-coverts clear grey, the latter with silvery grey edges ; 

tail-feathers black, narrowly edged with steel-green, tipped with 

white, these tips much broader on the outer feathers, the two centre 

ones shaded with grey towards the base of their inner webs; nasal 

plumes, lores, and a broad eyebrow white; a spot in front of the eye 

and a streak behind the latter, above the ear-coverts to the sides of 

the nape, black; sides of face, ear-coverts, and entire under surface 

of body pure white, with a slight greyish tint on the breast and 

flanks ; under wing-coverts and inner lining of quills white for more 

than half the inner web; " bill black; legs and feet black or 

plumbeous; soles yellowish horny; iris brown" (Hume). Total 

length 6-1 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3-85, tail 2*85, tarsus 0*8. 

Adult female. Differs from the male in being entirely grey above, 

lighter on the rump and upper tail-coverts, the fetter with whitish 

edges, the head and mantle with blackish streaks down the centre of 

the feathers; below white, the breast narrowly barred with obscure 

greyish cross lines • two centre tail-feathers grey at base and for the 

greater part of their inner webs; " bill black ; legs blackish grey ; 

iris dark brown " (A. Everett), Total length 6*3 inches, wing 3*6, 

tail 2*&, tarsus 0*8. 

Dr. Hartlaub describes the female as similar to the male, but 

Count Salvadori (' Uce. .Born.' p. 147) identifies this sex as having a 

grey back. I have described Labuan birds sent without labels by 

Mr. Low and Governor Ussher, but evidently male and female. 

Mr. Everett has settled the question by sending correctly dissected 

specimens from Luzon which agree with the Labuan birds described 

by me. Salvadori hints at the probability of the Bornean bird being 

specifically distinct from that of the rest of the Malayan archipelago, 

but I find Philippine examples not differing from those of Labuan. 

Lord Tweeddale says that birds from Southern Borneo have a longer 

wing and larger bill than those of Java, 

Young. Like the old females, but the grey back more or less suffused 
with brown, the feathers in some parts edged with whity brown ; 
below the dusky cross lines are broader, and the chest is washed with 
sandy buff; the greater wing-coverts have zigzag cross bars of 
blackish. 

Count Salvadori describes the young as being " like the females, 
but varied with white above and longitudinally streaked and spotted 
with du«ky below." This must be a younger stage than I have yet 
seen.

Adult male. General colour above greenish black, the sides of the 
neck white, so as to form almost a collar round the hind neck; rump 
and upper tail-coverts grey, with buffy white margins to the feathers, 
the upper tail-coverts having a subterminal shade of black ; scapulars

secondaries more broadly; tail-feathers black, narrowly tipped with 
white, becoming broader towards the outer feathers, the two outermost 
having a large white apical spot; lores white, continued into 
a broad superciliary streak, succeeded by a second line of greenish 
black drawn from the base of the bill through the eye and including 
the upper edge of the ear-coverts; cheeks, ear-coverts, and entire 
under surface, including the under wing-coverts and the base of the 
inner web of the quills, white; thighs white, with black bases; " upper

Adidt female. Browner than the male, the head only greenish 
black and contrasting with the back, the feathers of the upper 
surface being edged with lighter brown; rump and upper tail-
coverts ashy, the feathers edged with buffy white, with a subterminal 
bar of black, imparting a barred appearance to this part; tail brown,

tipped with white, only the two outer tail-feathers having white 
apical spots of large size; white margins to the quills and wingcovorts 
narrow and not forming a patch as in the male; rest of 
plumage as in the latter, but the sides of the face, sides of neck and 
of body below barred with zigzag cross lines of dusky black; " iris 
dark brown " (Brenchley). Total length &5 inches, wing 3*6, tail 
2*7, tarsus 0*85. 

The female described is from M'Bau Island, Fiji (Brenchley), as I 
have not seen a dissected specimen from Tongatabu. The Fiji and 
Friendly Islands birds are, however, specifically identical, though 
specimens from the former group appear to be smaller, the wing not 
exceeding, as a rule, 3*45 inches in length. 

Young. Differs from the adult in having the feathers of the upper 
surface edged with rusty colour or hoary white; the wing-coverts 
and quills margined with rusty, the white wing-coverts with large 
black centres; sides of face, breast, and flanks mottled with zigzag 
cross markings of blackish. 

Two young birds from Samoa are ashy brown above, white below, 
with remains of wavy arrow-head lines of dull brown, and have 
yelloiv bills.

Adult male. General colour above glossy black, with only the 

faintest shade of green; sides of the neck white, encroaching behind 

so as to form a half-collar; lesser wing-coverts margining the edge 

of the wing black, the rest of the lesser coverts as well as the median 

series pure white, the former with black mesial streaks forming a 

conspicuous shoulder-patch ,* greater coverts black, with broad white 

endings to the outer webs ; primary-coverts black, narrowly tipped 

with white ; quills black, the primaries narrowly margined with 

white, the secondaries more broadly; some of the outer scapulars 

with white terminal spots; long upper tatl-coverts with a shade of 

grey; tail-feathers black, all tipped with white, increasing in extent 

towards the outermost, which are very broadly tipped with white ; 

a broad white eyebrow from the base of the nostrils to the sides of 

the nape, succeeded by a broad streak through the eye from the base 

of the bill to the nape; ear-coverts, sides of face, and entire under 

surface of body pure white, including the under wing-coverts and 

quills at base of the inner web; thighs white, with blackish bases. 

Total length 6*4 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3*95, tail 2-8, tarsus 1-05. 

Female (not quite adult). Black like the male, but with a few 

remains of greyish edges to the rump-feathers and upper tail-

the body below with dusky zigzag cross lines. Total length 6*8 

inches, wing 4*05, tail 3-1, tarsus 1*05. 

Ohs. This species appears to be quite distinct from L. paeijim, 
from which it differs in its black rump. The female bird is not 
quite mature, and shows that in the young plumage it resembles the 
young of L. pacifiea. Another difference is seen in the white spots 
on the scapulars, and also in the very broad white tips to the tail-
feathers.

Family MUSCICAPID.E. 

Passerine birds of very varied form, and embracing within their 
limits a large number of genera. The affinities of the family lie in 
several directions, but they connect the Wood-Shrikes with the 
Thrushes by means of a gradual succession of genera, so that, as a 
family, the characters of definition are most obscure. Some of the 
genera evince a great likeness to the Timeliidae, such as Lioptilus; 
to the Prionopidae, as in the case of Gassinia; and especially to the 
"Warblers, as in the case of Gryjptolopha and Gerygone. The most 
perfectly developed Flycatchers are probably the Paradise Flycatchers 
(Terjpsiphone), the Fantails (Rhipiclura), and the broad-billed 
Myiagrce and the allied genera. Prom these birds, with their broad, 
flattened bills and ample bristles, there are gradations on all sides 
towards the families mentioned above; and the series is in some 
instances so complete, that it is difficult to draw an exact line of 
distinction, so that some of the outlying genera might almost be included 
in the Timeliince or in the Syhiinw.

Adult male. General colour above brown ; least wing-coverts 
uniform with, the back, the greater series dark brown with lighter 
brown tips to the median series, the greater coverts tipped with 
whitish; primary-coverts and primaries dark brown, the secondaries

of buffy-white feathers ; feathers below the eye and ear-coverts 
brown like the crown; cheeks white, mottled with brown bases to 
the feathers; throat white, widening out on the lower part and separated 
from the cheeks by a broad moustachial line of brown; breast 
and sides of body ashy brown, the former slightly mottled with 
grizzly white edgings to the feathers; abdomen and under tail-
coverts pure white; thighs brown; under wing-coverts light tawny, 
with dusky bases to the feathers, the quills ashy brown below with 
an edging of light tawny to the inner webs; " upper mandible

legs and feet brownish black; iris dark brown " (Armstrong). Total 
length 4-9 inches, culmen 04, wing 3-15, tail 2*2, tarsus 0-5. 

Obs. The description is from a specimen collected by Dr. Radde in 
Eastern Siberia on the 18th of May, 1856, and therefore in full 
breeding-plumage. Examples from other parts of China and the 
Himalayas are similar, but great variation takes place in this species 
as regards the tone and intensity of the brown colour both on the 
upper and under surface, and also in the uniform or mottled colour * 
of the breast. The coloration of the throat is very different in individuals, 
being in some almost uniform brown, succeeded by a jugular 
spot of white. 

Young (Peking, Sept. 1868, B. JSwinJwe). Ashy brown, mottled 
with whitish streaks and terminal spots to the feathers, the greater 
coverts edged and tipped with buffy white, the rest of the* coverts 
spotted with whitish at the tip like the back ; primary-coverts and 
quills dark brown, the inner secondaries edged and tipped with pale 
rufous ; under surface very thickly mottled with brown, the feathers 
being white with dusky brown edges. (Mus. H. Seebohn.)

128 MTJSCICAPIM1. 

Adult male. General colour above ashy brown, the wing-coverts 
rather darker than the back, and the greater series edged with 
rusty brown; primary-coverts sooty brown; wing-coverts dark 
brown, the secondaries edged with rusty, paler at the tips; tail 
brown, like the back; lores and a ring of feathers round the 
eye bnffy white; in front of the eye a dusky spot; ear-coverts and 
cheeks brown; throat and rest of under surface of body pure white, 
the sides of the neck, breast, and sides of body suffused with brown ; 
under wing-coverts and axillaries light fawn-brown; quills dark 
brown below, light fawn-colour along the inner web; " bill black, 
the lower mandible yellowish at base; legs dark van dyke-brown ; 
iris chocolate " (A. Everett). Total length 4*8 inches, culrnen 0-45, 
wing 2-75, tail 1*95, tarsus 0*55. 

Mr. Hume observes (Str. P. 1873, p. 219):—" The colours of the 
soft parts vary somewhat. In some specimens the legs, feet, and 
upper mandible are brown, in some black, or nearly so; in all the 
gape, inside of the mouth, and lower mandible are yellow, paler and 
purer in some, more orange in others, and the tip of the lower 
mandible is always brownish." 

Young. Differs from the adult in being flammulated above, the 

feathers having large ovate spots of ochraceous buff in their centres, 

the wing-coverts and quills being edged with rufous-buff; sides of 

face light brown streaked with buff; under surface of body white, 

mottled with dusky brown edgings to the feathers ; upper tail-

coverts and edges to the tail-feathers rufous. 

Obs. Considerable variation takes place in this species, but only 
as regards the colour of the brown upper surface, which differs in 
intensity, and as regards the brown on the chest; this varies in extent, 
being sometimes broad, sometimes narrow, and occasionally 
dissolved into obscure streaks. The edges to the wing-coverts and 
quills are often rufescent, and this is probably a sign of immaturity. 
I cannot see the least reason for separating Alseonax terricolor 
of Hodgson, notwithstanding Mr. Brooks's opinion that they constitute 
distinct species; and I have had the opportunity of comparing 
with the Museum series two specimens belonging to Mr. Seebohm, 
and determined as A. terricolor by Mr. Brooks himself, to say nothing 
of a large series of the typical specimens from Nepal.

Adult male. Crown of the head and nape dusky greyish black; 
forehead and eyebrow white, produced backwards so as to form a 
border to the crown, and joining on the nape, forming a conspicuous 
white nuchal spot; lores and sides of the face, including the eye and 
the ear-coverts, glossy black, extending down each side of the neck 
to the limits of the white nuchal patch; back greyish, with the 
slightest tinge of ashy brown on the interscapular region, the white 
bases to the scapulars and rump showing through and producing a 
slightly mottled appearance; upper tail-coverts glossy black ; wing-
coverts black, the median and inner greater ones broadly tipped with 
white, so as to form a conspicuous alar bar; quills brown, the secondaries 
darker and more inclining to blackish, the outer ones bordered 
with white, forming a narrow white line continuous with the alar 
bar above mentioned; tail-feathers black, obsoletely tipped with 
white, the two outermost feathers broadly bordered and tipped with 
white; under surface of body white, with a broad pectoral band of 
glossy blue-black feathers, the flanks also mottled with black; under

Adult female. Differs from the male chiefly in having the pectoral 
band deep chestnut, instead of black ; a slight tinge of rusty colour 
is also apparent below the nuchal spot. 

Young. Immature birds generally have the wing-coverts tinged 
with rusty. Young males at first resemble the old female, and afterwards 
gradually assume the black band on the breast. A specimen 
from Casamance in the collection resembles the adult male, except in 
having the back clear brownish grey, with a decided fulvous tinge on 
the interscapular region. Another bird, still younger, in the Museum, 
is olive-brown above, darker on the head, where it is beginning 
to get black; all the black parts of the plumage are much 
tinged with brown, and the white markings obscured by a wash of 
pale rusty fulvous; the outer tail-feather is obliquely white towards 
the tip.

Adult male. Upper surface deep glossy blue-black, with a very 
slight greenish shade, inclining to grey on the rump, where the 
feathers are long and fluffy; the nape indistinctly mottled with 
whitish, only seen on disarranging the feathers ; wing-coverts glossy 
black like the back, the median ones white, forming a distinct bar 
across the wing; quills greyish black, the primaries outwardly 
margined with a narrow whitish line, broader and more conspicuous 
on the outer secondaries, whence it is continuous with the alar bar 
described above, the inner secondaries glossed with dark green, one 
or two of the longer ones just tipped with whitish; upper tail-
coverts and tail-feathers glossed with dark rifle-green above, blackish 
below, all the feathers tipped with white, becoming broader on the 
outer rectrices, and forming a conspicuous lateral border on the 
outermost ones ; sides of the face like the upper surface of the bod}-; 
cheeks and entire under surface of the body pure white, with a 
conspicuous band of blue-black across the breast, the Hank-feathers 
long and silky; tibial plumes black, tipped with white; under 
wing-coverts as well as the bases of the primaries white, the small 
outer-coverts glossy blue-black, with a little spot of white below 
the carpal bend of the wing; bill black; feet (in skin) blackish; 
wattle over the eye semicircular in form and bright scarlet in life. 
Total length 4*8 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2*5, tail 2, tarsus 0*75. 

Adult female. Above dusky cinereous, with a slight gloss of 
greenish, the rump lighter; quills and tail as in the male, the white 
edgings very broad and conspicuous ; chin white; throat and breast 
deep maroon, bordered below with a narrow band of glossy black; 
rest of the under surface white; under wing-coverts white, and the 
wing-lining a little lighter than in the male; eye-wattle a little 
paler than in the male. 

Young male. Eesembles the old female in the colour of the upper 
parts and in having more or loss maroon on the throat. As this gradually 
disappears the black pectoral band makes its appearance; thus 
specimens are met with in every change of plumage as regards the 
amount of rufous on the throat. Immature birds, however, may

always be told by the fulvous edgings to the wings and wing-coverts; 
the underparts are dusky white, the Hanks conspicuously groyish.

Nestling. General colour above mottled, the feathers being yellowish 
buff edged with blackish brown; wings dark brown, the 
coverts spotted with buff in the centre, the greater series and the 
secondaries rather broadly edged with fulvous -brown; lores and 
feathers over the eye fulvescent; sides of face brown, with yellowish-

Tho young birds appear to gain their full plumage before leaving 

152 
MUSCICAPIDiE. 

Elirope, as a specimen killed in August has nearly completed Lis 
adult dress, only a few remains of mottled plumage being apparent. 
The young, when their feathers are fully moulted, do not appear to 
differ in any way from the adults. The distinctness of the stripes 
on the breast is a character that varies a good deal, and some specimens 
are more rufescent in colour than others ; these may be the 
newly moulted birds. 

Adult. General colour brown, the forehead and crown of the head 
broadly streaked with dark-brown centres'to the feathers; wing-
coverts brown, with whity-brown edges to the wing-coverts and 
secondaries; the primaries and primary-coverts dark brown, narrowly 
margined with paler brown ; tail dark brown, with lighter brown 
edges to tbe feathers; lores and feathers in front of the eye dull 
whitish; round the eye a ring of bufTy whitish feathers ; ear-coverts 
brown; cheeks dull white, longitudinally streaked with light brown, 
broader on the sides of the throat, and forming an ill-defined malar 
streak; rest of under surface of body dull white, purer on the centre 
of the abdomen, the chest shaded with light brown and narrowly 
streaked with darker brown, these streaks becoming nearly obsolete 
on the lower breast and flanks, the latter being more uniform like 
the sides of the breast; thighs light brown ; under tail-coverts white ; 
under wing-coverts orange-brown, shaded with darker brown in the 
centre of the feathers; quills ashy brown below, dull buffy white 
along the inner webs ; bill brown, paler at base of lower mandible; 
feet black ; iris dusky brown. Total length 5-4 inches, culmen 0*55, 
wing 3-4, tail 2*45, tarsus 0*6.

Adult (type of species). General colour above uniform blue-grey, 
the forehead and crown slightly mottled with blackish centres to tho 
feathers, the upper tail-coverts browner with blue-grey margins; 
wings black, the wing-coverts broadly edged with blue-grey, the 
secondaries with ashy grey, paler at the tips of the feathers; primary-
coverts and primaries uniform blackish brown; tail-feathers datk 
brown, edged with grey near the base, and very slightly tipped with

with bro wn edgings along the inner webs; bill dark brown, the lower 
mandible lighter. Total length 5*5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2*85, 
tail 2-35, tarsus 0*55. 

Obs. In 1859 the late Mr. Cassin noticed a species of Flycatcher 
from the Gamma, but was unable to determine it. This he did, no 
doubt, advisedly, knowing the difficulty in identifying the species of 
this genus; but Mr. Heine, without ever seeing the bird, gave a name 

M 2 

156 
MtrscrrAPiD-i:. 

to it fiom the description of Mr. Ca&sin*. The latter is copied out 
below, and 1 am unable to identify the species; the black bill suggests 
the probability of its being the same as M. litr/ens, but then the 
under wing-coverts are described as " ashy white," which is like 21. 
c milescens. The type will have to be re-examined, as the description 
is vague.

Ohs. A specimen labelled female from Tasmania, and obtained by 
the Antarctic Expedition, is exactly like the male, and is probably 
wrongly determined, as the sexes seem to differ in colour throughout 
this entire genus. A female from Western Australia (King George 
Sound) differs from all the eastern birds in its extremely narrow 
white forehead, and may probably indicate a second species.

* P. modesta. The habitat of this species is given by Mr. Gould as " New 
Holland;" and if this locality had been correct, the name would have probably 
taken precedence over my name of P. leggii. It appears, however, that 
an error in the locality had taken place, as Mr. (3-ould subsequently, in both his 
later works, refers his Petroica modesta to the Norfolk-Island Hobin, and translates 
his Latin diagnosis of P. modesta for the female of the latter bird.

* The Crimson-bellied Flycatcher of Latham (Gen. Syn. Suppl. p. 221, pi. 
134) would seem to represent a species of the section Erythrodryas, perhaps 
Petrceca rosea, but it is impossible to make out the species for certain. A male 
of the latter bird in incomplete dress, and retaining portions of the female 
plumage, might answer to it; but the absence of the black throat and of the 
white spot on the forehead prevent its being recognized as any of the species 
known up to the present time. Its synonymy is as follows:—

Petroica forsfceri, Gray, Cat. B. Trop. Is!. Pacific Ocean, p. 15. 
Hab. Isle of Pines, New Caledonia. 
This bird is mentioned here merely for the purpose of showing that it is a myth. 

Mr. Gray refers as a synonym the name of Turdus minutus, Forster (Descr. 
Anim. p. 84), but this, from the figure and description, is Petroeea rnacrocephala 
of New Zealand. At page 257 of the same work, Forster casually mentions 
having observed Turdus minutus on Spruce-Tree Island, New Caledonia ,* and 
this is apparently Mr. Gray's authority for naming the species Petroica forsteri, 
on the chance of its turning up in the locality. Should a Petrozca occur in New 
Caledonia, it would very likely be P. similis of the New Hebrides.

secondaries. Total length 4*9 inches, eulrnen 0*5, wing 2-8, tail 2*1, 
tarsus 0*8. 

Adult female. Different from the male. General colour above 
sooty brown, the wings rather darker than the back, and exhibiting 
a white speculum, formed by a white band across the inner secondaries 
at about one third of the distance from the base; on some of 
the inner primaries an indistinct mark of brown on the outer web; 
across the rump an indication of a buff-coloured band; upper tail-
coverts black; tail-feathers black, with a quadrate spot of white on 
the inner web of the third feather, the penultimate one with a broad 
band of white extending obliquely across both webs, and much 
larger on. the outermost, which is obliquely white across the central 
half; on the forehead a large white spot; ear-coverts and feathers 
below the eye black with white shark-lines; under surface of body 
yellowish, the throat whiter, washed on the sides with blackish; 
thighs blackish; under wing-coverts white with black bases; quills 
blackish, white at the base of the secondaries. Total length 5*2 
inches, culmen 0*5, wing 2-9, tail 2*3, tarsus 1. 

Young. In the young of both sexes the yellow is reduced to a 
scarcely perceptible tinge, and in some examples is altogether wanting. 
In the young male the breast is obscurely mottled with brown, and 
in the young female these markings extend to the flanks also.

Pratincola jamesoni, Hume, Str. F. 1877, p. 239 (nom. emend.). 

Adult male. A broad stripe over the eyes and over the greater 
portion of the ear-coverts white, with a slight buffy tinge; lower 
part of the lores dusky ; chin, throat, and entire lower parts, including 
lower tail-coverts and tibial plumes, white with a yellowish 
tinge, and a very feeble rufescent tinge on breast and flanks; wing-
lining and axillaries pure white, the former slightly mottled with 
dusky; forehead, crown, occiput, nape, back, and scapulars light 
sandy buff, striated longitudinally with hair-brown; rump and upper 
tail-coverts white, most of the feathers tinged towards their tips 
with pale rusty buff; primaries and secondaries hair-brown, margined 
on the outer webs with light buff and tipped with yellowish 
white, the primaries more narrowly, the secondaries more broadly; 
tertiary greater coverts, or, perhaps I should call them, lower scapulars, 
white ; tertiaries and greater and median secondary coverts 
deep brown, broadly margined with pale, more or less rufescent 
buff; entire visible portion of lesser coverts pale sandy buff; edge 
of wing and outer webs of earlier greater primary-coverts pure 
white; tail hair-brown, all the feathers margined on the outer 
webs with sandy buff or light yellowish brown, the outer web of 
the outermost feather almost entirely of this colour; all the feathers, 

except the central pair, with almost the entire inner webs white ; 
the outermost pair have an irregular subterminal brown band from 
0*2 to 0*3 inch wide on this web, but the rest have only a small 
patch of brown near the shaft close to the tip, the pair next the 
centre having the patch rather larger: there are traces of a dark 
streak from the base of the lower mandible down either side of the 
throat, expanding on the sides of the breast; doubtless in breeding-
plumage this streak and patch are black or blackish: " bill and feet 
black; iris brown." Total length 6 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 3, 
tail 2-12, tarsus 0*97. (Hume.) 

Breeding-plumage. Two or three of both my males and females 
have the lower parts of the lores, cheeks, ear-coverts, and entire 
sides of the throat (leaving only a narrow pure white stripe down 
the centre of the throat) black, the feathers only a little tipped 
with pale sandy, which doubtless in the breeding-season entirely 
disappears; also the lesser and median and the secondary greater 
wing-coverts and the winglet have become nearly black, only very 
narrowly edged with sandy buff, which colour also seems in the 
course of disappearing. (Hume.) 

Adult female in winter plumage. Similar to the male but smaller, 

12. PRATINCOLA.

Adult male in breeding-jplnmage. General colour above jet-black, 
with more or less distinct remains of sandy-brown edgings to 
the feathers, especially on the scapulars; upper tail-coverts "white 
with subterminal spots of black, the tips being also slightly shaded 
with sandy buff; wings black, with remains of whitish edgings on 
the greater coverts and at the tips of the secondaries, the latter 
being also margined with sandy brown; a large shoulder-patch of 
white, formed by the innermost median and greater coverts and the 
bases to the inner secondaries; tail dark brown, with edgings and 
tips of sandy brown on all the feathers, particularly the outermost, 
which has a narrow sandy-brown margin along the outer web; 
sides of face, ear-coverts, and entire throat black, with obsolete 
remains of sandy margins; fore neck and entire breast orange-
rufous ; the feathers on the sides of the breast white with rufous 
tips ; on the sides of the neck a large patch of white, reaching in a 
triangular form to the edge of the throat; rest of under surface 
buffy white, the flanks wasbed with orange-rufous; under wing-
coverts and axillaries white with black bases; quills blackish brown 
below, white along the edge of the inner web. Bill and legs black; 

iris dark brown. Total length 4*5 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 2*6, 
tail 1*9, tarsus 0*9. 

Adidt male in ivinter plumage. Differs from the summer plumage 
in being sandy brown above; the black feathers of the upper surface 
being very broadly edged with this colour, and producing a mottled 
appearance where the black bases to the feathers show through; 
wings black, all the feathers plainly edged with sandy brown, 
inclining to buffy white at the tips of the median, greater, and 
primary coverts and of the secondary quills; upper tail-coverts 
rufous, with concealed white bases and distinct subterminal spots 
of black; tail-feathers dark brown, edged with sandy brown and 
distinctly tipped with fulvous; black feathers on the sides of the 
face and throat obscured by broad margins of sandy buff; the white 
feathers on the sides of the neck scarcely distinguishable, and 
obscured by broad tips of sandy rufous; the white feathers on the 
sides of the upper breast with a tip of dusky brown to each; rufous 
feathers of the breast and flanks edged with sandy buff, the abdomen 
and the under tail-coverts being of the latter colour. 

Obs. The summer plumage is gained by the wearing away of the 
light edgings to the feathers, and not by a distinct moult. 

Adult female. General colour above sandy brown, with dark brown 
centres to the feathers, producing a mottled appearance; the upper 

12. PJUTI.N0OH, 
tail-coverts rufescent, with concealed while marks about the middle 
of the feathers, which are longitudinally streaked towards the tip 
with blackish brown ; wings blackish brown with broad sandycoloured 
margins ; the white wing-patch smaller than in the male, 
but formed in the same manner; tail-feathers dark brown, edged 
with sandy buff, more distinct on the outermost feather, all of them 
having sandy-buff tips; lores and an indistinct eyebrow fulvous; 
ear-coverts darker brown, streaked with fulvous; throat ashy buff, 
with concealed blackish bases to the feathers, and an indistinct spot 
of black on the lower throat, on each side of the latter a triangular 
patch of white running up behind the ear-coverts; fore neck, breast, 
and sides of body pale orange-rufous; abdomen, thighs, and under 
tail-coverts sandy buff; under wing-coverts and axillaries white 
with blackish bases ; quills dusky brown below, edged with white 
along the inner web. Total length 5 inches, culmen 0-5, wing 2*5, 
tail 1*9, tarsus 0-85. 

The winter plumage of the female does not differ much from the 
summer dress, excepting that the general tone of coloration is 
browner, the feathers of the upper surface being more broadly edged 
with brown; the throat is entirely ashy buff, the black jugular 
spot, as well as the white on the sides of the neck, being completely 

obscured. 

Young. Mottled; general colour above blackish brown, with grey 
bases to the feathers, each of which has a triangular spot of buff 
near the tip; head streaked with the latter colour; rump and upper 
tail-coverts rufescent, mottled with brown edgings to the feathers ; 
wings dark brown, with broad rufescent margins to the wing-coverts 
and quills ; tail-feathers dark brown, edged and tipped with sandy 
rufous, broader on the outermost feather; lores dull whitish with 
fulvous tips; round the eye a ring of buff feathers; ear-coverts 
dark brown streaked with fulvous; cheeks and throat ashy fulvous, 
the latter slightly mottled with brown tips; rest of under surface 
pale rufous-buff; fore neck and breast mottled with brown tips to 
the feathers. 

Hah. Europe, extending into Palestine and eastwards into Russia, 
its range coalescing with that of P. maura probably somewhere in 
the watershed of the Yolga river, perhaps between that river and 
the Don.

Adult male. General colour above glossy black, including the

patch composed of the innermost of the least, median, and greater 
wing-coverts, as well as the adjoining outer greater coverts, which are 
white on the inner web, and the bases of the inner secondaries, which 
are white; rump and upper tail-coverts pure white; tail-feathers, a 
few of the feathers white at the extreme base ; sides of the face, 
sides of neck, and entire under surface glossy black, the vent and 
under tail-coverfcs white; some of the feathers of the lower abdomen 
and the thighs with obscure white edgings ; under wing-coverts and 
axillaries black, a few narrowly edged with white ; quills black below; 
"bill aud feet black; iris dark brown" {A. Everett). Total 
length 5*4 inches, culm en 0-45, wing 2*6, tail 2*1, tarsus 0*8. 

The younger males appear to be some time in gaining the full 
black plumage and remain for some little while with the entire abdomen 
white, instead of having only the vent and under tail-coverts 
white; along with this white abdomen is sometimes found a broad 
white edging to the under wing-coverts, and occasionally some of 
the primaries are externally margined with white. 

Adult female. Quite different in plumage to the male. Above 
ashy brown, with darker brown centres to the feathers of the head, 
scapulars, and back ; lower rump and upper tail-coverts buffy white, 
somewhat washed with rust-colour, the long tail-coverts tipped with 
this latter colour; tail-feathers dark brown; wing-coverts and 
quills dark brown margined with lighter brown, much paler on the 
edges of the primaries; feathers in front of the eye and eyebrow 
ashy; ear-coverts dark brown, as also the feathers under the eye ; 
cheeks and under surface of body brown, the chin and fore part of 
cheeks margined with whity brown, the breast slightly mottled with 
darker brown centres to the feathers; the abdomen inclining to 
ochraceous brown; under tail-coverts white ; under wing-coverts 
rather rufescent brown with an ashy shade; quills brown below, 
shaded lighter along the inner webs. Total length 5*4 inches, 

culmen 0*45, wing 2*75, tail 2*1, tarsus 0*8. 

Young. Mottled all over like a young Bobin," the upper surface 
being fulvescent, edged with darker brown; the head blackish brown, 
streaked down the centre of the feathers with deep fulvous • wing-
coverts and quills edged with fawn-colour; under surface of body 
fulvous, slightly varied with dark edges to the feathers of the breast. 

This species appears to have a winter plumage, when the black 
feathers are edged with rusty ochre. 


Obs. Individuals from the Neilgherries and Ceylon have been kept 
distinct by many ornithologists on account of their larger size. Mr. 
Hume writes (Str. E. 1873, p. 183):—" I very much doubt the 
propriety of retaining P. atrata, Blyth, as a distinct species. All 
that can be said is, that the Forthern-Indian specimens of P. 
coprata are generally smallest, Central-Indian, Goojerat, and Sindh 
birds intermediate, and Southern-Indian and Ceylon birds largest. 
Those who think the larger size a sufficient specific character must 
separate the Celyonese bird as Pratincola atrata or P. bicolor, Sykes." 
A considerable difference exists in the amount of white on the 

12. PR1TINC0LA.. 
under surface in this species, the majority of the specimens from 
the Eastern archipelago having the whito confined to the under tail-
coverts, while nearly all the individuals from the N.W. Himalayas 
and from Baluchistan have the lower breast and abdomen while as 
well as the under tail-coverts. These differences would seem to be 
specific, were it not that occasional specimens were met with from 
one or other of tho above-named localities showing partially the 
characters of the opposite race.

* That P. semitorqiiata is only the adult breeding-plumage of P. aZbofaseiata 
is proved by a comparison of one of the typical specimens of the latter bird in 
the Museum with the birds figured by Mr. Blanford (I. c). Some mistake 
seems to have occurred in the figure given in Dr. Eiippell's work, where the 
white neck-spot has become merged in the white wing-band, which is represented 
as much too extensive; this may be seen by a comparison of the plates 
in the above-mentioned works.

creasing in extent towards the outermost; least wing-coverts slaty 

grey like the mantle; median and greater coverts pure white, the 

outermost and bastard wing slaty grey; primary-coverts and pri


maries dark brown, narrowly margined with slaty brown, the inner 

secondaries broadly edged with greyish white; ear-coverts, sides of 

face, and sides of neck slaty grey, rather blacker on the cheeks ; 

behind the eye a small longitudinal mark of white feathers; entire 

throat and breast deep orange, fading off into orange-yellow on the 

flanks; lower abdomen and under tail-covcrts white; thighs slaty 

grey; axillaries orange like the breast; under wing-coverts white, 

the edge of the wing mottled with greyish bases to the feathers ; 

quills brown below, ashy whitish along the inner web ; " bill black ; 

feet brown; iris black" {David). Total length 4*7 inches, culmen 

0-4, wing 3, tail 2*1, tarsus 0*6. 

Obs. The description is taken from the Katuna-Island specimen 

mentioned below. Other specimens of adult males are very similar, 

but vary in the extent of black pervading the upper surface, which 

extends over the cheeks and sides of the neck, and also over the 

least wing-coverts. The specimens which exhibit these peculiarities 

are chiefly Bornean, and they may probably be putting on their full 

plumage before returning from their winter quarters; they are more 

richly coloured than Japanese or Chinese specimens in the collection 

of the Museum and of Sir. Seebohm. 

Adult female. Different from the male. General colour above 

olive-brown, lighter on the rump, where it is yellower ; upper tail-

coverts blackish ; tail brown, white at the base of the outer webs of 

the feathers; least wing-coverts olive like the back; remainder of 

the coverts brown, edged with olive, the greater series tipped with 

white; primary-coverts and quills brown, narrowly edged with 

olive, the inner secondaries with white; lores yellowish buff; round 

the eye a ring of buffy-white feathers ; ear-coverts olive, with nar


row whitish shaft-lines; cheeks slightly shaded with grey; under 

surface of body as in the male, but not so deep orange. Total length 

4*5 inches, wing 0*4, tail 2-9, tarsus 0-6. (MKS. H. Seebohm.) 

Young male. In general like the adult female, but much paler 

orange on the breast, with two buffy-white bars across the wing, 

composed of the tips to the median and greater coverts; sides of 

face grey, the cheeks more or less blackish ; tail-feathers broadly 

white at base of outer web. 

-Young female. Like the young male, but with no white at the 

base of the tail-feathers.

The female described was presented to the Museum by Mr. 
Mandelli, who collected it in April 1874. Another female, also obtained 
by Mr. Mandelli in October 1873, and presented by that 
gentleman, appears to be in winter plumage, as it differs from the 
bird described in its more pronounced olive-brown coloration, which 
shades off very perceptibly to fulvous brown on the rump, and to 
rufous on the upper tail-coverts and tail• below, the under surface 
is purer white, with less ashy on the sides of the breast and flanks.

however, be due to the bad preparation and shifting of the feathers!

Obs. Mr. Ramsay speaks of having seen a good many specimens 
of this supposed new species. Mr. Godman's collection contains a 
single example, which has the loral spot white, with the eye-ring only 
tinged with rufous, which also pervades the checks and chin. This 
would seem to indicate that the rufous tingo is a sign of immaturity ; 
and the species is certainly doubtful.

Seebohm.) 

Ohs. As in the case of the allied Indian species, T. rujilatus, it is 
evident that the male of T. cyanurus takes some time to gain the 
adult dress : and that it breeds in the female plumage is shown b\ 
Mr. Seebohm's specimens obtained on the Yen-e-say Eiver at the end 
of May; both are dissected males. Pallas was partly aware of the 
fact, for he says that the males and females are alike in plumage; 
but states that he also, on two occasions, procured brighter blue 
birds, which he found very rare, and considered to be a variety. 
Mr. Seebohm's males, kiEed in May and June 1877, are in a dress 
resembling that of the female, but rather more ashy brown above 
and purer white below, the sides of the breast greyish brown ; the 
flanks are brighter orange, and the white loral streaks are very distinctly 
indicated; the quills are edged with olive-browii instead of 
rufous-olive.

(Cassin, I. c.) 

Plab. Gaboon. 

Obs. I have placed the present species in the genus Lioptilus 

solely from Mr. Cassin's description, as the type still remains unique 
in Philadelphia. He describes it as of the same general form as 
Parisoma melanurum ( = P. plumbeum, Hartl.), but with the bill 
stronger, and the colours of the plumage entirely different. This 
thicker bill and the pale-coloured legs most likely belong to a Lioptilus, 
as the South-African species (L. nigricapillus) differs from a 
Parisoma chiefly in these two characteristics ; indeed it is doubtful 
whether Lioptilus should be considered more than a thick-billed 
Parisoma.

Adult male. General colour above azure-blue, rather greyer on the 
rump; wing-coverts like the back, the quills dusky blackish externally, 
edged with dull azure-blue, the inner secondaries entirely of 
the latter colour; tail-feathers dusky blackish, dull blue on the 
outer webs, with a narrow line of white at the tips, these white 
tips sometimes nearly obsolete; crown of head and sides of head 
lighter azure-blue, the feathers with a velvety texture; a frontal 
line and a square patch on the nape black; chin black; sides of face 
and throat and fore neck light azure-blue, with a band of black 
across the latter; rest of under surface white, washed with greyish 
blue on the sides of the body and thighs ; under wing-coverts white, 
slightly shaded with grey ; quills blackish below, broadly edged with 
white along the inner web ; " bill dark blue, edges and tip black; 
inside of mouth yellow; legs plumbeous, claws homy; iris dark

brown; edges of eyelids blue, eyelids plumbeous " (Oates). Total 
length 5*8 inches, culmen 0-55, wing 2*8, tail 2*85, tarsus 0*7. 

Adult female. Different from the male. General colour above 
light earthy brown, the wing-coverts and scapulars slightly washed 
with pale azure; quills light brown, externally edged with ashy, 
which has a pale azure shade; tail-feathers brown, with a blue 
shade on the edges of the feathers; head azure-blue, as also the 
throat and fore neck, the blue brighter on the crown and round the 
eye ; chest greyer ; rest of under surface of body white, as also the 
under wing-coverts and inner lining of the quills. Total length 
6*5 inches, wing 2*95, tail 3, tarsus 0*7. 

Ohs. The female bird above described is from Matheran, and 
seems large. A male from the same place has the wing 2-75, the 
tail 2-85 inches. The Pegu bird is more like the Malayan H. occipitalis, 
but has scarcely as much blue shade over the white belly as 
in typical examples; it is difficult to decide from a single bird, and 
Mr. Hume, who has had a large series before him, pronounces Pegu 
specimens to be identical with Indian.

a nuchal patch Hack; wing-coverts like the back ; quills and tail-

feathers blackish, externally washed with blue; sides of face and 

entire throat rich azure-blue, with a black collar across the fore 

neck ; rest of under surface greyish purple, overlying the dull white 

on the breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts; thighs purplish; 

under wing-coverts greyish purple overlying the white like the

blue; iris dark brown " (Everett)*. Total length 5'8 inches, culmen 

0-5, wing 2*7, tail 2-6, tarsus 0-6. 

Adult female. Differs from the male as does the female of E. 

azurea: i. e. it has the back brown, with the head dull azure, the 

black nape-spot being absent. It is of a darker brown than the 

female of H. azurea, and has the whitish abdomen overspread with 

a shade of bluish grey. 

06s. It will be a matter of opinion whether this is really a distinct 
species, or whether it should be considered merely a race of H. 
azurea. Specimens from the same locality vary considerably as 
regards the white on the abdomen; some of them have this part 
blue, but paler than the breast. Those which exhibit this character 
in tho most marked degree are the birds from the Andamans—Hy~ 
pothymis tytleri (Eeavan) ; but on this point see Mr. Hume's careful 
observations (S. P. 1874, p. 217). He finds that the majority of 
the Andaman birds are different from the Indian, but that occasionally 
they show more or less of an approach to the latter. This 
is exactly my experience with regard to the Indo-Malayan individuals 
; and certainly those from Plores are whiter below than usual; 
they also occasionally want the nape-spot and prsepectoral collar. 

I may here add a word as to my reason for applying the name of 
azurea to the Indian bird instead of to the Philippine, as Mitscicapa 
azurea, Bodd., is founded on the " Gobe-mouches bleu des Philippines 
" of Daubenton's plate. As the white belly is the character by 
which the two species are distinguished, and as this is shown clearly 
in the plate, I have adopted it, believing that the locality assigned 
is erroneous. The description mentions a slight shade of blue on the 
underparts; but this is also seen in the Indian bird. Those ornithologists 
who prefer the correctness of the locality to that of the 
drawing, must adopt the name of Ilypothymis cwruleocejphala (Sykes) 
for the Indian species.

Obs. The type of M. broivni in the Museum, scarcely equals in intensity 
the blood-red or crimson colouring of the Port-Essington and 
N.W.-Australian birds; and it seems that there may be possibly three 
species of red-backed Maluri, differing only in the intensity of the 
colouring of the back. The oldest name for the crimson-baeked 
species, the M. cruentatus of Gould, is certainly the Sylvia dorsalis 
of Lewin.

darker cinereous, and like them have the crest only black. The bill is larger and 
more depressed. I do not regard it a.s expedient to propose a new specific designation 
in this difficult family, without having adult specimens." (Cassin, I. c.) 

* Dr. Peters was so kind as to send me for examination the types of Dr. 
Reichenows' T. mgrimitrata ; and in th e absence of typical specimens of Trochocercus 
nifens, I was inclined to consider them quite a distinct species. During 
a recent visit, however, to IJeiden, I found several birds from the Gold Coast 
agreeing with Dr. Heichenow's specimens, and identified in that collection as 2\ 
nitens of Cassin. On re-examining the subject I consider this identification 
correct, and I also identify with the same species three specimens which 1 had 
before determined as the female of Terpsipione atrochalybea. At the same time 
I give a description of the types lent me by Dr. Peters, and should add that the 
woodcuts which accompany this article are drawn from the Berlin specimens. 
Male (type of species). General colour above slaty blue, as also an eyebrow, 
sides of head, and under surface of body ; the lower parts rather lighter 
and more greyish blue ; entire crown of head black, forming a cap ; least wing-
coverts slaty blue like the back, the remainder of the coverts and the quills dark 
sepia-brown, with a n obscure edging of slaty blue on some of the coverts and 
inner secondaries ; tail-feathers blackish ; bill'black ; feet blue; iris dark. Total 
length 55 inches, culmen 055, wing 2-55, tail 25, tarsus 07. (Mm. Berol.) 

Adult female. Differs from the in ale in being ashy blackish above, with a 
greenish gloss, the crown dusky black ; below ashy whitish, as also the lores and 
eyebrow; sides of face and neck ashy whitish, the ear-coverts dull blackish. 
fotal length 55 inches, culmen 0'55, wing 2'4, tail 25, tarsus 0'6.

male; back and other upper parts dark cinereous (without lustre); 

wings and tail ashy black. Entire underparts light cinereous, 

darker on the throat and breast, and very pale on the abdomen; 

under wing-coverts light ashy, nearly white. (Cassin, I. c.) 

Besides the three specimens in the British Museum, I lately 

observed four others in the Leiden collection, three males and a 

female. The latter answered to the description given by Cassin. 

The measurements were as follows:—Total length 5 inches, culmen 

0-55, wing 2-3, tail 2*75, tarsus 0*6.

Range. From India and Ceylon, through the Burmose countries 

to the Malayan peninsula, extending over the whole of the Malayan 

archipelago, Australia, and Oceania. 

Obs. Under this generic name several apparent subgenera are in


cluded, as they appear to have no certain characters by which Ihey 

could be easily told. Between such species as IL tricolor and 1L fitlj


(jinosa there is, at first sight, a great difference in the head, the former 

having a stout bill with comparatively few rictal bristles, while the 

latter has a weak bill with numerous rictal bristles surpassing iho 

bill in length. But between these two forms every possible grada


tion is found as regards the number of rictal bristles and strength of 

bill. I have therefore kept the species of Bhipidara in one genus 

containing sections not deemed worthy even of subgeneric separation.

Ehipidura ochracea, Gray, Gen. B. i. p. 258; id. Hand-l. B. i. p. 332,

A species said to have been found at the Cape of G-ood Hope, but certainly 
not a Muscicapine bird. Prof. Sunclevall thinks that it may be intended for a, 
young Promerops coffer of which the bill has been broken. It looks something 
like a badfigure of a Crateropus. 

t The forms included in this genus are so varied that it has been found very 
difficult to construct a diagnostic table which should represent them in their 
natural order. The present arrangement in the key is somewhat artificial, and 
is written with a view to the easy deciphering of the species.

Obs. On comparing the Salwati specimen with another from Banda 
collected by Mr, Wallace, a difference in the forehead is observable. 
The Banda bird, true B. squamata of Muller, has a broad black forehead, 
with a small spot of white above the fore part of the eye. In 
the !N"ew-Gruinea individual the forehead is white, extending backwards 
over the eye. The type of R. griseicauda, from "Waigiou, however, 
kindly lent me by Count Salvadori, shows the frontal plumes 
brown with white tips j and as it appears a somewhat changeable

both by Professor Schlegel and Count Salvador!. I believe 
that it is the young of the latter, notwithstanding its uniform breast. 
The colouring of the breast varies from chocolate-brown with white 
spots to greyish black and entirely black, and the number and size 
of the spots also varies greatly, becoming apparently fewer and at 
the same time larger with age. 

Hob. New Guinea and island of Jobi. 

* This species is not included in Count Salvadori's * tfccelli di Borneo;' but 
Captain Elwes possesses a specimen said to be from that island.

Adult male (type of species). General colour above dull blackish 
brown, the crown of head, rump, and upper tail-coverts blacker; 
wing-coverts slaty black, all minutely tipped with white; quills 
blackish brown; tail-feathers black, tipped with white, increasing 
in extent towards the outermost; sides of face black ; from the base 
of the bill a distinct streak of white above the eye; chin, a broad 
moustache running down and widening out on the sides of the 
throat, white; centre of throat and under surface of body black, 
rather more ashy on the abdomen; feathers of the fore neck and 
chest subterminally spotted with white; under tail-coverts black, 
tipped with white ; under wing-coverts and axillarics blackish, 
broadly edged with white; quills brown below, washed with ashy 
on the edge of the inner webs; " bill black, the lower mandible 
white; feet black" (Wallace). Total length 7*7 inches, culmen 
0-6, wing 3-1, tail 4*0, tarsus 0*9. 

Adult female. Similar to the male. Total length 7*2 inches, 
wing 2-8, tail 3*5, tarsus 0-8. 
Ohs. New-Guinea birds have larger and more numerous white 
spots on the chest than those from the Aru Islands. 

Young female (type of B. saturata). General colour above sooty 
black, becoming deeper black on the rump and upper tail-coverts; 
wings rather browner than the back; tail black, all but the two 
centre feathers broadly tipped with white; above the eye a 
white streak; lores and sides of face black; chin and sides of 
throat white, with black tips to many of the feathers; centre 
of throat and remainder of under surface of body sooty brown, 
deepening into black on the under tail-coverts; the breast-feathers 
on being parted show concealed spots of white; under wing-
coverts blackish, broadly tipped with white; quills ashy blackish 
below. Total length 6-8 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2*8, tail 3*9, 
tarsus 0*85. (Mus. Lugd.) 

Ohs, I have examined the type of R. saturata in the Leiden 
Museum. On moving the breast-feathers spots of white are plainly 
to be seen, and I believe it to be only the young bird of B. maculi


pectus. The bill has a blackish spot at the tip of the otherwise 
white under mandible; and this I take also to be a sign of youth.

washed with rufous on the lower back; least wing-coverts like the 
back; median and greater series and quills dark brown, edged and 
tipped with pale rufous-buff, the primaries obsoletely margined; tail

feathers tipped with white; crown of head, sides of face, and ear-
coverts ashy black; the fore part of the cheeks and chin also black; 
over the eye a line of white ; entire throat white, extending upon the 
sides of the neck; across the fore neck a band of black, washed 
with grey on the sides; remainder of under surface yellowish white, 
deepening into light fawn-colour on ihe abdomen and under tail-
coverts ; thigh-feathers brown, edged with fawn-colour; sides of 
body brown ; under wing-coverts white; axillaries dark brown, with 
fawn-coloured edgings; quills brown below, with ashy edges to the 
inner webs. Total length 7*2 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2*85, tail 3*5, 
tarsus 0*75. 


Young. Browner than the adults, the feathers of the upper surface 
obscurely edged with rufous, the wing-coverts tipped with dull 
rufous; eye-streak very indistinct; band across the fore neck 
browner than in the adult. 


Obs. Bhipidura longicauda of Wallace is this species, and is 
apparently only the adult male. The latter sex I am unable to 
describe with certainty, not one of the series in the British Museum 
being determined by dissection. Mr. Wallace describes B. longicauda 
as "very near B.javanica, from which it differs iu the longer tail, 
narrower white tips to only three outer tail-feathers, and the black 


^chin." Having not only Mr. Wallace's series, but a much larger 
one besides in the Museum from Labuan, I am able to state positively 
that these differences are not specific. There is an example 
from Labuan exactly agreeing with the type of It longicauda, and 
it is evidently of the same species as the other Labuan birds, which 
again agree with Javan examples of It. javaniea. At the same time 

B. longicauda is probably the old male, as it is darker than the 
female described, has the head blacker, the hind neck washed with 
slaty grey, the eyebrow very distinct, the under surface white with 
a slight tinge of fawn-colour, the chin with a very little black, the 
collar on the throat intensely black, except at the sides, which are 
slaty grey, the lateral breast-feathers mottled, half black and half 
white : total length 7*5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 3*25, tail 4*1, 
tarsus 0*9. The breadth of the tips to the tail-feathers varies 
greatly, as does also the amount of black on the chin, which depends 
very much on the way in which the skin is prepared. 
llab. Indo-Chinese countries, Tenasserim, and Cochin China, 
ranging down the Malayan peninsula to the Sunda Islands.

Obs. Tbe description is taken from a South-Australian specimen 
o£H. motacHloldes ; and between this and i?. melanohitca there seems 
to be absolutely no difference except that of size. Mr. Gould bus 
described a third form, R. picata, from ^Tortb Australia^ which forms 
a smaller race. I propose to keep these birds under one specific 
name , separating them in the list of specimens according to locality, 
and I give the length of the wing in each case. It will be seen that 
th e specimens of B. motacilhides have the wing ranging from *S~($5 
to 3"95 inches, B. picata 8*45 to 3*76, JR. melanoleuca 3'il to 4*25. In 
face of these fkcts, how can three species be recognized? Tbe extent 
of the black on the throat varies, and is apparently influenced by 
the preparation of the skin; and there is great difference in tbe distinctness 
of the white eyebrow and of the white edgings to the 
cheek-£»lumes, even in skins from the same locality.

* Cuvier's genus Muscivora was a composite one, and intended to embrace not 
only some broad-billed Flycatchers of the Old World, but also some of the New-
World Tyrant-Flycatchers. Muscipeta of Cuvier, 1817, was intended by him to 
replace his Muscivora of 1799; but the name could not then be used, as it was 
preoccupied by Muscipeta of Koch, 1816, proposed for the Reed-Warblers of 
Europe. Muscivora is now restricted to the Crested Tyrants of the New World 
(M. regia, &c.); and it is therefore quite proper to employ the name Terpsiphone 
of G-loger for the Paradise Flycatchers, which formed the Old-World, 
section of Cuvier's original genus Muscivora.

Ohs. The changes of plumage in this species are not understood by 
naturalists, and Br. Jerdon Q. c.) alludes to the different opinions 
entertained by Indian observers on the subject. From the series of 
skins in the Museum, I should suggest that the sequence of plumage 
would be as follows, and that the differences of plumage can all be 

2 A 2 

348 
MITSCICAPID.a3. 

accounted for by age and not by season of the year. Unfortunately, 
very few of the skins examined by me have the sex and date of capture 
attached, and so, even if my idea of the sequence is correct, I 
am unable to form an estimate of the time it -would take for a male 
bird to acquire the adult white plumage. 

The nestling described above shows the first dress, which may be 

described as dull chestnut with a whitish belly. 
The adult female is also described. 
The male at first resembles the old female, "but has the glossy 

crown and crest, as well as the throat, steel-green; rest of under 
surface white; tail rufous, longer than in the old female. 

The next dress is like the foregoing, but with a long red tail, and 
with the quills and primary-coverts edged with white, only the inner 
secondaries being rufous like the back. Erom the perfect character 
of this plumage, as well as from the number of specimens which 
exhibit it, it would appear to be the full breeding-plumage of the 
male at some period or other, probably in the second year. 

At the same time this and the preceding stage of plumage may 
be of the same period in the bird's life, as there is one specimen before 
me now with the white centre tail-feathers full-grown, and a 
few white feathers coming in the centre of the back, while the wings 
are still rufous. 

In the red-tailed stage, when the long red centre tail-feathers are 
worn along with the metallic head and throat, the specimens from 
South-eastern India and Ceylon differ from those from Northern and 
North-western India in having the chest and sides of the body grey 
and not white. 

The change from the red to the full white plumage seems to be accomplished 
partly by a change of feather, and partly by a direct 
moult.

Adult female. Above deep chestnut, the tail entirely of the latter 
colour ; wing-coverts uniform with the back; primary-coverts dusky 
brown; quills blackish, externally chestnut; head above, sides of 
face, and throat dusky steel-green; chest ashy grey ; rest of under

tail 3*35, tarsus 0*65. (11MS. IL SeeboJim.) 

Young males in nearly full plumage, with long red tails, are deeper 
chestnut than the adult females, and generally have a slight indication 
of maroon on the mantle. They have almost the entire under 
surface grey, with a little white about the lower abdomen and vent. 
The throat, if not exactly like the adult, is deep slate-colour, with 
a strong wash of steel-green. 

Mr. Swinhoe had a bird from Mngpo in full white plumage, which 
he has labelled T. incil. As far as I can see, this species never 
passes beyond the maroon-backed dress with the red tail, and the 
above-mentioned white bird I should refer to T. affinis. Messrs. 
David and Oustalet, however, also figure the adult of this species as 
white.

Adult female. General colour above orange-rufous, the tail 
entirely of this colour; wing-coverts like the back; primary-coverts 
and quills blackish, externally orange-rufous, the secondaries more 
broadly edged and the innermost exactly like the back; crown of 
head and nape glossy steel-blue ; lores, feathers round the eye, ear-
coverts, and sides of crown beMnd ashy grey; entire under surface 
of body rich orange-rufous, paler than the back, including the wider 
wing- and tail-coverts; quills dusky brown below, rufous along the 
inner webs. Total length 6'5 inches, culmen 0% wing 2*9, tail 
3-25, tarsus 0*6. 
Young male. Resembles the adult female, but shows the first signs 
of approach to a fuller plumage in the white edgings to some of the 
greater wing-coverts. The next stage is a rich chestnut., with steel-
black head and ear-coverts, the wing-coverts and edges to the quills 
white. One specimen in the-^fSH^um is fumin g the wMte tail, 
the two long centre feathers being black on &e^a&£jejt>, white on 
tjie inner. That the exact sequence is not always followed seems 
to be proved by the fact that another specimen, in paler orange 
dress, with white-edged wing-feathers, is assuming the full white 
dress of the adult by a moult, as on the back are some Hack feathers 


* The type specimen was shown to me by Br. Finsch, and there can be no 
doubt that it is referable to T. mutata. At the same time I do not believe that 
this species really occurs in Eastern Africa, and I think that some mistake has 
taken place as regards the locality of the specimen, which was pre&erved HI spirits, 
whereas Speke's specimens from Eastern Africa were skinned.

appearing, and on the "breast some white ones. In the penultimate 
plumage the back is glossy black, the breast white, the centre tail-
feathers white, tho rest of the tail-feathers black with the inner 
webs white. Prom this stage the white gradually increases on the 
back, wings, and tail, until the following adult plumage is reached. 

Adult male. General colour above white, the feathers with moro 
or less distinct black centres, gonerally taking the form of black 
shaft-lines; wing-coverts white, like tho back; primary-coverts 
and primaries black narrowly edged with white, the secondaries 
broadly margined with white on the outer web ; tail white, the two 
centre feathers with black shafts nearly the whole way, the rest ot 
the tail-feathers with more or less black along the shaft and on the 
outer web; crown of head, crest, nape, sides of head, and throat 
glossy steel-green; remainder of under surface pure white, including 
the under wing-coverts ; quills blackish below, white along the edge

The only species of Terpsiphone which answers to this description of dark grey 
under tail-coverts is T. melanogastra^ which at certain htages agrees with 
Brisson's description. I have therefore superseded Swarason's name by the one 
founded by Gfanelin upon Brisson. The species identified by Dr. Hartlaub as 

T. cristata (<3m) and by me as T. senegalensis (Less.) appears to have not yet 
been named.

Difficult as it is to establish, I havo come to the COB elusion that 
Terpsiphone melampyra is only the female of the species of which 

T. dmhaillui is the adult male. The Museum series is so complete 
that scarcely any doubt can exist on the subject, and the sequence 
of changes appears to be as follows ;— 
Young female (sex marked by Dr. Lucan). Above dull orange-
chestnut, including the tail; wing-coverts like the back, the greater 
series with blackish bases ; primary-coverts and quills blackish, the 
secondaries externally orange-rufous, of which a narrow margin 
appears on the primaries; head and under surface of body dull slaty 
blue with a slight steel-bluish lustre, the abdomen fluffy and dull 
whitish, washed slightly with orange; vent and under tail-coverts 
dull orange; thighs dusky grey; under wing-coverts slaty grey; 
axillaries dull orange-rufous. Total length 6 inches, culmen 0*6, 
wing 2*8, tail 2*8, tarsus 0*55. 

The bird I take to be thefull-plumaged female is much as the typical 
specimen of T. melampyra, Eich orange-chestnut above ; wings and 
tail the same, the secondaries entirely like the back, the primaries with 
broad edgings; below slaty blue, the throat and sides of face glossed 
with steel-blue; the hind neck greyish*. crown of head glossy steel-
blue ; under wing-coverts slaty blue; under tail-coverts orange. 

Young males appear at first to resemble the females, but are often 
distinguished by the greyish edgings to the primaries and the long 
centre tail-feathers. Considerable difference in the colour of the 
upperparts exists, sometimes the back being bright orange-rufous, 
and sometimes chestnut. 

Male in second plumage, The head, neck, and underparts very like 
the adult, steel-green, shading off into slaty grey on the abdomen; rest 
of upper surface rich chestnut-red, as also the wing-coverts; outer 
greater coverts, primary-coverts, and quills black, externally edged 
with slaty grey, the inner secondaries with chestnut; tail chestnut; 
under tail-coverts chestnut. Total length 8*3 inches, culmen 0*65, 
wing 3*1, tail 3*6, middle tail-feathers 5, tarsus 0*6. 

Intermediate specimens between the red-backed and the white-
backed phases of plumage are in the collection; one may be especially 
mentioned, as having the red back with a good deal of white 
on the wings, and a black tail somewhat shaded with rufous at the 
tip of the inner web, the centre feather having an appearance of 
white near the shaft. The question to be proved is, whether the 
adult male ever gets a perfectly whito tail, and whether the red-tailed 
birds are females or (as I have described them) males in second plumage. 
Mr. Cassin's assignation of the red-tailed bird to the adult 
male and the white bird to the adult female is obviously incorrect; 
and the separation of his Muscipeta speciosa from M. ducTiaillui is 

356 MTTSCICAPLD-E. 

also not right, as the black upper tail-coverts are found in our red-

backed specimen (?) along with the white on the wing and on the 

tail, and are evidently signs of an approach to the adult stage. 

Spec, g is still chiefly black on the back and upper tail-coverts, the 

white beginning to predominate; in all other respects the bird is in 

perfect plumage. 

The specimen from Old Calabar has white under tail-coverts, and 

is of a glossy steel-black without any green gloss on the head and 

throat; the axillaries are also white. The difference in the glossy 

shade may be due to preservation in spirit; while the white under 

tail-coverts and axillaries appear to be only a sign of perfect 

maturity. 

Adult male. General colour above pure white, the middle of the 

back slightly streaked with black; wing-coverts white; primary-

coverts and primaries black, the secondaries black broadly edged 

with white; some of the outer greater wing-coverts tipped with * 

white; tail-feathers white, slightly edged with blackish and with 

black shafts, some of the feathers black with more or less white at„ 

the tip and near the base; head and crest, sides of face, and throat 

glossy steel-green, extending upon the breast and gradually shading 

off on the abdomen and under tail-coverts, which are dark slaty 

grey; thighs white ; under wing-coverts white, the axillaries slaty 

grey with white edgings. Total length 14 inches, culmen 0*65, 

wing 3"4, tail 3*8, middle tail-feathers 10, tarsus 0*55. 

The bird described not having a perfect tail, the entire length and 

that of the centre tail-feathers are added from Br. Smith's Old-

Calabar specimen. 

The observations on the change of plumage have been made from 

West-African specimens ; but the Abyssinian and Senegambian birds 

are also found to follow the same sequence, and only one wide


spread species can be recognized. I have noticed, however, that in 

some of the males in changing dress the white tail is assumed by a 

moult, while occasionally it is arrived at by a change of feather, the 

actual feather itself changing from red to white without a moult.

Obs. In my * Catalogue of African Birds' I united my specimens 
of this species to T. nigriceps, not having a good series of the latter, 
and supposing it to be the not fully plumaged phase. Having since 
got a set of adult males of T. nigriceps, there is no doubt that the 
two species are easily distinguishable. 

The gradual development of white on the wings probably indicates 
a complete white plumage, which the series in the Museum does not 
exemplify. A specimen, however, with the steel-blue colour extending 
upon the fore neck and chest, in addition to the white on the 
wings, may give a hint as to the nature of the final dress.

feathers considerably paler both at the tips and on the outer webs; 
forehead and lores slightly hoary; feathers below the eye darker 
slate-colour; eyelid dull whitish; cheeks, throat, and fore neck

Obs. I consider M. concinna to be really a distinct species from 

M. ruhecula, but on totally different grounds from those given by 
Mr. Gould. Indeed, if we did not know that his specimens were 
from North-west Australia, his figures and descriptions would be 
referable to M. ruhecula. The chief difference in the male birds is 
the presence of the black frontal line and black lores of M. concinna. 
The specimens from South-eastern New Guinea belong to 21. rubeada, 
not to M. concinna.

it perpetuates an error in locality.

Obs. The character by which Mr. Gray separated M. melanura 
from M. ealedonica was the absence of white edging to the outer 
tail-feather. This is true of the Erromango bird, and of the one 
from Yanua Lava; but in the specimen from Aneiteum the outer

though not to the same extent. The amount of white on the tail 

evidently varies, and does not commend itself to me as a strong 

specific character. 

Adult female. General colour above light brown, somewhat shaded 

with ashy, especially on the rump and upper tail-coveits; wing-

coverts like the back, the edge of the wing white, as well as the tips 

to the greater coverts; quills dark brown, edged with lighter brown 

like the back ; tail light brown, the outer feathers ashy white at the

feather, which is edged with ashy white along the outer web also ; 

head darker than the back and distinctly shaded with slaty grey, as 

also the sides of the face; feathers in front of the eye lighter grey; 

round the eye a ring of whitish plumes • cheeks, throat, and breast 

light orange-buff, becoming gradually paler towards the abdomen, 

which is biiffy white, the under tail-coverts whiter; under wing-

Lord Tweeddale, in the ' Birds of Burma,' suggests that this species, which is 
founded on a single carbolized specimen, may be the same as his Abrornis 
chrysea, but that the colours* have undergone some change from the carbolization 
of the skin. This seems to be extremely probable.

Adult. Crown of head and hind neck ashy grey, rather darker 
ashy on the sides of the crown; mantle and upper back also ashy 
grey, with a slight wash of yellow, the lower back, rump, and upper 
tail-coverts olive-yellow, with a white suhterminal shade on the 
rump-feathers; wing-coverts olive-yellowish, like the lower back; 
greater coverts and quills dusky brown, externally olive-yellowish, 
the primaries margined with brighter yellow; tail-feathers ashy 
brown, edged narrowly with olive-yellow on the outer web and with 
white on the inner web, increasing in extent towards the two outermost, 
which are almost entirely white, excepting near the base and 
towards the end of the outer web; over the eye a long white streak 
from the base of the nostrils to the sides of the nape; round the 
eye a ring of white feathers, dusky in front and behind, where it 
adjoins the dusky spot in front of the eye and the upper margin of 
the ear-coverts; feathers below the eye and ear-coverts ashy 
whitish, browner along the upper edge of the latter; cheeks and 
entire under surface of body bright yellow, the flank-feathers long 
and silky, with a subterminal shade of white ; under wing-coverts 
yellow, as well as the edge of the wing; axillaries white, slightly

Ohs. The specimens of this bird from the North-western Himalayas 
are generally rather more ashy brown on the head, and are 
rather larger; in this state they are Gryptobpha albosuperciliaris 
of Indian authors. These .birds can, however, be matched by some 
Nepalese examples. In the Eastern Himalayas the specimens have 
the head rather clearer blue-grey, and are smaller in dimensions 
(Oryptolopha scanthoschista, Hodgs., and C.jerdoniy Brooks).

In the specimen collected by Mr. Fotheringham the crown is ashy

of the neck, as in the allied Javan species. The mixing of the 
black and fawn-colour is probably due to bad preparation of the

Ohs. The tint in the males raries from a purplish-Mack lustre to 
an oily greenish black. The most completely purple specimen examined 
by me is one from S.E. Xew Guinea, collected by D'Albeitis* 
and lent me by Count Salvador! ; but every gradation is seen in a 
series from this purplish colour to the oily green and steel-green. 
The birds from Batehian and Gilolo are smaller, but do not seem to 
constitute more than a race.

the head dull steel-blue, shading off on the bind neck, the latter 
and the mantle dark ashy brown ; wings like the back, the primary-
coverts tipped with dusky, the quills dusky brown on the mum

Obs. The present species differs from P. alecto only in having a 
very much longer and thinner bill, but the females are distinguishable 
by the characters given in the key. Neither in the JBritish 
Museum nor in the series collected by Dr. Beccari, and lent to me 
by Count Salvadori, is there an adult male from the Aru Islands. 
Nevertheless I believe that the birds from the latter locality are 
identical with P. nitidus, judging from the narrowness of the bill 
and the exactly similar coloration of the females.

and tail rufous ; frontal plumes, lores, sides of face, and under sur


face of body rufous, much paler and inclining to white on the lower

wanting the black throat. Total length 6*5 inches, culmen 0*65, 

wing 3*6, tail 3*2, tarsus 0*7. (Mus. Civic. Genov.) 

The colour of the under surface in the last-mentioned bird is a 

rich foxy red, and the wings and tail are chestnut; this is probably 

the natural colour of the species, as the type was preserved in spirit, 

and has evidently faded a good deal.

back; remainder of wing-coverts blue-black with large white terminal 
spots; quills brown, externally edged with ashy grey, the 
inner secondaries washed with the latter colour; upper tail-coverts 
and tail blue-black, the four outer feathers tipped broadly with 
white, decreasing in extent towards the centre of the tail; a broad 
frontal band, lores, feathers above the eye, sides of face, ear-coverts, 
and throat glossy blue-black, of a velvety texture; sides of neck and 
feathers running up behind the ear, and the entire under surface of 
body white, the flanks slightly shaded with grey; thighs black ;

6-5 inches, culrnen 0*7, wing 3-1, tail 2-8, tarsus 0*65. 

The male described is from Mysol; another in equally fine 
plumage has only one row of white spots on the median wing-
coverts, none on the greater series. These spots also vary in sizo 
greatly: and as they are absent in the young bird, it is probable that 
the two rows of spots on the coverts are an indication of perfect 
plumage. 

Young. Differs from the adult in having the throat ashy, with a 
certain amount of black on the malar region ; there is no black on 
the forehead and sides of face, these being ashy like the upper parts; 
the wing-coverts are also ashy like the back, and have no white

under surface of body bright verditer-blue• under tail-coverts dark 
bluish green, broadly edged with white; thighs bluish green ; under 
wing-coverts verditer-blue; quills ashy brown below, edged with 
light brownish along the inner web; "bill, legs, and claws black"

coverts like the breast. 

Obs. The type of Mr. Gray's Ar. spilonota is from Nepal. It is a 
curious-looking bird, with long triangular dusky centres to the 
feathers of the back and breast; tho size also is rather large; wing 
3*6 inches. At the same time it cannot be a distinct species, as I 
find the same indications of triangular markings on some birds from 
Madras and other localities.

Adult male. General colour above light blue, the least wing-

coverts rather brighter and more cobalt; forehead brighter cobalt, 

extending slightly backwards over the eye; a narrow frontal line 

and space in front of the eye blue-black; cheeks, ear-coverts, and a 

narrow line across the chin at the base of the bill dark blue, the 

ear-coverts strongly washed with lighter blue ; quills and tail-

feathers dusky brown, externally blue like the back, the two centre 

tail-feathers and the inner secondaries nearly entirely blue; entire 

throat and breast orange-rufous, the lower abdomen and under tail-

coverts white; thighs blue, as also the sides of the breast; under 

wing-coverts and axillaries orange-rufous, the edge of the wing 

blue. Total length 5-3 inches, oilmen 0-5, wing 2*9, tail 2-3, 

tarsus 0*7. 

Adult female (C. ticlcellice). Similar to the male, but paler in 

colour and distinguished by an absence of black on the chin and 

face, the frontal line and lores being dull white, the ear-coverts 

greyish blue with whitish shaft-lines. "Wing 2-6 inches, tail 2*15, 

tarsus 0*65. 

Obs. Madras, and therefore typical, specimens have been described; 
but there is considerable difference exhibited by a series of specimens, 
principally in the colouring of the xmderparts. Madras birds 
are washed with orange-rufous over nearly the whole under surface, 
and this occurs in both sexes. Ceylonese specimens, on the other 
hand, are decidedly white on the abdomen, and so are the birds 
from Hattiawar, the latter, however, being a lighter blue and generally 
paler form. Burmese specimens are very dark, like the Ceylonese, 
and have a wash of orange over the whole abdomen, in this 
resembling the Madras skins. I keep the whole of these forms under 
the heading of 8. ticlcellice; but it is impossible to overlook the fact 
that the Ceylonese and Burmese specimens, as well as those from 

N.W. India, differ a good deal from the typical form, and some of the 
Ceylon examples are scarcely to be distinguished from true S. 
banyumas. It is also a question whether C. ticlcellice, G. banyumas, 
C. sumatrensis, and C. jpliilippinensis should not all be considered as 
races of one wide-spread form. 
Hob. India and Ceylon, ranging eastwards into the Burmese 
countries.

* On examining the type of Schwaneria cmndeata in the Leyden Museum I 
found that it was the same as Cyornis rujifrons of "Wallace; and the supposed 
generic distinction depends upon the state of the specimen, which has the 
feathers worn away from the base of the bill. A further comparison shows mo 
that I was wrong (' Ibis/ 1878, p. 416) in uniting C. rujifrons with pale legs to 
C. beccariana with dark legs, and I have therefore readjusted the synonymy in 
the present volume.

Adult male. Above olive-brown, the feathers of the rump long 
and silky, with a subterminal bar of white; upper tail-coverts and 
two centre tail-feathers blackish, the next feather on each side with 
a white bar on the outer web, all the other feathers white for the 
basal half, blackish for the terminal half; least wing-coverts slaty 
grey, the remainder brown, edged with the same colour as the back; 
the greater coverts and secondaries rather broadly margined with 
rusty brown, the edges narrower on the primaries; a narrow frontal 
line, lores, and feathers round the eye black, succeeded by a tolerably 
broad frontal line of white, extending backwards over the fore part 
of the eye, the neighbouring part of the vertex being shaded with 
grey; sides of face, ear-coverts, and throat slaty black, succeeded by 
a jugular patch of orange-chestnut; entire breast slaty grey, the 
centre of the body and under tail-coverts whitish, the flanks olivaceous 
brown; thighs slaty grey; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
light ochraceous buff, those near the edge of the -wing dark slatecolour; 
quills dark brown below, whity brown along the edge of 
the inner web; " bill black; legs brown; iris dark brown " {Jerdon). 
Total length 5 inches, culmen 0*45, wing 2*9, tail 2*2, tarsus 0*75. 

Adult female. As figured by Mr. Hodgson, the female has the 
sides of the face and throat grey and the gorget much paler orange-
rufous ; the breast is also much paler grey ; the white frontlet is 
also nearly obsolete. Examples answering to thi& identification are 
in the Museum, and specimens of the female bird in Colonel Godwin-
Austen's collection confirm the above determination. 

Young, Robin-like. Mottled all over with spots of ochraceous 
buff, the feathers having dusky blackish margins, the hea$ streaked 
with ochraceous; an indication of a white frontlet; under surface 
much as in adult female, but the breast mottled with ochraceous 
spots to the feathers; on the fore neck a slight appearance of orange-
rufous. 

Obs. In Hodgson's own list of his drawings in the ' Zoological 
Miscellany/ the numbers given for this species are 424, 430, 476, 

714. The three former are represented, in plate 83, as arranged in 
the typical set in the British Museum. No 714 is AntJivpes moniliger 
(plate 85, Mus. Brit.). I believe that the actual specimens 
from which the above drawings were taken are all in the Museum 
collection.

* The following species is unknown to me. As with the allied olive-backed 
birds of the genus Siphia, I believe it probable that it will prove to be the female 
or young of some bright-coloured male. It is very probably not a Cyornis at 
all, and may turn out to be BUmmyias peetoralis.

The late Marquis of Tweeddale, shortly before his death, lent me 
his series of this species, and from this it appears that the character 
which I relied on for the distinction of the species, viz. the grey 
rump, is a sign of immaturity, and that the fully adult bird is perfectly 
black. The " Key to the Species " on p. 42 should therefore 
be modified as follows :—

surface; the feathers of the rump and upper lail-covcrts with slaty-
grey edges• wing-coverts like the back• bastard wing, primary-
coverts, and quills deep black, the secondaries with slaty-black edges; 
tail-feathers black, the outer ones with a terminal shade of ashy

On comparing the above-mentioned female specimen of Mr. Hume's 
Volvocivora neglecta with the female of G. jpolioptera (which is not 
in very good condition, and therefore was not figured), the latter 
bird seems rather larger and lighter grey, but a larger series may 
show that the two species are identical. I compared the male bird 
of Camjpojjihaga polioptera with Mr. Hume's description of V. neglecta, 
and separated it on account of the grey wing-coverts, which is a 
strong feature in my new species. It would not be correct to describe 
the birds in the Museum as having the median and greater 
coverts black, edged with the colour of the back, as Mr. Hume's 
description implies, and therefore the two species may perhaps be 
quite distinct.

As the concluding pages of this Addenda were being written, the 
Museum acquired, from the collection of duplicates sent home by 
Mr. Hume to England, a specimen which I have identitled as the 
Cyomis mandelli of Hume. The bird is labelled Cyornis magnirostris 
$ , but of this being a mistake there can be scarcely any 
doubt. 

The species is an Aheonace, closely allied to A. mutt at of Ceylon, 
but differing in its browner under surface, where the fulvous-brown 
colour overshadows the whole breast and flanks; whereas in A. 
muUui the breast is white, as well as the abdomen and under tail-
coverts, extending also much higher up the breast than in A. mandellii.

The acquisition of the above-mentioned specimen shows me that 
the species is not really allied to the European AVhcatear, as its 
other name rubetraoide* would suggest. It is very different from 
all other Stonechats, and comes into the section with white throats, 
so that the synoptic table on pago 179 must bo modified as follows:— 

b. Chin and throat white, the orange-colour of the 
chest not extending to the throat.

head and upper surface of body black, wTith 
an interrupted collar round the hind neck,, insignis, p. 183.
