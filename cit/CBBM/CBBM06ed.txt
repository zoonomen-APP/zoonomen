PREFACE. 

THE Sixth Yolume of the ' Catalogue of Birds in the British 
Museum' has been prepared by Mr. R. B. Sharpe, author of the 
first four volumes of this -work. Yarious causes have somewhat 
delayed its publication ; but it is hoped ttiat the succeeding volume 
(which will conclude the family Timeliidae, and which has made 
considerable progress) will appear within the spaee of a twelvemonth, 
as also that, with additional extraneous help, the work 
generally wiH make more rapid progress than has hitherto been 
possible. 

ALBERT GUNTHER, 

Keeper of the Department of Zoohgy. 

British Museum, 
December 1881. 


INTRODUCTION. 

THE present volume treats of the first portion of the large family 
TimeliiclcB, or Babbling-Thrashes, a group which is largely represented 
in the Old World, but contains only a few members in the 
American continents. Five subfamilies have been described in the 
present volume, viz. the Bulbuls, the Wrens, the Mocking-Thrushes, 
the Solitaires, and the Bower-birds. 

The total number of species enumerated is 407; and of these the 
Museum possesses 315. The specimens in the collection are 1508 
in number. The gaps in the series are principally among the 
South-American Wrens, of which it is peculiarly difficult to procure 
examples. 

Of the many important additions that have been made to the 
collection during the past two years, the most notable (that of the 
collection of the late Mr. Gould) was not acquired before part of 
the present volume was in the printer's hands, and consequently 
the additions which it brought have had to be relegated to the 
" Addenda " at the end of the volume. 

The author takes the present opportunity of returning his sincere 
thanks to Capt. Wardlaw Bamsay, who lent him his entire series of 
Bulbuls and Wrens for comparison with the Museum collection of 
skins. The number of types in the Tweeddale collection rendered 
this act of kindness of the greatest value in the preparation of this 
volume. 

Tiii INTK0DTJCT10K, 

Again, the author cannot too deeply acknowledge the assistance 
which he haB received from Messrs. Osbert Salvin and F. Ducane 
Godman, who have lent him from time to time their excellent series 
of the American species described in this book, without which 
service it would have been almost impossible to complete the 
volume; Dr. Sclater and Capt. Shelley have also lent him many 
valuable and rare birds. 

In various ways the author has received valuable assistance and 
loans of specimens from the following gentlemen:—Prof. Newton, 
Prof. Alphonse Milne-Edwards, Prof. Schlegel, A. 0. Hume, Esq., 
C.B., Eugene Oates, Esq., Prof. Barboza du Bocage, Col. Godwin-
Austen, H. E. Dresser, Esq., Henry Seebohm, Esq., Edward Hargitt, 
Esq., Canon Tristram, and Count Salvador!. 

As in the preceding volumes, the affixes to the names of donors &c, 
in the third column of the list of specimens, may be explained as 
follows:—"[P.]" means "Presented by;" "[0.]" = "Collected by;" 
" [E.] " = " Obtained by exchange." Where none of these signs are 
employed, the specimens were purchased. In some cases the sexes 
of the specimens are enclosed in brackets, as " [ tf ]." This is to 
indicate that, although the author has no doubt in his own mind 
that the specimen is a male, the label attached to the individual 
bears no indication of the sex. Sometimes, too, the locality of a 
specimen will be seen enclosed in brackets, as u [New South 
Wales]." This is intended to show that the specimen is labelled 
"JSTew South Wales," but the author has reason to doubt the 
correctness of the locality.

* Mr. Hume would set aside AEgithina of Vieillot (founded on his Sylvia 
leucoptera, and not, as Prof. SundevaLL states, on " Le Quaclricolor" of Levaillant), 
on account of the insufficient description of the Fauvette leucopterc. No one, 
however, examining the plate can doubt that it is Iora typhia (Linn.), wrongly 
described as from America; and therefore Iora of Horsfield is superseded by 
AEgithina of Vieillot.

Ohs. Mr. Hume, in a thoroughly exhaustive paper entitled 
" Kemarks on the Genus lorn " (' Stray Feathers,' 1877, p. 423), 
has given the results of his studies, based on the specimens of lora 
in his own collection. Ey the kindness of Oapt. Ward!aw Eamsay 
I have had the specimens in the Tweeddale collection to examine. 
These, added to the good series in the British Museum, have placed 
at my disposal a set of materials which, though not equalling Mr. 
Hume's iii respect of birds from the Indian peninsula, is very rich 
in Indo-Malayan examples; and I am thus enabled to complete 
the history of the genus in the localities where Mr. Hume's material 
was insufficient. I may premise, however, that Mr. Hume's conclusions 
with regard to JEyitlwia tipliia and its races are thoroughly 
borne out by the series I have examined. 

A concise account of the results obtained by me would bo as 
follows:— 

1. JE. viridissima and JE. nigrilutea are both distinct species. JE. 
tipliia is the most widely-spread form, and embraces fivo races or 
subspecies, which cannot infallibly be recognized. 
2. The females of all the races of JE. tipliia are not to be distinguished 
one from the other, 
3. In Southern India and Ceylon the full-plumaged birds aro 
black on the head and back. Birds with more or less black aro 
found in other parts of the Indian peninsula and the Burmese 
countries ; but black-backed birds are rather the exception than the 
rule. In the Malayan peninsula, however, black-backed birds 
again occur, not to be distinguished from South-Indian specimens. 
4. In East Central India there is a black-backed form like JE. 
zeylonica, but easily distinguishable by its paler coloration. This 
race is duly noticed by Mr. Hume (t. c. p. 439), and I have seen 
many specimens of it. 
5. JE. scaputeris from Java never has any black on the males, 
which appear to resemble the females, excepting in being a little 
darker on the wings. 
6. JE. vlridis from Sumatra and Borneo is the JE. scapularis of 
authors, from the above-mentioned islands. Erom an examination 
of numerous individuals I am certain that it never has a black-
backed stage of plumage; and it might be considered a distinct species 
were it not that the adult males can be matched by others from 
Ceylon, in the stage of plumage which they assumo before getting 
 TIMELILD2E. 

the black head and back, but when they are brilliant yellow below 
with black wings and tail. Many Malaccan specimens are also identical 
with Bornean, and would have been referred by me to JE. viridis 
but for tho likelihood of their being black-backed JE. tiphia in its 
second or black-tailed stage. The yellow forehead observable in 
fully adult Bornean birds would seem to be peculiar to them. 

7. Por convenience I have kept the synonymy of the Javan and 
Bornean birds distinct; but they can scarcely be called really distinct 
species.

series of coverts; quills narrowly edged with green, the inner 
secondaries margined with yellowish green on both webs, inclining 
to white near the end of the feathers; sides of face dark grass-
green, the lores black; above the eye a narrow yellow line, and 
below the eye a larger yellow spot; under surface of body deep

Adult female. General colour above grass-green, the lesser wing-
coverts like the back; median and greater coverts dusky blackish, 
tipped with yellow or yellowish white, forming a double bar across 
the wings; quills blackish, externally edged with greenish yellow,broader 
on the secondaries, the innermost being margined with 
yellow on both webs, inclining to white at the end of the feathers ;

It should be noted that Capt. Wardlaw Ramsay collected a 
specimen in Malacca which is marked female, and which is similar in 
plumage to the male. The soft parts were:—" Bill slaty, ridge of 
upper mandible and tip black; legs bluish slate; iris bright brown." 

Young male. Not to be distinguished from the old female : " bill 
black, the mandible grey; legs leaden grey; iris white" (71". Everett). 
Total length 4*8 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 2-25, tail 1*85, tarsus 07.

Adult male (Khandala, May 12, 1876 ; B. B. Fairbank). General 
colour above glossy black, the feathers of the mantle white at base, 
slightly washed with yellow; scapulars white, the outermost black 
at the tips ; wing-coverts black like the back, with a double band 
of white across the wing, formed by the median coverts and the

(MILS* E. G. Wardlaw Bamsay.) 

Adult female (South Gorge, Khandala, April 5, 1870; $. B. Fairhanlc). 
General colour above yellowish green, rather more yellow 
on the head ; feathers of the back long and silky, the bases grey; 
tail green, narrowly edged with yellowish; lesser wing-coverts

at a glance by the black tail and much blacker wings; scapulars 
whiter; wing-bands very distinct and broad ; quills black, narrowly 
edged with pale yellow, much broader on the secondaries, which are 
white at the tips, the innermost margined white or yellowish white

culmen 0*6, wing 2*45, tail 2*05, tarsus 0*7. (Mus. B. G. Wardlaw 
Bamsay?) 

The descriptions have been taken from a carefully collected series 
in Capt. Wardlaw Bamsay's cabinet, as they seemed to show the 
changes of plumage more completely than those in the British 
Museum, which have not the sexes or dates of capture sufficiently 
well indicated. ^ * 

Ohs. Captain Lcggo gives the soft parts in Ceylonese birds (true 
JE. zeylonica) as follows :— 

Male. Iris grey, mottled with brown, occasionally hazel-brown; 
bill, upper mandible black, with a clearly defined blue edge; lower 
mandible dusky blue, with a bluish margin ; legs and feet slate-blue, 
claws black. 

Female. Iris olive-grey; bill somewhat paler than in the male. 

Burmese birds, according to Er. Armstrong, had tho " irides 
light greyish white; bill slaty blue, lighter at tip; legs and feet 
bluish grey." 

TBTELIIDuE. 

The Indian Dwarf Bulbul, in its several races, is widely spread 
over tho whole of the Indian peninsula and Ceylon, ranging throughout 
the Burmese countries to Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin .China, and 
southwards into the Malayan peninsula. On the differences of the 
races which replace JE. tigliia in tho Simda Islands and the Philippines, 
see above (p. 5). It appears to be a resident species 
throughout its range.

F. 1877, pp. 134, 441, vii. 1878, p. 454, 1879, p. 99. 
Adult male. In breeding-plumage the male has the forehead, 
crown, occiput, and nape glossy black, the black terminating in a 
well-defined curved line; the chin, throat, cheeks, ear-coverts, 
breast, sides of neck, and a broad half-collar occupying the base of 
the back of the neck and the upper back intense gamboge-yellow, 
exactly the colour of the breast in Ceylon JE. tipliia ( <$ ) in breeding-
plumage. Barely this collar is entirely uniform; generally a few 
of the central feathers are narrowly fringed at the tips with black, 
occasionally most of the feathers are so fringed. Mid back glossy 
black, rarely unbroken, generally with a little of the yellow (or, 
towards the rump, greenish) bases of the feathers showing through, 
in one specimen with a good deal of this; rump pale greenish, the 
white bases to the feathers often showing through a good deal; 
upper tail-coverts and tail black, the former with a bluish gloss 
the latter with all the feathers broadly tipped with white, the white 
not unfrequently running some distance up the margin of the inner 
and in a few cases of the outer webs also. Coverts and tertiaries 

2. AETHOEHYACHTS.
black, both median and greater coverts broadly tipped with white; 
in many specimens the tertiaries and the latest secondaries are 
broadly margined at the tips with white, bnt in some this is less 
conspicuous, and in some towards the close of the breeding-season it 
is almost entirely wanting on the tertiaries ; the primaries and 
secondaries hair-brown, more or less of the outer webs towards 
their bases blackish, and margined on their outer webs very narrowly 
(in some more, in some less) conspicuously with white. The 
abdomen is like the breast, but paler; in some with a greenish 
tinge towards the sides and on its lower half, and in other cases 
looking (in skins) nearly white, owing to the intermixture of the 
long silky white feathers of the flank-tufts ; wing-lining and axillaries, 
and more or less of the inner margins of the quills, satiny 
white; a slight primrose tinge at the bend of the wing. (Hume, 
Str. Feath. 1877, p. 443.) 

Female. The females and males in non-breeding plumage have 
the entire underparts a pale mealy yellow, slightly shaded with 
olive-green ; the head is similar, but not quite so light; the nape 
and entire back similar, but much more strongly overlaid with olive-
green. The wings and tail are as in the breeding-season, except 
that the wings have the margins, especially of the tertiaries, very 
conspicuous and much tinged with pale yellow, that the greater 
coverts often have pale yellow margins besides the white tips, and 
that the central tail-feathers are almost entirely greyish white, 
tipped pure white, and with the outer webs in many specimens 
more or less shaded with ashy, or occasionally olivaceous ashy. 

(Hume, I. c.) 

The range of Marshall's Dwarf Bulbul is given by Mr. Hume as 
follows—Western India (Kutch, Deesa, Anadra at the foot of 
Mount Aboo, Sambhur, Koochawun, Agra, Muttra, Delhi, Etawah, 
Jhansi, Sambulpoor, Allygur, Meerut, Saharunpoor).

^ Obs. Mr. Hume gives the following' note :—" In the November 
birds the legs, feet, and claws were dull smalt-bluo, and so were the 
lower mandible, gape, and edges of the upper mandible, the rest of 
the latter being blackish brown. In the June and July specimens 
the legs and feet were clear lavender-bluo; the lower mandible 
and a broad line on each sido of the upper mandible pale blue, the 
rest of the latter black (cf. Hume, Sir. F. 1877, p. 423).

* The date of publication of this plate is given by the authors themselves as 
the year 1826 (see text to pi. C). The type is said to be the Tnrdus cochinchlnoisisoi 
Latham, which is given as an inhabitant of "India" and "Cochin 
China." The description seems to imply that an Indian specimen of C. jerdoni 
was before the authors. 
t Although nearly every one has quoted Phyllorms as a genus of Boie's, I 
have not found any one giving the exact reference to the work in which it was 
described ; and although the ' Isis ' is mentioned as the work to be consulted. I 
have carefully gone through the papers of the above-named ornithologist without 
discovering the description of the genus Pfiyllomis, nor can I find that the 
name was even mentioned by him. Until this can be found out, I am compelled 
to believe that it was a MS. name adopted by Temminck in 1829, in 
which case it becomes a synonym, of Chlorojosis.

3 . CIILGROPHTS, 
Young birds appear to resemble the old females, but to be still 

greener, the orange colour on the breast being confined to a pale 

Bhadc down the centre of the body and on the under tail-coverln. 

The approach to maturity seems very gradual, and it is probable 
that both sexes are alike in the cailier stages. Black-throated 
specimens are in the Museum collection, which still retain the green 
wings of the female dress. 

The Orange-bellied Green Bulbul is plentiful in the Himalayas 
from 2000 to 4000 feet, and is found also in the hills of Assam, 
Aracan, Burmah, and Tenasserim.

Adult. General colour above bright grass-green; wings deeper 
green, with a bright patch of cobalt-blue formed by the lesser 
coverts; quills blackish, externally green, shading off into yellowish 
along the outer web of the primaries towards the tip ; tail-feathers 
dark green, dusky along their inner web's ; fore part of crown brilliant 
deep orange; lores, eyelid, sides of face, and throat black, 
fringed by a superciliary line of yellow, which embraces the hinder 
ear-coverts and skirts the black down the sides of the neck, thus 
forming a collar across the fore neck; cheeks and throat deep 
purplish cobalt, not extending onto the lower throat; remainder 
of under surface of body bright green, a little lighter in the 
centre of the body; axillaries green; under wing-coverts pale ashy, 
edged with green, the edge of the wing blue; quills ashy below, 
lighter along the inner webs; " bill black; legs bluish plumbeous ;

inches, culmen 0*9, wing 3*85, tail 2-8, tarsus 0*75. 

Adult female. Similar in colouring to the male, the orange gorget 
slightly less vivid; as, however, some specimens marked " male" 
also have a pale gorget, it may bo that the richness of colour of the 
latter depends upon age, and not upon sex.

These specimens are considerably smaller than the Ncpalese bird 
described in full above, but I can see no difference in plumage. 
Mr. Hume (Str. F. 1878, vol. i. p. 326) also calls attention to the 
smaller size of Tenassorim birds as compared with Himalayan examples, 
which latter he also states are brighter coloured. 

The Gold-fronted Green Bulbul is found in the sub-Himalayan 
region from Dehra Doon to Sikhim, extending into Lower Bengal. 
It also occurs through Aracan, Assam, and Bur mall, to Tenasserim 
and Cambodia (Harmancl; Mus. Paris), while the original specimens 
were described from Pallomberg in Sumatra. The types, however, 
in the Leiden Museum are now marked " India/' showing that the 
authorities of that institution must have become convinced that 
some mistake had taken place with regard to the locality of the 
specimens in question, which are precisely like Indian ones. The 
occurence of the species in Sumatra is very doubtful.

Adult. General colour above bright green; wing-coverts like 
the back, the least series bright greenish cobalt, forming a shoulder-
patch; quills blackish, externally green, edged with brighter green, 
inclining to yellow on the outer webs of the primaries ; tail-
feathers dull green, blackish on the inner webs; forehead bright 
orange; lores black, as also a ring of feathers round the eye; 
feathers below the latter and the nnderpart of cheeks, as well as the 
entire thorax and fore neck, black; ear-coverts and sides of neck green; 
a broad moustachial streak of deep cobalt, extending beyond the line 
of the eye; remainder of under surface of body light green, rather 
more yellow on the borders of the black throat; thighs lighter green ; 
under wing-coverts light ashy, edged with green, the edge of the wing 
blue; quills ashy below, much paler along the edge of the inner 
web ; " bill blackish ; legs and feet slaty bluish; iris brown " (Vincent 
Legge). Total length 7*5 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 3*65, tail 
2-7, tarsus 0-8. 

Adult female. Somewhat smaller than the male. Bill not so black 

as in the male; forehead green; throat-patch and cheek-stripe 

smaller. Length 7*1 inches, wing 3*4, tail 2*8. ( V. Legge.) 

Young. The male of the year appears to have the forehead and 
throat green, as specimens are often procured with golden and black 
feathers mixed with the green respectively on these two parts; the 
maxillary stripe in these is small. (V. Legge.) 

On comparing the series of adult males in Lieut. "Wardlaw 
Ramsay's collection, a perceptible difference is observed in the birds 
from Candeish and from Khandala (Fairbanlc), which have a fringe 
of yellow skirting the black throat the entire way round on each 
side to behind the ear-coverts. None of the skins from Malabar or 
Cejdon show this yellow collar at all; and it is quite possible that 
there are two distinct species. 

The Malabar Green Sulbul inhabits the forests of Malabar and 

Southern India, occurring also on the Eastern Ghats and in the 

forests of Central India. It is likewise found throughout the nor


thern half of the island of Ceylon.

green, the inner secondaries exactly like the latter ; a conspicuous 
shoulder-spot of bright cobalt, formed by the least wing-coverts; 
tail dark green, dusky blackibh along the inner webs ; lores and 
feathers at base of nostrils, eyelid (excepting the hinder part), sides 
of face, and throat black, a shade of yellowish green extending from

the fore neck; on the cheeks a violet moustachial streak; 
remainder of under surface of body bright green; axillaries and 
under wing-coverts light ashy, washed with green at the tips, the 
edge of the wing green ; quills light ashy brown below, palor along

tail 3-0, tarsus 0-8. 

Adult female. Green, without the black throat of the male; round 
the eye a ring of yellow feathers ; throat yellow; a slight indication 
of a light-blue moustache. Total length 8-5 inches, culmen 0*85, 
wing 3*65, tail 3, tarsus 0*8. (Mus. R. G. Wardlaw Ramsay.) 

Young (type of Turdus viridis, Horsf.). Differs from the adult in 
entirely'wanting the black throat, and in being dull green all over, 
with rather more yellow about the face and throat. 

The Blue-shouldered Green Bulbul appears to be confined to the 
island of Java.

conveyed a wrong impression with, regard to the differences of the 
sexes. The above descriptions were taken at the time from Dr. 
Siccre's types, and it will be seen that he had clearly defined the 
bird with the blue moustache to be the female. The correctness of 
this determination has been confirmed, by Mr. Alfred Everett (if. 
Tweeddale, ?. c), whoso specimens I have examined by the kindness 

of Lieut. Wardlaw Eamsay. 

Stoere's Green Bulbul is only known at present from the island 
of Palawan, in the Philippine archipelago.

Nestling, Ashy brown above and below, the whole plumage of a 
fluffy character, the wing-coverts with paler brown edges; head 
dusky blackish. 

The full-grown young bird is like the adult, but the grey is not so 
pure and the centre of the body below is white; wing-coverts and 
quills dark brown, edged with ashy brown; head dingy black, as also 
the base of the mandibles and chin, but there is no appearance of 
the black moustache. 

It is not easy to draw the line between B. jpsaroides and II. con-
color ; and although Assam specimens are referable to the former 
bird rather than the latter, there can be no doubt that they are 
slightly intermediate between the two. Thus Horsneld and Moore, 
in their < Catalogue' (p. 255), referred M'Clcllands birds from 
Assam to B. ganeesq, rather than to B. psaroides. In the Tweeddale 
collection also are specimens from Shillong (OhenneU) which are 
likewise darker iron-grey than Himalayan examples, and from the 
appearance of black bases to the feathers of the mantle show an 
affinity to H. concolor. 

The Himalayan Black Bulbul inhabits the whole range of the 
Himalayas from Cashmere to Assam and Arakan. As mentioned 
above, the specimens from the eastern part of its range show 
a tendency to darker coloration, and approach H. concolor of the 
Burmese hills. The species occurs at about 3000 to 5000 feet on 
the mountains, and is not known to be migratory.

becoming dark slaty grey on the lower back, rump, and upper tail-
coverts • crown of head crested, black, the feathers lanceolate in 
shape and having a greenish gloss ; otherwise the head is scarcely to 
be distinguished from the blackish mantle; wing-coverts like the 
back ; the greater coverts and quills blackish brown, with dark slaty 
grey margins; tail-feathers blackish, some of the feathers edged 
with dark slate-colour; lores, cheeks, and sides of neck black like 
head, the ear-coverts rather browner• above the hinder part of the 
eye an ill-defined spot of dark slaty grey; under surface of body 
dark slate-colour, blackish on ihe chest, where the feathers are 
black, with edgings of dusky grey; lower abdomen slightly mixed 
with white, some of the feathers being edged with this colour; under 
tail-coverts slaty blackish, margined with white ; under wTing-coverts 
and asillaries dark slate-colour, the former rather browner• quills 
brown below, inclining to ashy brown along the edge of the inner

iris dull crimson-lake " {Davison); " bill and legs lake-red; iris 
hair-brown or brilliant brown "(Wardlaw Bamsay, MS,). Total 
length 10 inches, culmen 1-05, wing4*95, tail 4*3, tarsus 0-7. (Mus.

The above description has been drawn up from the type of H. yunnanensis, 
kindly lent by Dr. Anderson • however, I have examined, 
besides, the large series belonging to Lieut. "Wardlaw Ramsay, who 
collected the birds himself in Burmalu Dr. Anderson's bird appears 
somewhat more ashy brown than the majority of Lieut. Ramsay's 
skins; but this is, I think, due to the fading away of the grey

Mr. Hume considered at one time that birds from Southern Tonasserim 
(27. suhniger, Hume) were distinct from those of the northern 
part of the province; but recently ho has retracted this decision. 
He writes :—" Ko doubt the southern birds I thus designated are 
always somewhat, in some cases, much darker than the northern 
Pahpoon birds, which, agree precisely with Blyths type; but after 
careful reexamination, I do not think that the difference is sufficient 
to justify the separation; and I suppress the name sulmiger, and 
unite all the Tenssserim hill birds, alike southern and northern, 
under Blyth's name." 

The Burmese Black Bulbul is found on the Tonghoo, Karen, and 
Kakhyen hills in Burmah, and in the hill country of Tonasscrim, 
where it is confined to the more open forests of the northern and 
central portions of the province; it does not inhabit the summits of 
the highest hills.

slightly brownish. (W. V. Legge, he.) 

Young. Throat and under surface lighter than the adult; wings 
and tail browner, or of a paler hue than in old birds; the quills 
deeply margined with pale tawny, and the edges of the tail-feathers 
slightly coloured with the same; tip of the bill and space round the 
nostril blackish; legs and feet dusky yellowish ; iris yellowish brown. 

(W. V. Legge, h c.) 
Obs. A variation occurs in the colouring of this species, ranging from 
grey to brown. This seems to be due to the age of the skin, the 
colour gradually fading in preserved specimens. 

Sykes's Black Bulbul is plentiful on most of the hill-ranges of 
Southern India, and extends on the western side along the Western 
Ghats to the Mahabaleshwur hills and to Matheran. In Ceylon it 
is found in the low country of the southern half of the island in 
suitable localities. It is not migratory.

The Brown-eared Bulbul inhabits the Himalaya** at a height of 
from 3000 to 4000 feet, from between Simla and llu^oorie eastwards 
to Bootan and apparently to the head cf the As<ain valley. 
It is also found in the Ivhasia hills, and the Ivakhyen liilK in Burmali.

Hemixus brunneiceps, Walden. 
Adult female (type of Hemixus brunneiceps, TTalden : Karen hills, 
2000 feet, Jan. 10, 1875 ; R. G. Wardlaw Ramsay). General colour 
above dark ashy grey, washed with brown on the back; upper tail-
coverts and tail brown, the feathers edged with doll olive-yellow, the 
tail-feathers white along the inner web; wing-coverts blackish 
brown, the median series slisrhtly, the greater coverts and quills 
broadly margined externally with yellow, imparting a yellow aspect 
to the wing, the primaries hoary grey towards the ends of the outer 
webs; crown of head and nape blackish brown ; lores, feathers below 
the eye, and the fore part of the cheeks black; the hinder part of the 
cheeks grey like the sides of the neck; ear-coverts light earthy brown, 
with an ashy-brown lustre, contrasting with the adjacent parts; 
throat white, as also the abdomen, thighs, and under tail-coverts; 
fore neck, breast, and sides of body ashy grey; under wing-coverts 
and axillaries white, faintly washed with yellow ; quills dusky brown 
below, white along the inner webs ; " bill black ; legs light brown 
or pinkish brown,* iris lake or lake-brown " (R. G. Wardlaw Rummy, 
MS.). Total length 7*5 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 3*9, tail 3'05, 
tarsus 0*6. (Mus. Wardlaw Ramsay.)

Adult male. Like the female in colour. Total length. 8*5 inches, 
culmen 0*8, wing 4, tail 3*7, tarsus 0-65. {Mas. Wardlaw Ramsay.) 

Obs. M>. Hume states that Hemixus brunneiceps of Lord Walden 
is his H. hildehranti; and this appears indubitable; but it is equally 
unfortunate that the description of the former gentleman should give 
the head as " black," while Lord Wal den's title implies that it is 
brown. As a matter of fact it is neither really black nor really brown, 
but is blackish brown in tint. 

Hildebrandt's Brown-eared Bulbul occurs through the hills of 
Northern Tenasserim, from the Karen hills north of Tonghoo to 
close to Pahpoon.

The lores, feathers at base of lower mandible, under the eye, and 
under rather more than half the ear-coverts deep brown, almost black, 
but not so black as in H.flamla and H. liildebrandti; ear-coverts 
very pale satiny brown, a shade paler than in the other two species, 
I think; entire cap, back, wings, and tail a most beautiful rich full 
brown, deepest on head and mantle, slightly paler on nape, and with 
a decided grey tinge on the rump, forming a well-defined rump-band; 
the winglet and first six primaries and their greater coverts and the 
tail-feathers without a trace of any yellow margin; the later primaries, 
secondaries, and tertiaries, and their greater coverts narrowly 
margined with bright olive-yellow; these margins are about one third 
of the width of those on the wing of H. fiavala^ and one half the 
width of those of II. liildebrandti, giving even the closed wing a very 
different appearance. Chin, and throat pure white, very conspicuously 
limited by the dark streak on either side, more so than in the other 
two species, the streak being somewhat longer; sides of neck, behind 
ear-coverts, upper breast, sides, and flanks a delicate ash-grey, rather 
a different shade to that of the other two species ; middle of lower 
breast, abdomen, vent, and lower tail-coverts white, with a more or 
less faint ashy shade, chiefly in streaks and patches; wing-lining 
white, with a faint yellow tinge near the carpal joinf, as in the other 
two species. Bill and claws black; legs and feet reddish brown; irides 
crimson-lake. Length 8-5 inches, bill from gape 0*95, wing 4-04, 
tail 3-6, tarsus 0*6. (Hume.) 

Davison's Brown-eared Bulbul is known at present only from the

In the British Museum is a specimen collected in the Philippine 
Islands by Mr. Cuming, which is either this species or a closely allied 
one ; but the colouring of the feathers has so faded from exposure 
to the light that I cannot determine the bird for certain.

* There can he little doubt that Reichenbach's generic name Euptilosus is 
founded on the Brachypus eupfdosiis, and the species might therefore be called 
Euptilosus tristis (Blyth). I consider, however, that a protest should be made 
against the adoption of specific names as genera ; and when, as in the present 
instance, the bird is well characterized and named by the original describers, 
the specific name first given should on no account be set aside. If Reichen

bach's genus Euptilosus (published without any description or identification of 
type), be allowed, the cacophonous name of the bird will be Euptilosus euptilosus. 
But as tbese double names should not, in my opinion, be used excepting under 
pressure, such as in restoring a Linnean specific name, I have proposed a new 
genus, Pinarocichla. 

* Type in Leiden Museum examined. 
t The specimens marked as T. susanii in the leiden Museum are Pycnonotus 
pusillus of Salvadori. There can, however, be no doubt that the actual type of 
Bonaparte's supposed species " in Mus. Verr." is now in the British Museum, 
which purchased two specimens from the Maison Verreaux in lh'^1. 

9. POLIOLOPHUS. 
The adult female is probably like the male; but neither the 
British Museum nor the Leiden Museum contains an identified 
specimen of this sex. 

Young female. Distinguished from the old birds by its browner 
bill, generally paler coloration, less distinct white tipping to the 
tail-feathers and the long flank feathers. 

The Crested Brown Bulbul is found in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, 

and ranges up the Malayan peninsula into Southern Tenasserim, 

where it has been met with in the neighbourhood of the Pakchan.

Adult female. Similar to the male. Total length 7 inches, culmen 
0*65, wing 3*2, tail 2*85, tarsus 0*5. 

Several specimens in the Museum are changing from an immature 
dress into the sooty-black plumage of the adult; and it would appear 
that the young plumage is olive-brown above and below, but 
paler on the under surface, while the white patch on the wing is 
absent. In this stage of plumage the bird is very like a small 
Pycnonotus of the plain olive group, but its white axillaries will 
always distinguish it. 

The White-winged Black Bulbul is frequent in collections from the 
Malayan peninsula, where it ranges as high as Province Wellesley ; 
it occurs in Borneo also., but is not so common in the latter island. 
It is not known to be migratory.

* Jardine and Selby haye described a Trichophorus tephrogenys from " India " 
(111 Orn. pi. 127), which Sir W. Jardine afterwards thought was the same as 
Swainson's T. gularis, as he had meanwhile admitted to have received it from 
Sierra Leone.' Hence Dr. Finsch replaced the name of gularis, Swains, (neeHorsf.), by that of tephrogenys of Jardine and Selby. When I first got the 
Fantee specimens I wrote to Sir W. Jardine and sent him an example to compare 
with his type, and he informed me that my bird was not his T. tephrogenys, as, 
indeed it could scarcely be, considering that the latter is described as 'castaneus.'

TIMELIIILE. 

The Bed-vented White-throated Bulbul was recently discovered 

on Kina-Balu Mountain, in North-western Borneo. 

Obs. This species is not very distinct from 0. gittturalis; but 

differs in its much darker coloration, especially on the under surface, 

which is dull olivaceous, with a white throat and chestnut-red under 

tail-coverts. There is an entire absence of the pale brown colour of 

the breast washed with yellow, and of the light yellow abdomen 

and pale fawn-coloured under tail-coverts. The crest is very long-

in G. nificrmus, and extends nearly to the mantle.

Yery similar to X. Jlavicollis in size and coloration, and rather to 
be looked upon as a variety of the latter. The greatest difference is 
to be seen in the pale yellow of the throat, which in X. JlavicoTlis is 
much more lively and extends further down on the fore neck. The 
upper parts are more tinged with greenish, the under parts paler and 
lighter coloured, with the middle of the abdomen white; u bill 
blackish; iris pearl-colour" (Emin Bey). (Calanis,!. c.) 

Sohiitt's Yellow-throated Bulbul replaces X. Jlavkollk in Angola, 
and occurs, according to Dr. Hartlaub, in the Upper Xile region, 
where a specimen was procured by Emin Bey, at llagungo, 2° 14' 
north of the equator.

Ols. Mr. Salvin very kindly showed me the type of Swainson's 
Tricliopliorus olivaceus, with which one of the Pantee birds in the 
Museum agrees perfectly. The other specimen, however, perhaps a 
male, has a darker head, of a dusky brown, only very faint h tinged 
with olive: in this specimen also the ear-coveits are darker dusky 
brown, narrowly streaked with yellow. 

The Yellow-throated Bulbul is found in the forests of Western 
Africa from Senegambia to the Gold Coast.

with yellowish shaft-linos; wing-coverts liko the back, the quills 

brown, externally yellowish olive like the back, the secondaries 

almost entirely of the latter colour; tail-feathers olive-brown, olive-

yellow on the outer webs; lores dull whitish; ear-coverts olive, 

with whitish shaft-lines; cheeks and throat dull white, washed with 

yellow; fore neck and sides of body olive-yellow, the centre of the 

breast and abdomen rich yellow, deepening into fulvous on the 

under tail-coverts; under wing-coverts and axillaries bright yellow; 

quills brown, yellow along the edge of the inner web; bill reddish 

brown. Total length 75 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 3*5, tail 3, 

tarsus 0*8. 

Obs. Some specimens have tolerably distinct yellowish shaft-

streaks on the breast-feathers, and the intensity of the under tail-

coverts varies with individuals, deepening in some almost to fawn


colour. A skin from Ashantee appears to be immature, as it has 

some rufous-brown feathers on the nape, and is altogether duller in 

colour. 

The Red-billed Bulbul inhabits the forests of West Africa, from 
the Gold Coast to the Congo.

more rufous, the primary-coverts and secondaries, as well as the 
outer webs of the secondaries, being rufous. This latter colour maybe 
due to sexual differences, as the bird is apparently a female, 
measuring so much less than the other birds. Total length S inches,

Young. Similar to the adult, but a little more reddish brown on

Obs. The species with the yellow moustache must be called A. 
latirostris of Strickland, as the latter distinctly includes this feature 
as a character in the original description. He then proceeds:— 
" In two other specimens in which the sex is not indicated, the 
dimensions and plumage are the same, but the yellow streak on 
each side of the chin is wanting, and the lower mandible wants the 
serrations, and exhibits only a small subterminal notch. These are 
probably younger individuals." Mr. Gr. E. Gray has a specimen of 

A. virens in the Museum marked as if it were the type of A. latirostris; 
but this is clearly not the case, as it has not the yellow moustachial 
streak; it must therefore be one of the other specimens mentioned 
by Strickland, which he considers to be younger birds. The same 
view of the adults and young is taken by Dr. Hartlaub (Orn. Westafr. 
p. 87); but notwithstanding this weighty authority, I do not consider 
that his view of the case is correct. If any thing, the yeHowmoustached 
bird will be the young ; but at present I believe it to 
indicate a distinct species, in which both old and young birds will be

found to have a yellow moustache, bordered by very dark cheeks; this 
latter is a very strong feature. I believe that the Museum contains 
both old and young—the immature birds throughout the dull-coloured 
Andropadi appearing to resemble the adults in general appearance, 
but always having paler bills and legs, and having also more or less 
reddish-brown wings. In all the specimens examined I have not 
yet found an absolute transition between the yellow-streaked birds 
and A. virens, although the moustache is often more plainly marked 
in some birds than it is in others. As, however, moustached birds 
with both black and light-coloured bills are represented in the 
series, I believe that it is right to admit A. latirostris as a distinct 
species. 

The question of the typical specimen may now be considered 
settled, as in a recent acquisition of birds from Mr. T. C. Eyton's 
collection one of the skins is marked '• original specimen/' 

The Moustached Bulbul is an inhabitant of the West-Afriem 
forests, from the Gambia to the Congo.

Obs. When Dr. Hartlaub described his Ant!ninth's rnftJtrqptt rm 
from a specimen in the Museum collection, the series there was so 
small that the bird might well have been taken for a distinct species. 
Now, however, the series shows every gradation from youthful 
plumage to that of maturity, the rufoub wings being accompanied by 
a pale bill and dusky-olive abdomen and under wing-covert •% As the 
bird gets adult the plumage becomes more olive, the bill is blackish 
brown, and the under wing-coverts and the abdomen brighter olive-
yellow.

Adult (Gamma River, DuChaillu). General colour above olive-
brown, a little more rusty on the lower back and rump ; upper tail-
coverts rufescent brown; tail dull rufous-brown, lighter along the 
tip of the outer feathers and along the extreme margin of the inner 
web; wings olive-brown like the back, the outer margins to the 
feathers being a little more yellowish olive; head rather darker 
olive-brown than the back, as also the ear-coverts; cheeks, throat, 
and under surface of body generally light brown, washed with yellowish 
olive, yellower on the abdomen and centre of the breast; the 
lower throat, fore neck, and chest dark brown, deepening on the 
sides of the latter; under wing-coverts and axillaries light sulphur-
yellow ; quills light ashy brown, greyish white along the inner 
web. Total length 6'8 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3, tail 2-9,

The Slender-billed Bulbul is only known from the forests of 
Gaboon in "Western Africa, whence it probably reaches to the Congo ; 
but the specimen "from this locality, determined by 11. Bouvier and 
myself, may prove on a second examination to have been wrongly 
iden titled.

Adult Above olive-brown with a yellowish tinge, the wings and

slightly shaded with this colour; ear-coverts olive-brown with faint 
stripes of yellow, the cheeks also yellowish like the under surface ; 
centre of the body, thighs, edge of the wing, and under wing-coverts 
yellow; lower surface of quills yellow along the edge of the inner

Ohs. I have no doubt that the present species ought really to be 
called A. insularis, Hartl.; but as this name was given to a bird 
supposed to be from Madagascar, the name is inappropriate. That 
of A. oleaginus of Peters is generally used as synonymous with A. 
flavescens, Hartl.; but from the locality (Inhambane) I believe that 
it will be found to be the same as the species more recently called by 
me A. hypo.rant7ius, which latter name I have suppressed. A letter 
received from Dr. Ecichenow, of the Berlin Museum, in reply to my 
inquiries, confirms the above suppositions, after an examination of 

Dr. Peters's type.

colour C. gracilis agrees with Andropadus virens of Cassin, but the 
throat down to the breast and the upper part of the head are inclining

01$. Ixtis is generally the genus omployed for this group of 
Bulbuls ; hut the first mention of the genus that I can discover is in 
the 24th livraison of Temminck's 'Planches Coloriees' (vol. iii.)t 
published in 1825, where he calls the Javan species Ixos virestens 
(pi. 382. fig. 1). He gives no characters for the genus; but in 1828 
(livr. 76) he describes and figures two species, Ixos chalocephalu*

Bill and feet blackish. Iris bright light brown. AH the feathers of the botrr 
unusually long, with very Huffy webs. Forehead and a large triangular mark 
round the eye, inclining downwards, black ; near the base of the bill, on eaeh 
side of the forehead, a yellow spot; eyelids yellowish white. Throat, fore neck, 
cheeks, and the whole of the remainder of the under parts, beautiful yellow, the 
sides of the abdomen strongly tinged with greenish grey. As all the feathers are 
rather fluffy on the upper parts of the whole body, the ashy-grey ground-colour 
of the feather makes itself \isible, and causes the terminal half of the feather, 
which is itself dull green, to have a still stronger tinge of grey. Near the base 
of the tail the green colour becomes somewhat brighter, this colour passing or 
changing into dark yellow on the crown and occiput ; quills and tail-feathers 
dark brown, with yellowish-green margins to the outer webs. Wiiu; i 

The above is a transcript of Kittlitz's description of this species, which I hare 
never seen, and which may be wrongly placed here. All those who hare 
ined specimens agree that its relations are near Pycnonotus, though Bonaparte 
insists on its being generically distinct. 

Itz's Bulbul is only known from the island of Bon in, in the Japanese A 

21 . PTCNOKOTTJS. 
and locos squamatus. Again no description of the genus is given ; 
and in the c Tableau Methodique ? (1836), where 12 species are 
enumerated under the name of locus, a perfect olla podrida of forms 
occurs, and the genus is made to include such widely different birds 
as Lvos azureus, which is a Cochoa, and locus plioenkopterus, which is 
a Campophaga. It becomes clear, therefore, that locus of Temminck 
(1825) is indefinable; and the only assignable date to the genus is 
184:0, when he gives a complete diagnosis of the characters and a 
type in locos obscurus ; the latter, however, is congeneric with Pyenonotus 
capensis, the type of Boie's genus Pyoionotus; and locus 
therefore becomes a synonym of Pycnonotus. Where Kuhl published 
the latter name, which is generally credited to him, I have not been 
able to find out; and I believe that the first actual publication of the 
genus Pycnonotus is that given by Boie in the ' Isis? for 1826. 

I cannot admit the genus Molpastes of Hume as distinct from 
Pycnonotus, its principal characters being the crest and the crimson 
under tail-coverts; but in the former respect it is approached by 
many other species, for indeed all Pycnonoti are more or less crested ; 
it forms, however, a very natural section in the genus. The African 
species also form a subgenus or natural group, being distinguished 
by a fleshy eyelid ; but many of the Asiatic species seem to have a 
thickened edge to the eyelid, and it is very difficult to tell from the 
skins whether there has been a wattled margin to the eye or not. 
On account of this difficulty I have preferred to keep all the Pycnonoti 
under one generic heading for the present.

much crested, black, the nape also blackish ; sides of face also 
black, the ear-coverts glossy chocolate-brown ; throat and fore neck 
black, shading off into brown on the brcabt, the lower feathers of 
which are edged with whity brown ; rest of under surface of body 
did] ashy white, somewhat mottled with dark-brown centres to the

Obs. With regard to the different races or species of Red-vented 
Indian Bulbuls, I have the following remarks to make on the 
British-Museum series. 

Bpecimens with a black cap and brownish-black ear-coverts 

(P. hcemorrhous), not to be distinguished from the crown of the head 
in colour, have been examined from Malabar (wing 3-7 inches), 
Coorg (wing 3'3~3-45 inches), Mysore (wing 3-55 inches), Kamptee 
21 . PYCNONOTtTS. 
(wing 3-35-3-55 inches), Chanda (wing 3-25-3-45 inches), Leoni 
(wing 3-65 inches), Singbhoom (wing 3-65 inches), Behar (wing 3-7 
inches). Some of these specimens have been sent to me by Dr. 
Anderson ; and it is quite evident that no distinctions can be made 
upon, the score of size, as the length of wing varies so much, nor is 
there any great difference in the colouring, excepting in the greater 
or less distinctness of the white edging to the wing-coverts. 

Himalayan birds (P. pygceus) are easily distinguished by their 
chocolate-brown ear-coverts and by their long crests; the hinder 
neck is black, like the head; and this black colour occupies the sides 
of the neck and the throat, extending well onto the fore nock. 
Specimens are the same from Darjiling (Jerdoti), Nepal (Hodgson), 
Kumaon (Strachey), Calcutta (Mus. Ind.\ Cachar (Mas. Lid,), tipper 
Assam (Eeid); but I notice a slight tendency towards P. intermedins 
in the Kumaon birds. 

P. intermedins, from the Punjaub and N.W. Himalayas, seems to 
be a good distinguishable race or species. It resembles the Nepal 
bird in having brown ear-coverts ; but the shade of black is not so 
strongly pronounced on the hind neck and chest; the abdomen is. 
uniform greyish ash-colour, the brown shading of the chest not 
extending beyond that part, the breast being mottled with a few 
brown centres to the feathers; but this brown shade or mottling 
does not extend nearly so far as in the Nepal Bulbul. I havo at 
present only seen a few specimens. 
The Burmese and Tenasserim species seems to be undescribed ;• 
it is a distinctly black-capped species, but having brown car-covertsas 
in P. pygceus. The black shade is confined to the throat, and 
the neck is' brown all round, there being consequently no black 
shade near the ear-coverts. 

The Common Eed-vented Bulbul is found throughout Lower. 
Bengal as far south as Midnapore, and the jungles stretching thence 
to Central India north of the Nerbudda. It ascends the Himalayas 
to a height of 7000 feet, and inhabits these mountains from Kumaon, 
eastwards to Assam.

_ Adult. General colour above brown, a little blacker on the head, 
sides of face, and throat; wing-coverts like the back ; quills dark 
brown, with faintly indicated margins of paler brown ; tail-feathers 
dark brown, with narrow whity-brown tips ; crown of head slightly 
darker brown than the back, as also the sides of face and throat, the 
ear-coverts and region of the eye blackish; remainder of under 
surface of body brown, inclining to dull whitish near the vent; 
under tail-coverts yellow; under wing-coverts and axillaries brown, 
the edge of the wing light brown; quills dark brown below, paler 
along the edge of the inner web ; " eyelid vinous red; bill and legs 
blackish; iris reddish brown" (G. E. Shelley), Total length 
7*6 inches, culmen 0-7, wing 3*65, tail 3*55, tarsus 0-85. 

The colouring of this species varies from an earthy brown to a 
chocolate-brown, and I have examined specimens moulting from one 
into the other; but I am not certain whether the paler brown dress 
is that of the young bird, or whether the dark-brown feathering is 
the normal state of the bird in perfect plumage just after the moult. 
Either case is possible, as the pale colouring might be the result of 
abrasion of the feathers. 

The Cape Yellow-vented Bulbul is strictly an inhabitant of South 
Afiica, where it is confined to the Cape Colony. Notwithstanding 
the apparently circumstantial evidence on which its occurrence in 
Ireland is based, I can imagine no bird more unlikely to have been 
met with there in a wild state. The bird may have been a caged 
specimen ; but even this appears improbable.

of the sides of the face and throat dark brown, shading off paler on 
the fore neck and chest, which are earthy brown, very-little darker 
than the back ; rest of under surface white, the vent-feathers shaded 
with yellow, the under tail-coverts bright yellow ; the plumes of the 
lower throat edged with whitish, and the adjacent white plumes of 
the breast with brown bases, the flanks also washed with pale

Young. Similar to the adult, but more dusky and much paler 
brown; the head not so blackish as in the adult, but the belly white. 
In fact the bird may be described as being like the adult, and 
having the colours distributed exactly in the same way; but the 
latter are everywhere much paler, and the margins to the coverts 
and quills are rufous-brown.

3-75, tail 3-4, tarsus 0*9. (2Ius. J. H. Gurney.) 

Adult female. Similar in plumage to the male. Total length. 
7*5 inches, culmen 0-8, wing 3-7, tail 3-3, tarsus 0*85. (Mus. 

J. H. Gurney.) 
The present species in breeding-plumage always looks much 
darker than in the winter plumage, when the light edges to the 
feathers are more perfect, and a slight shade of olive, scarcely perceptible, 
pervades the upper surface. The summer dross seems to be 
merely an intensifying of the winter one, by reason of the disappearance 
of the light margins to the feathers above and below. 

Specimens from the east coast of Africa are apparently identical 
in plumage, but seem to be somewhat smaller in dimensions.

Young (Kingwilliamstown; H. Trevelyan). Similar in plumage 
to the adult, but rather more fluffy. The general colour more of 
a reddish brown, the wing-coverts and quills edged with the latter 
colour; head dingy brown instead of black ; under surface of body 
duller than in the adult, and much lighter yellow on the under 
tail-coverts. 

Layard's Yellow-vented Bulbul inhabits the eastern districts of 
the Cape Colony, ranging through Fatal and the Transvaal to 
Damara Land on the west and the Zambesi on the east, whence i t 
extends up the east coast as far as Mombas, decreasing in size in 
Eastern Africa.

Adult male (I£ef Laics, April 27,1857; O. Sal?in). General colour 
above earthy brown, tbe wing-coverts like the back; quills darker 
brown, narrowly edged with lighter brown, the inner secondaries 
like the back ; tail dark brown, faintly tipped with ashy brown on 
the outer feathers; crown of head rather darker brown than the 
back ; cheeks, ear-coverts, and sides of iacc dark brown ; the lores, 
region round the eye, and base of lower mandible blackish ; throat 
dark brown, inclining to blackish at the base of the chin; fore neck

on the flanks and thighs; abdomen and under tail-coverts white, 
with a faint tinge of yellow on the latter; under wing-coverts and 
axillaries light ashy brown like the breast; quills dark brown below, 
ashy along the edge of the inner web; bill and feet black; iris dark 
brown. Total length 8 inches, culmen 0*8, wing 4-05, tail 3-8,

Adult female. Similar in plumage to the male. Total length 7'5 
inches, culmen 0*75, wing 3*8, tail 3*5, tarsus 0*85. 
Xestling. Brown like the adult, but paler ; below ashy whitish ; 
the head scarcely darker brown than the back. 

Ohs. Since I wrote my remarks on the African Bulbuls (P. Z. S. 
1871, p. 131) I have examined a good many more specimens, and 
I now think it would be a great mistake to continue to keep P. 
r/afjonensis with the yehW-vented Bulbuls. It is, in fact, nothing 
but a race of P. barbatus, and some of the specimens from the 
Niger and Abeokuta approach it in the dark coloration of the 
head and throat. The yellow tinge on the under tail-coverts is 
often seen on P. barbatus, though not so pronounced as in Gaboon 
specimens. 

The White-vented Bulbul is found in North-western Africa, in

Swinhoe's Bulbul was first described from tbe Chinese inlands of 
Hainan and Naochow. The specimen from Siam in the Museum 
appears to be perfectly identical; and the species will therefore 
probably be found to range through South China into Siam and 
Cambodia.

Adult male. General colour above dull brown, with a faint wash 
of olive, inclining to umber-brown on the lower back and upper 
tail-coverts; wing-coverts and quills brown, with olive margins to 
the feathers; tail-feathers dark brown, with an almost obsolete 
edging of olive near the base of the outer webs ; lores, sides of face, 
and ear-coverts like the head; cheeks light ashy brown, washed 
with olive, and scarcely daiker than the throat, which is dusky 
yellowish white with a tinge of olive; fore neck, breast, and sides 
of body brown, washed with olive, the fore neck slightly more a^hy 
brown; centre of body, abdomen, and under tail-coverts yellowish 
white, some of the longer ones of the latter coverts having lisrhtbrown 
centres; under wing-coverts and asillaries yellowish white, 
the edge of the wing ochraceous yellow; quills dark brown, brownish 
wdiite along the edge of the inner web ; ,c bill dark ; feet pale; iris 
milk-white" {Wallace, Jitf.). Total length 0*7 inches, culmen 0*05. 
wing 3*1, tail 3, tarsus 0*65. 

Adult female. Similar to the male in colour, but rather smaller. 
Total length 0*5 inches, culmen O-fj, wing 2*9, tailiHJo, tarsus 0*05. 

Obs. The colour of the iris seems to vary considerably in this 
species, from light reddish yellow ( Wallace) to orange-red. pale red. 
or whity pink (llintie), or crimson and Indian red {llanwt}j). The 
specimen figured in the Plate is one shot by Mr. Wallace, and is 
marked as having a " milk-white " iris. 

Mr. Hume gives a series of measurements, of which the following 
are thehmits:—Total length 6*8-7*5 inches, culmen 0*0; MJ*7^, wing 
2-8-3-4, tail 2*78-3*27, tarsus 0*65-0*75. The females are mostly 
smaller, but often equal the dimensions of the male. 

Great variation exists in the shade of colour in this species, some 
specimens being much lighter and others darker; and this seems to 
me to be due not only to the more or less perfect plumage in which 
the bird was in when it was killed, but also to the fading of the 
skin after death, somewhat in the same way as the skins of the 
Eypsipetes lose their colour when preserved. On the differences 
between the present species and P. phmwsus, with which it has been 
sometimes united, Mr. Hume's remarks (tttr. P. ls7^, pp. 3u9™312) 
are conclusive. 

Moore's Olive Bnlbul inhabits Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and extends 
up the Malayan peninsula as high as Tenasserim. where it is 
sparingly distributed in well-wooded tracks throughout the province 

south of Tavoy.

Adult. General colour above brown, from the nape to the upper 

tail-coverts ; wings and tail sepia-brown, edged with the lighter 

brown of the back; the four centre feathers of the latter uniform, 

but the three outermost on each side having a distinct white Bpot 

at the tip of the inner web, extending onto the outer web of the 

external rectrix ; head blackish, with a very long crest, the brown 

of the nape aLso slightly shaded, with black ; lores and feathers 

round the eye black, with a small tuft of crimson feathers below the 

hinder part of the latter; ear-coverts white, as also the cheeks, 

which are separated from the ear-coverts by a narrow black line ; 

throat and under surface of body generally dull white, the sides of 

the body earthy brown, with a distinct half-collar of blackish brown 

on each side of the upper breast; under tail-coverts crimson ; under 

wing-coverts dull white, with a wash of brown near the edge ; " bill 

black; feet grey; iris brown" (David). Total length 6-5 inches, 

culnien 0*7, wing 3*15, tail 3*3, tarsus 0*75. 

Ohs. As is well known, there is great difficulty in separating the 
Nepal bird (0. pyrrhotis, Hodgs.) from O. monlicola, the difference 
consisting principally in the greater length of the ear-tuft in the 
Nepalese bird. This is a character which seems to vary ; and its 
development appears to increase with the age of the bird, as 
Mr. Hume found that young birds did not have it at all. The 
number of white-tipped tail-feathers also varies; and although I 
was at first inclined to keep the two birds distinct, I feel sure that 
they will be found to run into one another. The Assam specimens 
are thoroughly intermediate, having tho long crest of the Nepal bird, 
but the short dark-crimson car-tuft of the Burmese and Malaccan 
race. McClelland described his Ivus monticolus from Assam; and 
Mr. Hume seems to recognize it as a distinct species, " having 
a scarlet ring round the eye, but no red tuft beneath this organ." 
The specimens in the Museum do not show this peculiarity. 

The Bed-whiskered Bulbul occurs in jungly and well-wooded 
districts in Northern India, from the Central Himalayas to Assam, 
where a modified race is met with, which extends throughout the 
Burmese countries and Southern China, down the Malayan peninsula, 
and also to the Andaman Islands.

Captain Legge gives the dimensions of the male bird as follows :— 
Total length 7*5 to 8 inches, wing 3*2 to 3*4, tail 3*1 to 3*2, tarsus 
0*75 to 0*8, mid toe and claw 0*8, hind toe and claw beneath 0*6, 
bill to gape 0*85. The female, he says, is slightly smaller: length 
7*1 inches, wing 3*1. 

Young birds of the year have the feathers of the head edged 
whitish, and the yellow of the throat less in extent and more clearly 
defined from the hue of the chest, (W. F". Legge.) 

The Yellow-eared Bulbul is confined to the hills of Ceylon, where 
it occurs up to 3500 feet, in certain districts being common at 
4000 feet elevation. It is said to have been once obtained by Dr. 
Jerdon on the Mlghiri hills; but the specimen was destroyed, and its 
occurrence out of Ceylon is doubtful.

Obs. During a recent visit to the Leiden Museum, I carefully 
examined all the specimens of Tylas in that collection, including the 
types of Schlegel's T. albigularis, which are from Mouroundava (Van 
Dam). I came to the conclusion that five species could be recognized, 
as set forth in my " Key " given below. I must confess that 
on studying the genus soon after at Paris I found great difficulty in

determining the specimens in the Museum by the help of my Leiden 
experience. I therefore consider the question of the number of 
species found in Madagascar as still a perfectly open one.

Obs. It is very probable that this may prove to be a sex of 

T. eduardi, but there are several reasons why this should not be the 
case. In the Leiden Museum are five birds of the present species, 
all alike, and all determined as males. Again, although the late 
Mr. Crossley collected numerous examples of T. eduardi, he never 
once came across any white-throated birds, which he would surely 
have done if they had been of the same species, as it was evident that 
Tylas was not a scarce bird in the parts he visited. "While admitting 
that the subject is full of difficulty, I think it possible that there may 
turn out to be in Madagascar five distinct races or species of Tylas. 
The Buff-breasted Black-headed Bulbul is only known from Southwestern 
Madagascar. The specimens collected by Mr. Audebert, and 
now in the Leiden Museum, are marked " Lavary.*'

without which the description suits the Ceylonese species (JR. melanictents). Lord 
Walden, in an elaborate paper on the " Muscicapa melanictera of Gmelin "

Adult. Yery similar to JR. squamata of Java, but distinguished by 
the much larger amount of white on the outer tail-feathers. Total

Tail of Bubigula webberi. 
Obs. The only specimen from Borneo that I have yet seen differs 
from Malayan examples in having ashy-grey wing- and tail-feathers. 
As, however, they show a considerable amount of black mottling, the 

172 TI3IELIIDJS. 

colouring may "be imperfect. In the extent of white on the tail the 
Bornean and Malaccan examples agree; and the question of their 
further identity must remain till a larger series can be compared. 
They agree with Hume's description of Lvidia webberi. 

Webber's Bulbul replaces the foregoing species in Borneo, Sumatra, 
and the Malayan peninsula.

Type. 
Irena, Honf. TV. Linn. Soc. xiii. p. 1-33 I. tureosa. 

Head of Irena crhriger, to show nuchal hairs. 

Range. Indian peninsula, Indo-Chinese countries, Malayan peninsula 
; Java ; Sumatra ; Borneo ; Philippine Islands. 

This genus was fully described by me in the present work 
(vol. iii. pp. 265-269), where it will "be found placed at the end 
of the family Dicruridse. Its position was challenged by the late 
Marquis of Tweeddale in his critique on my third volume (* Ibis,' 
1878, pp. 82, 83); and he very properly points out an eiror of mine, 
in uniting a genus like Irena, which has twelve tail-feathers, with the 
family of Drongos, one of whose special characteristics is the possession 
of only ten rectrices. I consider, therefore, that if Irena is not 
to be put with the Dicrurida?, it must be placed with the Bulbuls, 
as Blyth and Jerdon have already done. The nuchal bristles, the 
existence of which I believe I was.the first to point out, likewise 
seem to ally the Bluebirds with the rest of the Brachypodmse; but 
at the same time their nostrils are covered with dense plumes, as in 
the Drongos.

TIMELI1DJS. 

Subfamily II. TROGLODYTINJE. 

In their habits and in their form the "Wrens are essentially Timeliine. 
They possess the strong, even clumsy, legs and concave rounded 
wings which distinguish this group of birds, and they do not migrate, 
as a rule. Tho nests are generally domed, and hence one of the 
reasons for retaining the Dippers in the family. The principal characteristic, 
however, of a Wren, and one that separates them from the 
true Timeliine birds, is the almost entire absence of rictal bristles. 
I n all the true TimeUince, and even in the Bulbuls, these bristles are 
very strongly developed; and for ornithologists who doubt that 
Cinclus is a Wren, an examination of the bill alone will be sufficient 
to show that its. place is with the Troglodytince.

median wing-coverts like the back, the greater coverts and quills 
externally rufous, narrowly barred wTith dusky blown cross lines,

tail-feathers rufous, with numerous cross bars of dusky brown, over 
thirty in number• lores black; ear-covcrts, sides of face, throat, 
and chest dull rufescent brown, like the hea$, shading off into dull 
umber-brown on the flanks and abdomen, somewhat washed with

dark brown below, rufescent along the edge of the inner web. 
Total length 6'2 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 2*8, tail 3, tarsus 1*05, 

Another example in the British Museum, said to be from Bogota, 
is probably tho adult male, as it has a white forehead and the chin-
angle also wrhite. 

The young is described by Professor Baird as differing from the 
adult in having the anterior part of the body brown, instead of 
reddish, and the basal poition of the gape and lower jaw yellowish, 
instead of black. A specimen wThieh I take to be immature differs 
from the adult in wanting the cross bars on the wings, and having 
those on the tail less distinct, but more especially in having the 
head dull ashy brown, until the whole tinge of the plumage is 
duller than in the adult. 

The Keddish-brown Wren is an inhabitant of Ecuador, whence it 
extends into New Granada,

PeLseln's Cactus-Wren is stated to be from Spanish Guiana. It 
was only known from the description given by Hcrr von Pelzeln 
(I.e.), who remarks that it is similar to II. (/riseus, but is larger, the 
upper suriaee and the wings externally being uniform dull brown. 
A specimen of Schomburgk's seems, however, to belong to this species, 
which must therefore also inhabit British Guiana.

Obs. Like Messrs. Sal vin and Godman, I cannot believe in the G. 
rufinucha of Prof. Baird being a distinct species from (7. capistratus, 
and I consider it very probably only a younger stage of the latter 
species. It differs from O. capistratus, as described above, in having 

192 
TIMELIIDJS. 

the entire upper surface streaked with white and mottled with black 
spots, which impinge on the central white markings; on the mantle 
the white spots are rufcscent, on the lower back they take the form 
of long streaks bordered on each side with black ; the hind neck is 
uniform chestnut. Such are the differences shown in a specimen lent 
to me by Messrs. Salvin and Godman from Costa Eica (Oarmiol). 
This bird they have compared with Baird's type of G. nifinucha, 
which it resembles on the back; but the latter has a few scattered 
spots on the Hanks and a barred orissum. Guatemalan specimens 
in the Salvin and Godman collection have remains of both the dorsal 
spotting and the spotted flanks and under tail-coverts, and in one 
bird the latter are barred, so that these markings are evidently not 
specific characters, but disappear. Even if the idea that they are 
merely indications of age be unaccepted, and the Costa-Bica bird be 
considered a distinct race, it could never be separated specifically, on 

account of the complete gradation of intermediate links afforded by 
the Guatemalan series. 

The Chestnut-backed Cactus-Wren is only found in Central 
America, where it inhabits the outskirts of forests and open country, 
from the sea-level up to about 3000 feet elevation. It occurs 
from the State of Yera Cruz in Mexico to Costa Eica.

Obs. I have compared the specimen in the British Museum with 
the type in Dr. Sclater's collection, and find that it is not only identical, 
but that it was evidently prepared by the same hands. It 
may be, therefore, as Mr. Salvin suggests, that the collector of these 
specimens was Ploresi, who collected in Central Mexico, which may 
perhaps be the habitat of the species.

* It is strange that Lafresnaye's name should have been so long used for 
this species, in spite of the statements made by Professor Baird and Dr. Coues 
respecting the disagreement of the description with the bird usually called 
C. brunneicapillus. Thus Lafresnaye describes his Picolaptes brunneicapillus 
from "California" with the back coloured as follows:—"Parseme\ depuis la 
nuqne, des stries blanches, longitudinales et lin<§aires, occupant le milieu des

axillaries washed with tawny buff, all of them mottled with blackish 
bases to the feathers; quills ashy browu below, chequered with 
white spots along the inside of the irmor web; "bill blackish; 
lower mandible dull light bluish at the base ; legs flax-brown ; iris 
reddish brown" (If. E. Dresser). Total length 7*3 inches, culmen 
1, wing 3-35, tail 3*4, tarsus 1*05. (21 us. Salvin Sf Godman.) 

Adult female. Quite like the male, but the spots on the throat 
and breast rather smaller, therefore less crowded and less strongly 
contrasting with the sparso speckling of the rest of the underparts, 
(Cooes, B. Color. Vail. p. 15G.) 

Young. A newly fledged specimen is very similar to the adult in 
the upper parts, but the throat is whitish, with little speckling, 
and there are scarcely any spots on the rest of the underparts, 
which are, however, as decidedly cinnamon, as those of the adults. 


(Cones, I. c.) 

The Cactus-Wren is found in the Southern United States, in the 
valleys of the Bio Grande and Colorado, Southern California, Utah, 
and Nevada, ranging into Mexico, where it is common along the 
northern frontier, and extends to the vicinity of the city of Mexico 
itself.

streaks laterally bordered with black; the mantle a little darker 
than the back; least wing-coverts ashy brown, like the back, and 
streaked in the same manner; median and greater coverts ashy 
brown, barred with dusky brown and ashy or whity brown, a few 
of the greater series having a triangular white spot near the tip; 
primary-coverts and quills dark brown, notched with whity brown 
or ashy white on the outer webs, producing a barred appearance, 
extending right across the innermost secondaries; upper tail-coverts 
ashy brown, barred across with dusky brown; two centre tail-
feathers pale ashy brown, barred and mottled with dark brown, 
about nine dark bars being perceptible on them; remainder of the

the feathers next to the middle ones shaded tnth ashy; head chestnut-
brown, varied with paler tips to the feathers, producing a somewhat 
spotted appearance; lores dull white, mottled with dusky 
bases to the feathers; over the eye a very distinct superciliary 
streak, stretching from the base of the nostril to the side of the nape, 
and fringed on its upper margin with a narrow edging of black, 
which separates it from the crown; ear-coverts dull white, streaked 
with black, with which colour the feathers are edged; cheeks white, 
streaked with a few blackish edgings to the feathers; under surface 
of body white, the abdomen and flanks tinged with buff, the whole 
lower surface spotted with black; the spots on the throat and chest 
confused and rather blotched, those on the breast and abdomen 
pcar-skapoci and very distinct, smaller on the abdomen ; under tail-
coverts white, with large black spots; thighs brown, mottled with 
dusky bases to the feathers; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
white, spotted with black; quills ashy brown below, with large 
white spots on the inner web, imparting a barred appearance to the 
lower surface of the wing; " iris brown r (A. Forrer). Total length 
7*1 inches, culmen 1, wing 3*25, tail 3*2, tarsus 1*15. 

Adult female in breeding-plumage. Similar to the male in colour. 
Total length 7*2 inches, culmen 1, wing 3*2, tail 3*1, tarsus 1*1. 

Winter plumage. Not different in any particular degree from the 
summer plumage, beyond the fact that both sexes are perhaps a 
little lighter coloured and have the spots on the under surface a 
little smaller. 

Nestling male. Distinguished from the adult birds by the blackish 
head. The general style of plumage is the same, but it is rather 
more reddish and is more spotted, the back, instead of being streaked, 
having triangular white spots on the feathers, which are also barred 
with dusky blackish. The under surface of the body is like the 
adult, but the blotchings on the throat and chest are broken up, so 
that these parts appear more spotted. 

Nestling female. Similar to the nestling male, but a little more 
reddish brown above, the head clearer brown than in the foregoing.

The Venezuelan bird is specifically the same as that from Bogota. 
The skin described is in better condition than that in the Museum 
from the last-named locality, and was made the subject of my 
description on that account. Certain slight differences exist in the 
Amazonian skins, such as the broader barring of the tail-feathors 
&c, and it is possible that there are other races yet to be 
determined. 

Schomburgk's Wren inhabits Guiana, Venezuela, and Colombia, 
extending over the Upper Amazonian region into Bolivia.

Pelaeln's Wren was discovered by the late Johann batterer in 
the interior of Brazil at Matagro&so and on the Guapore river. It 
is described by Herr von Pclzeln as being very close to T. leucotis, 
but smaller, with the upper surface greyish olive-brown, with very 
little admixture of reddish, and the under surface reddish buff, with 
the exception of the centre of the breast being white. The species 
is not represented in the British Museum, and it appears to be one 
of the numerous races of T. leucotis the exact definition of which 
has yet to be thoroughly worked out, the material at my disposal 
not being sufficient.

It is doubtful whether this species and its allies should be allowed 
M l specific value, for in the series of specimens lent to me by 
Messrs. Salvin and Grodman there are certain differences which seem 
to indicate that they are races of one and the same bird. Thus in 
Guatemalan examples the lower parts are deep rufous fawn-colour 
over the whole of the abdomen up to the lower breast, while the 
cheeks and ear-coverts are ashy whitish. In Panama skins (T. 
galbraithi) the sides of the face arc purer white, and the flanks and 
under tail-coverts aro very pale fawn-buff. In the race called

birds certainly do seem a lifcilo more grey on the flanks, but there 
are others which do not differ in the least from specimens of South 
America, and it is therefore not possible to draw a line between 
them. A good deal of the grey shado below seems to be a relic of 
the immature plumage, as we find the young birds very grey underneath 
5 while it is equally certain that white-breasted birds from 
Guatemala are not to be told from those of Houth America.

deeper-coloured lower parts, these being fulvous from the middle of 
the throat to the anus, more rufescent on the flanks, which are 
obsoletely barred under some lights ; the fulvous neck leaves the 
ear-coverts and upper throat and chin in strong contrast, appearing 
silvery white, the chin and throat duller white. In T. ludovicianus 
there is no difference between the colour of the sides of face and the 
underparts. Total length 5-8 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2-25, tail 2, 

tarsus 0*9.

Tho St.-Yincent Wren is confined to the island of that name. 
The British Museum does not contain a specimen of this bird, which 
is apparently not represented in any European collection. Mr. 
Lawrence remarks:—" In its white under-plumage this species somewhat 
resembles T. mesolencus, Scl., from St. Lucia; but it is bright 
rufous above instead of earthy brown, and the flanks are li°h,t ferruginous 
instead of fulvous; it is also of larger dimensions. The 
transverse markings on the back and the round black spots an the 
crissum are strong characteristics."

Mr. Eidgway writes:—"This Wren appears to bear about the same 
relation to T. bewkhi leucogaster* that Junco insularis does to 

J. annectens; and it is a curious fact that the analogue of each 
should be the form from the interior of the continent instead of that 
from the neighbouring coast. This insular form is much greyer 
than tho T. bewlclcl sjyilurus of California and Western Mexico, and 
presents other decided differences from all the continental forms." 
Mr. Eidgway then gives some measurements of specimens of the 
two forms, showing how greatly they differ in dimensions and proportions, 
the difference from T. bewiclci leucogaster being still more 
conspicuous. 
The Guadeloupe House-Wren is only known from Guadeloupe 
Island, off the southern coast of California.

different, being darker both above and below, with the fore neck 
and chest dark ashy brown, the ear-coverts nearly uniform black, 
and the moustachial streak very broad.

the barring on the tail-coverts is absent altogether. 

The Eastern Long-billed Marsh-Wren inhabits the Eastern province 
of the United States, whence it extends into Canada, and has 
even been reported from Greenland. It is this race which goes into 
Mexico (spec, in Mus. S. Sf G.).

Adult male (Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, Dec. 31 ; A. Parrer), 
General colour above sandy or reddish brown, the scapulars and 
rump uniform; mantle and centre of the back blackish brown, 
streaked with white; crown of head and hind neck uniform pale 
sandy brown, with a blackish-brown streak along the side of the 
crown, widening on the nape; lores and a streak over the eye dull 
white; in front of the eye a brown spot; cheeks dull white, washed 
with brown; ear-coverts light brown, darker on the hinder margin; 
sides of neck light ashy brown, streaked with dull white; wingcovcrts 
light sandy brown, the least series somewhat washed with 
ashy, the median and greater coverts spotted with blackish brown, 
many of the median coverts varied with a subterminal spot of white; 
primary-coverts brown, with pale sandy-brown margins; quills 
brown, narrowly margined with ashy brown on the primaries ; the 
inner secondaries barred on the outer web with black and pale 
sandy brown, the pale bars inclining to dull white on the outer 
web; the innermost secondaries mottled with pale sandy brown and 
black, not forming regular bars; upper tail-coverts light sandy 
brown, barred across with dusky blackish, the bars very distinct; 
tail-feathers light brown, inclining to sandy brown, barred across 
with blackish, about eleven bars being perceptible on the centre 
tail-feathers, the other feathers much more broadly barred, especially 
on the inner webs, where some of the bars become almost merged 
together, on the outer feathers the light interspaces become dull 
whitish on their margins; throat dull white, shaded with pale sandy 
brown on the fore neck; sides of the body pale sandy brown, the 
centre of the breast and abdomen pure white; thighs rather darker 
brown; under tail-coverts pale sandy brown, barred across with 
white, the sandy bars also slightly marked with darker brown; 
under wing-coverts and axillaries white, slightly shaded with ashy 
brown; quills dusky brown below, whitish along the edge of the

inner web ; " iris brown " (A. Forrer). Total length 4*25 inches, 

culmen 0*6, wing 2*1, tail 1-9, tarsus 0\8. 

Birds in worn or abraded plumage appear to have the head much 
blacker, the margins to the feathers becoming worn off, when the 
light sandy-brown crown, which is visible in newly-moulted birds, 
becomes almost merged in the blackish sides of the crown. Professor 
Baird notices this peculiarity as belonging to birds from the 
interior as compared with those of the Pacific coast. Specimens of 
both forms, however, are in the Museum from the same locality, and 
the difference is due, I believe, to the state of plumage. 

The Western Long-billed Marsh-Wren replaces the foregoing 
species in the middle province of the United States and on the 
Pacific coast, whence it ranges from British Columbia to California.

Adult female (Duoiias, Guatemala : type of C. elegans). General 
colour above blackish, streaked with fulvous brown on the crown and 
sides of the nape ; centre of the nape and hind neck uniform brown ; 
mantle black, streaked with buffy white ; scapulars and wing-coverts 
brown, slightly mottled with a few blackish bars, and streaked 
along the shafts with bufTy white; greater wing-coverts lighter 
fulvous brown, barred across with black; quills externally brown, 
barred with black and fulvous brown, paler on the outer edge of 
the primaries; lower back and rump brown, with a few bars of 
dusky black, the latter part slightly more rufescent; upper tail-coverts

rufous, with numerous distinct cross bars of black; tail-feathers 

rufous-brown, barred with black, many of the bars irregular and broken 

up, the outer feathers blackish, barred on the outer web with rufous-

brown and black, the tips also rufous-brown, with remains of blackish 

bars; lores, eyelid, and a narrow eyebrow yellowish white ; ear-

coverts dull fulvous brown, streaked with dusky brown; cheeks pale 

fulvous brown, slightly varied with dusky edges to the feathers; 

throat whitish, slightly washed with fulvous; remainder of under 

surface fulvoscent, fawn-colour on the sides of the body and under 

tail-coverts, with a few dusky bars on the latter, the thighs slightly 

browner and also with a few dusky bars; under wing-coverts and 

axillaries white, with a wash of fawn-colour near the edge of 

the wing; quills ashy below, whitish along the edge of the inner 

web ; " bill above brown, below very pale brownish; feet light 

brown ; iris brown " (0. Salvin). Total length 4*3 inches, culmen 

0*55, wing 1*65, tail 1*8, tarsus 0*7. (Mus. Salvin and Godman,) 

Young. Differs from the adult in having the whole of the upper 

surface nearly uniform brown, the mantle mottled with indistinct 

blackish cross-markings and a few whity-brown streaks; quills 

more uniform, with less distinct cross bars; tail-feathers blackish, 

with less distinct cross bars, especially on the outer feathers; under


neath whiter than in the old bird. 

Ob$. Considerable variation is shown in different specimens of 
this species, some being far more rufous above and more fulvescent 
below than others ; but a great deal of this difference is dependent 
upon age and season, the breeding birds becoming evidently bleached 
and rendered paler by the abrasion of the feathers. Messrs. Salvin 
and Godman have recently united the present species to the G.polyfjlottus 
of Brazil and Bolivia ; and after examining the specimens in 
their collection as well as in Dr. Selater's, I am also inclined to 
unite the whole Neotropical series as one species; but at the same 
time the Bolivian bird has a very regularly banded tail, almost as 
in G. hrumwieeps. I subjoin the description of a Bolivian skin:— 

^ Adult (Khapaguaia, Bolivia; C. Buckley). Head dusky brown, 
distinctly streaked with fulvous brown; the hind neck more uniform 
brown; mantle black, very broadly streaked down the centre with 
buffy white; lower back and rump reddish brown, as also the upper 
tail-coverts; scapulars and w^ng-eo verts fulvous brown, slightly barred 
with dusky blackish, more distinct on the greater series; quills 
dusky brown, chequered externally with dusky and fulvous, the 
inner secondaries barred across ; tail-feathers rufous-brown, a little 
clearer on the edges, all the feathers regularly barred across with 
black, about fourteen bands being plainly discernible; lores, eyelid, 
and a narrow eyebrow fulvous brown, as also the cheeks and ear-
coverts, which are streaked with dusky brown; throat and centre 
of body dull white, the sides of the breast, flanks, thighs, and under

Obs. It is most difficult to separate this race from the true Troglodytes 
domesticus, and were plumage the only character I do not think 
that they could be kept distinct. The Western Wrens are certainly 
greyer and generally paler than the Eastern ones; but the specimens 
from Manitoba are so thoroughly intermediate, that on colour alone 
I should not hesitate to unite them. On the other hand the differ


33 . THOGLODTTBS. 
ences m the proportions of the primaries appear to be so constant as 
to demand a separation into races ; and at present I regard them as 
four subspecies, distinguished by the characters pointed out by Professor 
Baird. Ttie size and proportions of the quills play so important 
a part in the classification of some of the Old-World Warblers, that 
they should not be neglected in a study of the Few-World Wrens. 
In T. domesticus the first primary is more than half the length of the 
second, and is generally half the length of the longest quills, whereas 
in T. iXLvkmanni it is half the second. However, on the whole, 
the differences are by no means so marked in these Wrens as in 
some of the western and eastern races of Northern American birds. 
Mr. Salvin states also that the proportions of the first and second 
primaries are not constant, but so far I have found them to be so. 

The Western House-Wren inhabits the Western and Middle 
United States, and ranges from Western Canada southwards to 
California.

lower mantle and back; on the rump some half-concealed spots of 
silky white, edged with a subterminal bar of blackish; the rump 
and upper tail-coverts rather more rufous than the rest of the upper 
surface, the latter obsoletely barred with dusky blackish ; scapulars 
like the back, and with the same nearly obsolete bars; wing-coverts 
like the back, the median coverts with a tiny spot of dull white at 
the tip; the greater series earthy brown, distinctly crossed with dusky 
blackish bars, not very regular on some of the inner ones; quills 
dark sepia, externally edged with rufescent brown, all barred narrowly 
with dusky blackish, the interspaces on the primaries paler 
and more whity brown, producing a chequered appearance; tail-
feathers earthy brown, barred across with dusky blackish, the bars 
irregular and forming spots here and there, the interspaces on some 
of the feathers whity brown; lores distinctly buffy whitish, as also 
an indistinct eyebrow ; round the eye a ring of reddish buff; sides 
of face and cheeks buffy whitish, slightly obscured by dusky edges 
to the feathers ; ear-coverts earthy brown, slightly varied with pale 
fulvous centres to the feathers; under surface of body isabelline 
brown, rather lighter on the throat and centre of the body; the 
flanks and sides of the body darker and clearer earth-brown, with a 
few obsolete bars on the lower flanks; thighs uniform dusky brown; 
under tail-coverts barred, rufescent in tint, barred across with narrow 
cross lines of blackish, before which are subterminal white interspaces 
on many of the feathers; under wing-coverts dull white, 
washed with pale fulvous on the axillaries, the edge of the wing 
whiter; quills light brown below, ashy along the edge of the inner

The description is taken from a Costa-llican specimen collected by 
Mr. Boucard in March 1877, which therefore may be considered in 
full spring plumage. Throughout the breeding-season the feathers 
become considerably worn and abraded, and an ashy shade is perceptible 
on the upper parts and on the wings, caused by the wearing 
of the edges of the feathers : this is shown by a specimen in the 
possession of Messrs. Salvin and Godman (Tucurriqui, Costa Eica, 
Oct. 1864; E. Arce). After the autumn moult the plumage is 
darker and of a much deeper brown, and the imderparts are also 
more ruddy ; there is in this respect a decided difference between 
the spring and autumn plumage, but it is only a question of depth 
of tint. Young birds may be recognized at a glance by their uniform 
rufous under tail-coverts, and there are generally a few dusky 
edgings to the feathers of the throat and breast; the cheek-feathers 
are also often edged with dusky. The barring on the wings and tail 
is much coarser and broader than in the adult, and there are fewer 
bars; otherwise young birds resemble the old ones. After their 
first moult they appear like the adults in winter plumage, but are 
rather more rufous and are recognized at once by the uniform rufous 
under tail-coverts, which they appear to retain even after all trace 
of dusky barring has disappeared from the breast. The following is 

a series of measurements of the present species, taken from "the 
Museum series and the specimens in the collection of Messrs. Salvin 
and Godman. 

Yucatan. A specimen collected in the northern part of this country 
by Mr. G. F. Gaumer measures as follows :—Total length 4*5 inches, 
culmen 0*6, wing 1*95, tail 1*6, tarsus 0*7. It looks like a dark 
race of T. domesticus with strongly marked fulvous-brown chest and 
flanks. 

Guatemala. Messrs. Salvin and Godman have a fine series from 
this country, and the contrast of the reddish-brown under surface is 
very marked when compared with a series of the true T, domesticus 
or T. parkmanni. In every instance the proportions of the first and 
second quills are those of the T. domesticus form, the first primary 
being more than half the length of the second. The following are the

Though very closely resembling T. intermedins of Costa Eica and 
Guatemala, we are struck at once by a difference which the Panama 
birds exhibit on their flanks, these being perceptibly barred; the 
back and mantle also appear more banded than in true T. intermedins. 
Not much difference in size is exhibited, and the proportions 
of the 'first and second primary are as in T. domesticus. The

Motacillajurva, which in turn is taken from the " Brown Warbler" of Brown. 
Neither figure nor description suit any known species of Wren; but if identified 
at any future time, the synonymy will be as follows:—

Adult. General colour above light brown, slightly washed with 
rafoxis on the scapulars and lower back, where there are a few 
obsolete traces of dusky cross bars; lesser wing-coverts like the 
back; median and greater series light rufous-brown, with crossbarrings 
of darker brown; quills dusky brown, externally light 
rufescent, chequered with cross-markings of dusky brown, the inner 
secondaries barred across with dusky brown; rump and upper tail-
coverts bay, with a few indications of dusky cross bars on the latter; 
tail-feathers reddish brown, barred across with narrow lines of 
blackish, about seventeen being visible on the centre feathers ; lores 
dull white; feathers round the eye and a faint eyebrow pale fulvous; 
ear-coverts brown, with indistinct whitish shaft-lines; cheeks and 
throat dull whitish, with a slight fulvous tinge; remainder of under 
surface bright vinous brown, inclining to rufous on the flanks and 
under tail-coverts, which are perfectly uniform; under wing-
coverts and axillaries very pale whity browrn in colour; quills light 

"brown below, ashy on the edge of the inner web. Total length 
4-5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2*05, tail 1-65, tarsus 0*7. 

There is a general appearance about the "Wrens from South 
America that makes them easily recognizable. Their tawny flanks 
and under tail-coverts, which are quite uniform, the narrow barring 
on the tail, and the uniform upper surface are all characters winch 
distinguish them : and taken by themselves they are distinct enough 
from all except the Chilian birds*

Adult General colonr above uniform brown, the rump pale 
tawny brown with half-concealed white spots ; upper tail-coverts 
deeper tawny brown, with indistinct dusky transvermiculations; 
wing-coverts like the back, the greater series rather paler on their 
edges and having indistinct dusky cross-markings; quills brown, 
the first two primaries uniform and edged with whity brown along 
the extreme outer margin, the other primaries chequered on the 
outer web with fulvous-brown notches; secondaries barred with 
dull tawny brown and dusky brown, not very distinct on the innermost, 
which are indistinctly barred across; tail-feathers light 
fulvous brown, barred across with darker brown, more distinctly 
on the outer feathers, about thirteen or fourteen bars being distinguishable 
; lores dull white ; eyelid buffy white; over the eye a 
faint eyebrow of rufescent brown ; ear-coverts light brown, rufescent 
brown on the hinder portion; cheeks and under surface of body 
isabelline brown, dull whitish on the throat and centre of abdomen; 
flanks, sides of body, and thighs bright sandy brown, deeper on the 
under tail-coverts, which are tipped with isabelline, the longer 
feathers with one or two blackish spots; axillaries like the sides of 
the breast; under wing-coverts dull silky white • wings light brown 
below, ashy brown along the edge of the inner web. 

I have seen a good series from Chili, and look upon the bird as a 
pale isabelline race of the preceding species, having the tail more 
rufescent with pale-brown bars, and the under surface of a light 
vinous isabelline, deepening into tawny buff on the flanks and under 
tail-coverts. The under tail-coverts are generally uniform, but not 
always so, and some have distinct white tips with subterminal spotlike 
bars.

Ad alt. General colour above brown, inclining to mouse-brown on 
the head, the scapulars and back with obscure dusky bars; rump 
and upper t ail-coverts rather more rufous than the back ; lesser and 
median coverts like tho back, the greater series brown, slightly 
tinged with rufous and barred externally with dusky brown ; quills 
dark brown, chequered with pale rufous on the outer web, and very 
distinctly barred with dusky or blackish brown, the inner secondaries 
barred across both webs in a somewhat irregular manner; tail-
feathers reddish brown, barred across with blackish brown, the bars 
being about fifteen in number on the central tail-feathers, but not 
strictly conterminous; lores dull whito; above the eye an indistinct 
superciliary streak of whity brown; ear-coverts whity brown, the 
upper margin dark brown; cheeks, throat, and centre of body dull 
white, the fore neck and chest pale brown, the sides of the body 
rtifoseent, deepening on the lower flank, thighs, and under tail-
coverts, the latter being uniform; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
dull white, somewhat washed with brown; quills dusky brown 
below, whitish along the edge of the inner web; "bill brown, 
whitish at base of lower mandible; feet and iris brown" (Leotaud). 

The adult female resembles the male. 

British (hliana. Three specimens from Bartica Grove, collected 
by Mr. K. Whitcly, belong to a different race from the Panama 
birds, and are distinguished by the white throat and white belly, 
separated by a brown breast, shading off into tawny on the lower 
flanks and under tail-coverts, the latter having few bar-like spots. 
They have the following dimensions, and appear to me to be identical 
with the Santa-Marta race:—

Amazonia. A pair obtained at Xeberos by Mr. E. Bartlett consist 
of an old male and a younger female. They can scarcely be called 
the same as T. rufidus, for the male differs from the Ecuador birds 
in its distinctly barred under tail-coverts, though it agrees with 
them in its whitish throat. I consider, however, that they are 
nearer to the Guiana and Ecuador form than any of the others. 

The "White-breasted Hoiibo-Wron ranges from Guiana through 
Venezuela and Trinidad to the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta. It 
also inhabits Ecuador, and extends to Upper Amazonia; here it is 
less typical.

dusky brown, barred with darker brown, and chequered with light 
sandy brown spots and notches externally; the dusky cross-markings 
on the secondaries particularly coarse in character ; tail-feathers light 
sandy brown regularly barred with blackish brown, about ten bars 
bcino-perceptible on the centre feathers, where they are not strictly 
conterminous; lores and feathers at gape duU white; feathers oyer 
the eye and eyelid pale reddish brown; ear-coverts mouse-brown,

always traversing the feather; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
white, washed with the same rufescent brown as the breast; quills

°Peru. Two specimens from Arequipa, collected by Mr. H. Whitely, 

are of rather large size and very pale coloration both above and 

below, and they are very thickly mottled with cross bars on the 

mantle and back. Though not so thickly barred on the under tail-

coverts as some of the Central-American Wrens, they yet approach 

them somewhat in general appearance.

The third specimen appears to be young. It has uniform tawny 
buff under tail-coverts, without spots or bars; the rump and upper 
tail-coverts are strongly washed with tawny, and the tail is some-* 
what more rufous than the other two Peruvian skins. Although 
much resembling the brown-chested white-bellied race from British 
Guiana, it may be told by its isabelline throat and under surface. 

The Banded House-Wren is an inhabitant of tho highlands of 
Peru.

Adult (typo of species). General colour above dark olive-brown, 
all the feathers edged with dusky brown, producing a somewhat 
scaly appearance everywhere except on the lower back, rump, and 
upper tail-coverts, which are uniform; lesser and median wing-
coverts like the back, the greater series and the quills rather more 
reddish, brown; tail-feathers dull reddish brown; lores dusky;

body light ochraceous buff, the flanks olive-brown; the sides of the 
upper breast slightly mottled with dusky brown tips to the feathers, 
and more or less distinct whitish shaft-streaks; chin slightly whiter 
than the throat unci the breast, with a few white feathers in the 
centre ; vent and under tail-coverts rather more reddish buff than 
the rest of the under surface; under wing-coverts like the breast, 
the edge of the wing brown; quills sepia-brown below, narrowly 
edged with ashy along the inner web. Total length 4*5 inches,

The Long-tailed Wren inhabits the Khasia and Munipur Hills. 
Originally described by Moore from " JNf. India," it was entered in 
the India Museum Catalogue as from Afghanistan. On the stand 
of the specimen was written Darjiling {Griffith); but even this alteration 
was probably wrong, and the bird was no doubt collected in the 
Khasia Hills by the late Mr. Griffith. It is well known that several 
of his Assamese and Khasia birds were entered as from Afghanistan 
(cf. Blyth, Ibis, 1872, p. 89). Col. Godwin-Austen has very kindly lent 
me the typical specimens of Pnoepyga chocolatina, which is not to be 
distinguished from P. longicaudata beyond being rather brighter in 
colour. This is probably due to the type being a female, while 
some allowance must also be made for the fading from exposure to 
the light in the gallery of the old India Museum.

the tail-feathers ashy brown, pale cinnamon at the tip, before which 
is a broad black band, the ashy brown portion of the feather also 

faintly barred with blackish brown; outer tail-feather with three 
bars of pale cinnamon, the tip vermiculated with black; lesser 
wing-coverts like the back; the median and greater coverts and

eyebrow isabellino white, slightly tinged with rufous ; ear-coverts 
and sides of face dull white, the hinder part of the former dusky 
brown ; throat and breast dull white, with mesial black spots and 
streaks; the hides of the upper breast ashy brown; sides of body, 
flanks, and under tail-coverts cinnamon-buff, as also the axillaries; 
the under tail-coverts broadly barred with black; under wing-
coverts buffy white, with dusky spots and bars; quills dusky brown, 
ashy whitish along the inner web; "bill dusky, the edges pale

culmen 0-8, wing 2*7, tail 1*95, tarsus 0*9. (Mas. JSalvln and 

Godman.) 

The sexes are stated by Dr. Cones to be alike in coloration. 

Ohs. The Rock-Wren is a migratory bird, ranging to Guatemala 
in winter. A specimen collected by Mr. Salvin at the Cuosta of 
Cachil in Vera Paz, in November, is identical with another from the 
Yellowstone River, obtained by Dr. Hayden in September. 

On the other hand, two specimens from Mexico are remarkable 
for their much lighter coloration, and for the smallness of the white 
spots on the upper surface and the narrowness of the streaks below. 
These differences do not appear to me to be the result of abrasion of 
plumage to which the species is liable from its habits, but rather to 
indicate a pale resident form in Mexico. This can only be determined 
by a larger series than is at present available. These 
Mexican birds may also bo the young birds of the year in their 
first-moulted winter dress. * 

Young in first plumage (49th parallel, July 21, 1874; Dawson). 

Differs from the adult in the more uniform plumage, absence of spots 

on the upper surface and of streaks on the under; wings and 

tail much as in the adult; head and neck uniform ashy browm, with 

the faintest traco of cross bars; back pale cinnamon, as well as the 

rump and under tail-coverts, the upper back more distinctly barred 

with dusky blackish brown; wing-coverts pale cinnamon, barred 

like the back, the greater coverts more broadly; scarcely an indi


tion of an eyebrow, which is represented merely by a few light reddish 

feathers ; eyelid also pale reddish; ear-coverts ashy whitish, washed 

with j>ale reddish on the hinder margin; under surface of body 

dull whitish, the sides of the body and under tail-coverts isabelline; 

the under wing-coverts and axillaries of the same colour • quills 

dusky, with isabelline margins to the inner webs. Total length 5*4 

inches, culmen 0-7, wing 2-9, tail 2-35, tarsus 0*95. 

Obs. Young birds killed in August in Guatemala, by Mr. Salvin, 

appear to have lost the freshness which characterized the specimen 

just described. The plumage is much abraded and the bars on the upper 

surface are very distinct, while they still retain the uniform head. 

Two of the specimens are in full moult into the adult plumage. 

The Rock-Wren is found along the Rocky Mountains, through the 

highlands of Mexico to Guatemala.

regular and more broken black bar; the cinnamon frequently 
finely mottled and dusky. Chin, throat, and jugtilum dull white, the

Mr. Itidgway makes the following remarks :—H The upper tail* 
coverts are strongly barred transversely. There is a tolerably well-
defined light superciliary stripe. In no. 7004JI there is a deep 
reddish-brown suffusion across the breast, apparently an accidentia! 
stain from contact with ferruguinous earth. The differences exhibited 
in these insular specimens from the continental series «Jre 
quite slight, but they are so constant as to demand recognition. Jkm 
to colours, there is no difference beyond slightly darker shade* 
throughout; the lower parts being soft pinkish cream-colour innteedl 
of creamy white, the other portions of a darker shade to correspond-''* 
He also gives a series of measurements to show the smaller six© oC 
the insular bird.

Young. Reproduces the colours of the adults, but has the wings 
and tail less distinctly banded; underneath, the breast is a little 
more rufescent, the feathers also obscurely mottled with brown 
edgings; abdomen also rufescent, and with scarcely any dusky 
bars. 

The Common Wren occurs all over Europe as high as 65° N. lat. 
in Scandinavia and Northern Russia, but becomes rarer on the 
Ural, and occurs more frequently in the Volga district in winter. 
It is also found in North Africa, occurring in all the countries 
bordering the Mediterranean, but apparently not reaching Egypt, 
Northern Palestine seeming to be its furthest southern limit in 
this direction. It has been said to occur in Madeira and the 
Canaries; but this requires confirmation, recent observers not having 
met with the species. Westwards it ranges through Asia Minor 
to Persia, where it has been obtained on the shores of the Caspian 
and near Shiraz. Mr. Dresser considers the pale race from Central 
Asia to be the same as the European bird, but, in my opinion, 
it is always distinguishable.

under wing-coverts and axillarics like the breast, with dusky 
blackish cross lines, some of the longer coverts dull white barred 
with dusky; quills ashy brown below, lighter ashy along the edge of 
the inner web ; u bill black, brown at the base of lower mandible ; 
gape deep yellow; feet dark brown, the claws blackish; iris dark 
brown '^(Scully). Total length 4 inches, oilmen 0-5, wing 2-05, 
tail 1-35, tarsus 0*7. 

Another bird (killed by Dr. Scully on the 3rd of December) has 
the bars less distinct on the mantle, and has a few white spots on the 
wing-coverts, the eyebrow is a little plainer, and the stripes on the 
cheeks more distinctly indicated; the underparts also are more distinctly 
barred with blackish and with white, so that the lower surface 
of the bird appears lighter. 

The Cashmere Wren occurs only on the hills of Cashmere; it is 
plentiful in winter, ascending to a height of 10,000 feet during the 
breeding-season.

below; paler along the edge of the inner wob. Total length 5*9 inches, 
culmen 1*0, wing 2-8, tail 2'5, tarsus 0*8. 

Some variation in shade of colour appears to take place in a series 
of specimens, some being browner and others darker in general 
appearance. Messrs. Salvin and Godman have lent me a bird from 
Tehuantepec (Sumiehrast), which is very remarkable, being blackish, 
above, and having the under tail-covcrts uniform deep chestnut, with 
a shaft-streak of black down the centre, instead of the bands of white 
and black seen in the other specimens. The black markings on the 
abdomen are also much larger. A further examination of examples 
may prove this to be a distinct species. 

The Mexican White-throated Rock-Wren is confined to Mexico. 
The remarks on the variation in colour of this species within 
Mexican limits made by Messrs. Salvin and Godman (I. c. p. 72) 

should be studied.

Adult male (Black River, Arizona; H. AY". Henshaw). Above 
brownish ashy on the anterior and bright einn am on-rufous on the 
posterior half, the two colours shading insensibly together on the 
back; the anterior or greyish portion thickly sprinkled with 
numerous small circular dots of huffy white, each surrounded by a 

mall dusky mark; a few of these dots on the rump, but not so conspicuous 
; wing sandy rufous, both the coverts and the quills mottled 
with wavy bars of dusky blackish, the median and greater coverts 
with dull white spots like the back ; the quills uniform dusky brown 
on the inner webs and at the tips, the inner secondaries only sandy 
mfons mottled with dusky cross-barring ; tail pale rufous, narrowly 
barred across with dusky blackish ; lores dull whitish ; over the eye 
a slight eyebrow of sandy buff, as also are the feathers round the 
eye ; cheeks white ; ear-coverts whitish, the hinder margin blackish 
with whitish spots ; throat and chest white, shaded with chestnut on 
the latter; the sides of the breast, flanks, and abdomen rich chestnut, 
varied with a few spots of dull white surrounded by blackish; 
axillaries chestnut, like the breast; under wing-coverts dusky, with 
whitish cross-markings; quills light brown below, paler along the

The White-throated Rock-Wren is confined to the central region 
of Forth America, from the boundary of the United States northwards, 
extending up the Colorado valley to "Western Nevada. 


The smaller size and general browner colouring seem to be the 
chief characteristics of this race. The single specimen examined by 
mo seems hardly sufficient to settle the question: but in the above 
respects the Arizona bird differs from Mexican examples in the 
British Museum and in Messrs. Salvin and Godman's collection.

Obs. Professor Baird, in his ' Review/ separated H. leucosticta 
from II. prostheleuca, but on characters which do not hold good, as 
already pointed out by Mr. Salvin. The pureness of the white on 
the under surface or the size of the white spots on the sides of the 
head are not characters of any great import: but the black head of 
the South-American bird seems to me to distinguish it at a glance. 
Messrs. Salvin and Godman have specimens from Sarayacu, Ecuador 
(BacJcleif), and from Chira, Eastern Peru (Ilauxwell), which are 
identical with Demerara skins collected by Mr. Henry Whitely, 
excepting that one of the latter has a few white spots on the crown. 
Cabanis's description is so evidently taken from the Guiana bird, that 
his name must be applied to the black-headed form.

in Guiana, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, ranging into Eastern 
Peru. Cabanis described his species from Guiana and Mexico ; but 
his description shows that he took the black-headed species for his 

type.

Adult male. General colour above chestnut-brown, the head more 
dingy than the back, the sides of the crown being blackish ; wing-
coverts dusky, externally like the back; bastard-wing feathers 
edged with paler or more fulvous brown ; quills blackish brown, 
with the outer webs of the same colour as the back, chequered 
externally with blackish notches on the primaries, which become 
bars on the secondaries; tail-feathers reddish brown, mottled with 
irregular blackish bars and markings; a very distinct white eyebrow, 
running from the base of the bill to the sides of the nape; 
lores and a broad streak along the upper edge of the ear-coverts 
black ; sides of neck black, mottled with oval spots of white ; sides 
of face white streaked with black, with which the feathers are 
edged; throat dull white, with a few indistinct edgings of black to 
the feathers; the lower throat, fore neck, and breast ashy grey, 

the centre of the abdomen inclining to ashy whitish; sides of the 
body, flanks, and under tail-coverts rufous-brown; under wing-
coverts light ashy, the edge of the wing mottled with spots of white ; 
the axillaries ashy, somewhat washed with brown; quills dusky 
below, inclining to ashy along the inner web. Total length 4*5 
inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2*3, tail 1-5, tarsus 0*95. 

Adult female (Erontino, T. "K. Salmon). Similar to the male 
described, but a little more rufous on the upper parts and the abdomen 
; wing ^ and tail rather more distinctly barred with blackish. 
Total length 4*5 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 2-2, tail 1*45, tarsus 
0*9. (Mus. Salvin and Goclman.) 

42 . CYPHOKHINUS. 
Young. Dingy brown, with indications of blackish bars on tho 
back; the head uniform blackish, with the whito eyebrow indistinctly 
indicated; quills very broadly barred with blackish ; below 
dingy ashy, whiter on the chin, the flanks and lower abdomen 
fulvous brown; on the bastard wing a few white spots. 

The description of the adult male is from one of Mr. Salmon's 
Colombian skins in the Museum. The young bird is quite a 
nestling, collected at Jalapa by De Oca, from whose skins the 
Museum also selected an adult. The blackish head, therefore, seen 
in many specimens (on which account Prof. Baird would have 
recognized two species), seems to be a sign of more or less immaturity. 
Mexican birds are smaller than those from more southern localities 
and have distinctly shorter bills ; their colour is also palor, the crown 
exactly resembling the back in colour. They may be found ultimately 
to constitute a distinct race; but at present there seems to 
be a regular gradation in size between Mexican and South-American 
specimens, the Colombian birds being larger than the majority of 
Central-American and having the longest bills. The Central-American 
specimens have the throat more distinctly streaked, by means of the 
blackish edgings to the feathers, than either the Mexican or South-
American birds. I have examined twenty-four examples in the 
Museum collection and that of Messrs. Salvin and Godman, whose 
remarks on the species in the ' Biologia' (I. c.) should be consulted.. 

The Grey-chested Wren is distributed over the whole- of Central 
America from Southern Mexico through Guatemala to Costa Kica and 
Panama, and thence through Colombia and Venezuela, southwards 
through Ecuador to Peru and Bolivia. It is always a more upland 
species than the other members of the genus, and was found by 
Mr. Salvin in Guatemala as high as 10,000 feet, descending, however, 
to 4000 feet.

Leg of Pnoepyga albiventris. 

Range. Himalayan Mountains, ranging throughout the hills of 
Burma and Tenasserim. Not found in Malacca, but reappearing in 
Sumatra and Java. 

The right title for this genus is not easy to find, inasmuch as 
Hodgson and subsequent authors have confounded nnder one heading 
birds which are true Wrens and others which are truly Timeliine, 
the latter being Tesia castaneocoronata and T. cyaniventris. The 
literary history of these genera seems to be as follows. Swainson 
in 1831 (Faun. Bor.-Amer. p. 488) described a genus, Aijpunemia, 
with full characters, bnt without indicating any type. Ho mentions 
three species as existing in the British and Paris Museums, but undescribed 
at that date. When he speaks of the bill as resembling 
that of Ginchts, one fancies he has P. squamata before him; but 
afterwards he mentions the tail as being short and rounded, and 
that would seem to be taken from Tesia cyaniventris or its ally. On 
that account I do not think that Aipunemia of Swainson can enter 
into ornithological nomenclature, especially as no type is mentioned ; 
the name, moreover, appears to have been dropped by Swainson himself, 
as it does not re-occur in his * Classification of Birds ' (1836-37). 

In 1837 Hodgson described his genus Tesia, but also mixed up 
Aipunemia with it. At first he would appear to have questioned 
whether the latter was identical with his genus Tesia ; but as he 
mentions in a footnote the difference in the nostrils between the 
two genera, he apparently considered them distinct, though his 
meaning is by no means clear. As left by Hodgson in 1837, the 
genus Tesia was a composite one. 

Gould, in the < Icones Avium,' gives a good figure of Microura 

302 TIMELIDAE, 

squamata and founds the genus Microura, which, however, was 
preoccupied by Ehrenberg, and therefore falls to the ground. No 
date is given to this work; but we know that it was published 
between 1837 and 1841, as Hodgson in the latter year speaks of 
Microura of Gould as having been published " since " 1837. 

In 1841 Hodgson having been warned that some of his names, 
taken from the Nepalese vernacular, were likely to be rejected for 
names more classically compounded, proposed that of Anura for 
Testa, and pronounced it identical with Microura of Gould. Anura 
cannot be employed, as it is preoccupied by Dr. Gray for a genus 
of Eats and also for a genus of Ophiuridce (1840). 

In his Catalogue of Nepalese birds (Gray's Zool. Misc. p. 82), 
Hodgson further clears up his meaning by mentioning a new genus 
Ptioepyga with four species, P. concolor, P. jpusilla, P. rafiventer, 
and P. alhiventer; and he places in another genus, Oliyura, the two 
other birds previously placed with Testa. In the ' Proceedings' 
for 1845, p. 24, he fully describes Pnoejpyga and Oliyura, and 
explains that he had previously confounded the species. Olu/ura, 
therefore, is the proper name for 0. castaneocoronata and 0. cyaniventer, 
and not Testa, which is expressly stated by Hodgson to be a 
synonym oLPnoepyga. The late Mr. G. II. Gray was on that account 
quite wrong when in the ' Hand-list7 (i. p. 188) he once more united 
all the Nepalese species under Tesia, and retained Tesia for the 

section containing 0. castaneocoronata and 0. cyaniventer.

Adult General colour above dark earthy brown, the feathers 
slightly margined with dusky blackish, producing a somewhat 
scaled appearance : most of the feathers of the upper surface with 
an ochraceous spot at the tip of the feather; lesser and median wing-
coverts like the back, the ochraceous spots a little larger; greater 
coverts and quills dusky brown, rather rufosoent brown externally; 
tail-feathers rufous-brown; lores fulvescent; car-coverts brown, 
longitudinally streaked with pale fulvous along the shafts ; cheeks 
and throat dull white, mottled with dusky edges to the feathers; 
breast largely mottled with white, the feathers being centred with 
a large spot of brown and narrowly edged with dusky brown, producing 
a strongly scaled appearance; sides of breast also scaly, the 
feathers having a broad subterminal ring of white; thighs brown; 
under wing-coverts ochraceous buff, edged with brown; quills 
uniform sepia-brown below; " legs fleshy brown; bill dusky brown 
above, fleshy at the base beneath ; iricles brown " (Jerdon). Total 
length 3*5 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 2-1, tail 0-5, tarsus 0*85. 

Younger birds appear to be more rufous than the adults on the 
upper surface, and below ochraceous buff in tint, the throat being 
uniform, and the scaly appearance of the breast and sides being 
produced by ochraceous-bufF subterminal bars, instead of white; 
breast-feathers ochraceous buff, with dark-brown centres for the most 
part concealed. 

The quite young bird, P. unicolor or P. concolor of Hodgson, is 
distinguished by its yellow under mandible and uniform coloration, 
the upper surface being dull rufous-brown, more dusky on the head, 
while the under surface is sooty black, washed with brown on the 
flanks and abdomen. 

The Scaly-breasted Hill-Wren occurs throughout the Himalayas, 
ranging into the Karen Hills in Burmah.

* In uniting P. lepida, of Salvadori, from Sumatra, with P.pusillaj I do so 
with all reserve, never having seen a Sumatran specimen. As, however, there can 
be no doubt that Ptemthms earneranoi of Sumatra is identical with P. mralaius 
of Tenasserim (of* Wardlaw Ramsay, P. Z. S. 1880, p. 16), there is no difficulty 
in believing that the Himalayan Pnoepyga piosilla, which also occurs in Tenasserim, 
may extend to Sumatra.

layan bird; a rufous eyelid also conspicuous; underneath white, 
with a tinge of fulvous on the breast, the feathers edged with dusky 
brown ; sides of breast mottled with dark brown centres ; sides of 
body rufescent brown, with a scaly appearance caused by the rufe&cent 
ochre markings on the feathers, which are further edged with dusky.

Adult female. Exactly like the male. Total length 3*2 inches, 
culmen 0*55, wing 2*05, tarsus 0*8. (Mus. Lugcl) 
This seems to bo a representative form of P. pusitta of the Himalayas 
; and I have not separated it without a careful comparison of 
the two typical specimens at Leyden with a large series from the 
Tweeddale collection which I took over with me for the purposes 
of comparison. It may ultimately turn out that this Javan bird, 
which is from Mount Gede, may prove to be identical with Pnoepyga 
lepida of Salvadori from the Sumatran hills (vide anted). 
The Eufous BUI-Wren is only known as yet from the mountains 
of Java.

the back ; tail reddish brown; lores, an indistinct eyebrow, fore part 
of cheeks, and ear-coverts dark ashy, the upper edge of the ear-coverts 
browner; throat ferruginous; remainder of under surface mottled with 
ochraceous, the feathers centred with dark brown, the lower breast and

with white; flanks brown, with subterminal bars of ochraceous buff; 
under wing-coverts brown, the lower series white forming a bar;

Young. Similar to the adult, but more rufous-brown ; ear-coverts 
ashy brown; lores, base of chin, and cheeks white ; throat chestnut; 
fore neck, chest, and sides of body rufous-brown; breast and abdomen 
dusky brown, wilh whitish streaks in the centre of the feathers. 

The Tailed Hill-Wren inhabits the Eastern Himalayas. It is by 
no means a typical Pnoepyga, but has a long tail like Urocichla 
longicaudata, with which, however, it does not otherwise agree 
generically.

Range. As a rule Dippers are northern birds, and are largely 
spread over the Palsearctic Eegion -wherever there are mountains with 
swiftly flowing streams to afford a suitable habitat. They are 
found over the greater part of Europe and Northern Asia, and occur 
on the Atlas Mountains in Algeria, and again in Asia Minor and the 
mountains of the Lebanon. Though met with in Scandinavia and 
Northern Eussia, they appear to be only scantily represented in the 
greater part of the latter country; but they reappear in the Ural 
Mountains and Caucasus, whence they extend through Persia into 
Central Asia and to Cashmere; thence they range throughout the 
Himalayas, and the greater part of China and Western Siberia, 
inhabiting Kamtschatka and the Aleutian Isles. 
In the New World they are found from the Yukon southwards 
along the Eocky Mountains.to the highlands of Mexico and Central 
America. Two species only occur in South America, in the Andes 
of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.

with, subterminal markings of dusky grey ; the whole head and nock

The Common "White-throated Dipper is widely spread over Central 

and Western Europe. It has been said to occur in the Faeroes, and 

is found throughout Ireland in suitable localities, as well as Scotland 

with the Hebrides, and breeds in the northern and central counties 

of England, as well as in Wales and the south-western counties. 

In other counties it is an accidental visitor. It is found in the 

mountainous parts of France, and occurs, on migration, in the south


eastern departments, where 0. albicoUls would seem to be the resi


dent Dipper. It is only found in the mountain-streams of certain 

parts of Belgium, and is of rare occurrence in Holland. As far as 

can be determined it occurs throughout the whole of Germany, as 

far eastwards as 30° E. long.; but is probably replaced by G. albi


collis to the south of the Danube and the Swiss Alps. Its north


eastern range has not been well defined; but from the descriptions 

and figures it would appear to be the present species which is found 

in the Baltic provinces. 

A word of caution is necessary as to the identification of the 

Common Dipper and the black-bellied form (G. cinclus), which has 

been said to occur in Ireland by Mr. Dresser. An examination of 

the specimens referred to by the latter gentleman shows that the 

birds so named are only young birds of the 
year of the ordinary 

C. aquations after their first moult, at which time they are hardly 
to be distinguished from G. cinclus. G. cashmeriensis also, after 
its first moult from the spotted stage (in which all Dippers very 
closely resemble each other), is remarkably like G. cinclus. 
Though I regard all the Dippers from the countries mentioned 
above as referable to one species (C. aquaticus), the English specimens 
are much the finest in colour underneath, and form, to the 
experienced eye, an easily recognizable race. Many of the Spanish 
and Pyrenean birds, too, are as near (7. aquaticus as they are

a little darker below the front of the eye, above the latter a 
white spot; cheeks, throat, and breast white, the rest of the under

wing 3-6, tail 2*3, tarsus 1-2. 
The Pale-backed White-throated Dipper represents the foregoing 
species in the countries of the Mediterranean. I t is found in 
Switzerland, in the Austrian Tyrol, Italy, with Sicily and Sardinia, 
and throughout Greece, being probably the species which has been 
seen occasionally near Odessa, though the latter may prove to be 

C. aquaticus. In the Pyrenees and the mountains of the Spanish 
Peninsula it is also found, but in a darker form than true 0. albicollis; 
and the same may be said of the Dipper of the Atlas 
mountains in Algeria (C. minor, Tristr.).

TIMELIU^. 

The adult female in winter plumage (Oct. 26, 1874) differs from 
the full-plumaged bird in having whity-brown margins to the 
feathers of the breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts ; these, 
however, do not last long, as a female bird killed in November has 
lost all traces of them (Mus. E. E Dresser). The young female 
after the autumn moult is distinguished by broad whity-brown 
margins to the abdominal feathers and under tail-coverts: in this 
respect it resembles the old hen bird after her moult; but it is 
further distinguished by traces of dusky-brown margins on the 
white throat and breast. These must be mere traces of the preceding 
young plumage, and doubtless soon disappear. 

The "Black-bellied White-throated Dipper inhabits Scandinavia

in the Ural Mountains and in several provinces of Eussia (ef. 
Dresser, I. c). Accidental in severe winters on the coasts of 
Northern Germany, Holland, and Belgium; it has also been found 
several times in the eastern counties of England.

upper tail-coverts, the lower back pervaded with a shade of chocolate-
brown ; the rump and upper tail-coverts blackish brown, shaded 
and edged with slate-colour ; scapulars dark brown like the middle 
of the back ; wing-coverts deeper brown than the back; the greater 
series and the quills blackish brown, externally dull slate-colour; 
tail-feathers blackish brown, washed with dull slate-colour on their 
edges ; lores, sides of face, and ear-coverts chocolate-brown like the 
head, forming a well-defined line drawn from the base of the lower 
mandible; an indistinct spot of white over and under the eye; cheeks, 
throat, fore neck, and chest white; breast well defined, chocolate-
brown, about the same shade as the neck; the abdomen and Hanks 
deeper brown, as also the thighs and under tail-coverts, the latter 
slightly washed with slaty grey; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
very deep brown, darker than the abdomen ; quills dark ashy brown 
below, with a paler margin along the edge of the inner web. 
Total length 6'8 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 3-9, tail 2-2, tarsus 1*1. 

The Brown-backed White-throated Dipper has an extended range. 
It occurs in the mountainous districts of Asia Minor and the 
Caucasus and is found in Persia; ranging doubtless through the 
intervening countries in suitable localities, it is found again in the 
higher mountain-ranges of Cashmere and Ladak, and reappears 
again in the hill-regions of Sikkim and Chinese Tartary north of 
Darjiling, and thence extends into Szetchuen and Kansu in China. 
It has also been met with by Mr. Seebohm's collectors near "Krasno-
yarsk in the Yen-e-say region, and is plentiful in the Baikal 
district; but all the Siberian specimens vary somewhat from typical 
birrls, and show more or less of a strain of 0. leucogaster, especially 
in the colouring of the underparts. The bird met with at TJdskojostrog 
by MiddendorfF, and called by him Oinclus leucogaster, was 

doubtless the Siberian race of the present species. 

In the mountains of the Lebanon a Dipper is found which has 

been referred by writers to C. albicollis, but which, to my mind, 

constitutes a peculiar form, nearer to G. casJimeriensis, but with 

more of a brownish-red shade on the breast, which allies it some


what to the Q. aqiiaticus group.

Adult male. General colour above brown, extending down the 
whole back, but mnch paler on the head and neck, especially the 
sides of the latter; wing-coverts like the back, the median series 
with narrow whitish margins ; primary and greater coverts, as well 
as the quills, dark slaty grey, blackish brown on the inner webs; 
upper tail-coverts dark slaty grey, as also the tail-feathers, which 
are dusky brown on the inner webs; above and below the eye a 
slight spot of white; lores, sides of face, and ear-coverts brown ; 
cheeks and entire under surface of body white, excepting on the 
sides of the lower breast and flanks, which are dark sepia-brown; 
under tail-coverts dark brown, with whity-brown tips ; under wing-
coverts and axillaries dark sepia-brown, with slightly indicated 
whitish tips; quills ashy brown below. Total length 7*3 inches,

The White-bellied Dipper appears to be plentiful in Central Asia, 
inhabiting the district of the Upper Ob, and extending throughout 
Turkestan into the countries north of Cashmere. "Without affirming 
that the true G. leucogaster extends into the Baikal region 
and the Yen-e-say, it is certain that many of the birds shot in 
those districts approach as much to the present species as they do 
to C. cashmeriensis. They always preserve, however, the dusky 
belly of the latter to a great extent, and thus are not strictly 
identical with Turkestan specimens.

Adult. General colour above and below light chocolate-brown, a 
little more sooty brown on the chin and lores and sides of face; the 
lower abdomen also somewhat more sooty brown in colour; lesser 
wing-coverts like the back ; median and greater coverts, as well as 
the quills, blackish brown with chocolate-brown margins, a little more 
ashy on the edges of the primaries; tail dark brown, paler edged 
at the tips of the feathers; axillaries and under wing-coverts dark 
chocolate-brown; quills ashy brown below, lighter on the inner 
webs; " bill black; legs pale brown ; soles of the feet yellow; iris 
dark brown" (J'erdon). Total length 7*5 inches, culmen 0*85, 
wing 3-8, tail 2-25, tarsus 1-15. 

Many specimens have a somewhat mottled appearance, the feathers 
of the upper surface being pale brown at the tips, these lightcoloured 
ends being apparently abraded by age, so that they are 
often inconspicuous. The under surface does not appear to get 
mottled, and usually preserves a uniform brown colour. 

Young. Ashy grey all over, mottled with buffy-white spots, which 
are subterminal between two blackish bars; the spots on the head 
smaller and more in the form of stripes; the ear-coverts rather 
broadly streakod with dull white ; wing-coverts tipped with white 
spots, as also are the primary-coverts; quills dull brown, edged 
with dull whitish and tipped with the same, rather more plainly on 
the secondaries; tail-feathers ashy brown, with faint white tips; 
throat white, mottled with dusky-brown margins to the feathers; 
under surface of body like the upper, but more broadly mottled with 
white; the feathers of the abdomen very distinctly tipped with 
white ; under wing-coverts white, with dusky bases. 

The Himalayan Dipper breeds in Turkestan, and is found in 
Afghanistan, and thence throughout the whole of the Himalayas 
from Cashmere to Bootan and the Khasia Hills. Abbe David concludes 
that birds of Western China are O. pallasu

Adult General colour above and below deep chocolate-brown, 
rather blacker on the lower back and rump and down the centre of 
the belly and under tail-coverts; on the chin and sides of face a 
faint ashy shade; wing-coverts like the back, the median series 
blackish, with narrow brown margins; greater coverts and quills 
dark brown, with ashy-grey edges; upper tail-coverts dark ashy, 
edged with brown; tail-feathers dark ashy grey; under wing-
coverts and axillaries blackish; quills ashy below, lighter towards 

the base of the inner webs; " bill greenish brown; feet leaden grey; 
claws grey; iris greyish chestnut" (David). Total length 6'5 
inches, culmen 0*85, wing 3*8, tail 2*4, tarsus 1*2. 

The bird collected by Mr. Maries in the Ichang Gorge is a very 
much larger bird, darker and richer in all its coloration, and having 
the chocolate-brown of the back continued over the rump and upper 
tail-coverts as well as the entire under surface of the body. 

C. marila of Pormosa is smaller and rather different in Colour, but 
appears to be only a race of 0. pallasi.

Pallas's Dipper is found throughout Eastern Siberia, whence it 
ranges into Kamtschatka and the Aleutian Islands ; it also inhabits 
Japan and the greater part of China, as Abbe David refers the 
Dippers of Western China to this species and not to 0. asiatims. 
Mr. Hume has lately included the present bird in the list of Indian 
birds; but I have not found his authority for its occurrence, unless 
it be that the Dipper from Ladak, identified by him as G. sordidus 
(Lahore to Yark. p. 189), but supposed to bo 0. pallasi, really turns 
out to be that species.

The Sombre Dipper inhabits the mountain-ranges in the extreme 
northern portions of Cashmere and Ladak. It is also probably 
found throughout the mountains of Thibet, as it has been discovered 
by Prjevalski in Kansu and Northern Thibet.

Adult male (west side of Bocky Mountains; J. X. Lord). General 
colour above leaden grey, a trifle darker on the mantle; crown of 
bead perceptibly darker and inclining to blackish brown; wing-
coverts leaden grey like the back, with a nearly obsolete fringe of 
whitish along the tip of the median and greater series; bastard 
wing- and primary-coverts blackish brown, the latter slightly washed 
with leaden grey; quills blackish brown, the primaries narrowly 
edged, the secondaries broadly washed with leaden grey, like the 
back, along their outer edges; the inner secondaries" narrowly 
fringed with whitish at the tips; tail blackish brown; sides of face 
and ear-coverts dusky blackish, like the crown; above and below 
the eye a spot of white, generally larger above than below, but 
often indistinct in skins; entire under surface of body leaden brown; 
the throat not so grey as the rest of the under surface; some of the 
breast-feathers and plumes of the abdomen with faintly developed 
hoary whitish margins; under wing-coverts and axillaries like the 


breast, with more or less distinct whitish tips and margins; quills 
ashy brown below, greyer along the edge of the inner webs ; " bill 
black; legs dark brown" (Baird); legs pinkish white QIus. 
Smiths.). Total length 6*7 inches, culmen 0-85, wing 3*6, tail 2-05, 
tarsus 1-15. 

Adult female. Scarcely to be distinguished from the male, but 
apparently a little larger; the crowrn and sides of the head more of 
a chocolate-brown. Total length 7*5 inches, culmen 0*8, wing 3*75, 
tail 2-2, tarsus 1-25. 

Young male. Differs from the adults of both sexes in being of a 
clearer slaty grey above, the head being also of a slaty grey, hardly 
at all darker than the back; lores, sides of face, throat, and fore 
neck dull white, with greyish or brown tips to most of the feathers, 
producing a slightly mottled appearance; rest of under surface of 
body slaty grey, obscured by hoary whitish margins to the feathers. 
Total length 6-4 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 3*7, tail 1*9, tarsus 1*2. 

Obs. Mexican specimens in the cabinet of Messrs. Salvin and 
Godman appear to be of precisely the same species as those from 
North America, though the two examined by me (S. Mexico and 

45. ciNcrcrs. 319 
Oaxaca) have blacker bills than the British-Columbian specimens, 
and have less of the whitish edgings to the under surfaces. This is 
probably owing to their being shot at a different season of the 
year. 

Autumnal and winter specimens have numerous transverse crescents 
of whitish on lower parts and wings—these especially conspicuous 
posteriorly; the secondaries are also conspicuously terminated 
with a white crescent. Bill brown, paler towards base of lower 
mandible. In spring and summer the bill is entirely black, and 
the whitish markings almost entirely disappear; the young bird has 
a greater amount of white beneath than the adult in winter dress, 
and this white is disposed in longitudinal, not transverse, suffusions. 
The colour of the legs appears to bo the same at all seasons. (Baircl, 
Brewer, and Ridgiuay.) 

The American Dipper is confined to the mountainous regions of 
North America west of the Mississippi, from Alaska southwards to 
"Western Mexico and Guatemala.

Adult male (Frontino, U.S. Colombia; T. K. Salmon). General 

colour above black; crown of head white, slightly varied towards 

the nape with blackish centres, which afford a slightly streaked 

appearance; interscapulary region pure white; the lateral feathers 

adjoining the scapulars black externally, white internally, the whole 

forming a large patch of white in the middle of the back; wings 

black, the quills a little browner towards the tips; tail black; lores, 

feathers in front of and round the eye, as well as the ear-coverts, 

black; the cheeks, sides of face, and under surface of body pure 

white; the sides of the body black, as well as the under tail-coverts, 

the latter being tipped with white, as also are the thigh-feathers; 

the flank-plumes somewhat mottled with white, many of the 

feathers being longitudinally streaked and tipped with white; under 

wing-coverts and axillaries black, the latter tipped with white; 

quills black below, with a broad patch of white on the inner webs, 

forming a conspicuous band across the wing; " iris dark" (T. K. 

Salmon). Total length 6 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3*2, tail 1*7, 

tarsus 1*15. (Mus. ftalvin and Godman.) 

Adult female (Erontino, T. K. Salmon). Similar to the male. 
Total length 6*3 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3*4, tail 1*75, tarsus 1*1. 

Younger birds appear to be a little more dingy, and to have more 
or less white edgings to the feathers of the lower back and upper 
tail-coverts, while the size of the white patch on the back is somewhat 
reduced. This and the amount of blackish stripes on the 
head are characters which appear to vary greatly in the speciejs, 
probably with the age of the bird. 

The White-backed Dipper inhabits the mountains of Venezuela, 
Colombia, and Ecuador.

TIMELIIDiE. 

Subfamily III. MIMIK3B. 

The Mocking-Thrushes of America appear to form a very natural 
group, representing in the New World the strong-legged Babbling-
Thrushes of the Old. Between some of them and the Grateropi of 
the Eastern Hemisphere there is considerable resemblance; but in 
habits the two groups are very different, for, as is well known, the 
American Mocking-birds are highly esteemed as songsters, a quality 
in which the Timeliidas of the Old World are somewhat deficient. 
Some of the genera of Mimin<e, such as Gindocertliia, Rhamphocinclus, 
and Rhodinocincla, appear to connect the Mocking-Thrushes with 
the Wrens, as does also the genus Harporhynclius. Of the relationship 
of Melanojptila with the present subfamily, I am not so well 
assured, but it apparently rinds an ally in the genus Oaleoscoptes.

Type. 
Nesocichla, Gould, P. Z. S. 1855, p. 165 N. eremita. 

Range, Confined to the group of Tristan da Cunha. 
For all that Mr. Seebohm (Cat. B. v. p. 404) has rejected the 
present genus from his family Turdidce, I still consider that the 
place of NesQcicMa is nearer the Ground-Thrushes (GeocicJila) than 
it is to the Mocking-Thrushes. The characters given by Dr. Sclater 
(Toy. Challenger, p. Ill ) do not do justice to the genus, for the 
rictal bristles are much more developed than would appear from the 
figure of the biU, while the omission of the small first primary destroys 
the Turdine look of the wing, which thus appears thoroughly 
Timeliine. I consider Nesocichla to be really a Thrush, in old times 
probably a true Geotichla, with at present a modified and rounded 
wing, induced by its isolated habitat, which has rendered long flight 
unnecessary.

Adult (type of species). General colour above dark sandy brown, 
faintly mottled with darker-brown centres to the feathers of the 
mantle and back, the lower back and rump more uniform and 
slightly tinged with olive; wing-coverts like the back, spotted with 
tawny buff at the ends; quills dark brown, externally lighter 
brown, fringed with pale fulvous or tawny buff, especially distinct 
near the outer base of the primaries ; the secondaries tipped with 
pale tawny or whitish; upper tail-coverts rather lighter than the 
rump, the outer ones with narrow whitish edgings; tail-feathers 
brown, washed with ashy olive on the margins of the feathers; 
lores and nasal plumes, as well as a distinct eyebrow, sandy buff; 
ear-coverts and cheeks sandy buff, slightly washed with brown,

tlie feathers in front of and below the eye, as well as at the base of 
the cheeks, whitish; chin whitish ; remainder of under surface of 
body yellowish buff, thickly mottled with brown centres to the 
feathers, generally in the form of largo triangular spots ; abdomen 
white with brown spots, rather smaller than the breast-spots; 
flank-feathers with broad dark-brown centres; thighs uniform 
yellowish buff; under tail-coverts paler buff, sparsely spotted with 
brown on the tips of some of the feathers ; under wing-coverts and 
axillaries rich golden buff, with a slight central shade of brown on 
the former; quills ashy brown below, golden buff along tho inner 
web; bill horny black; logs palo; " iris black" (J. Murray). 
Total length 8-3 inches, oulmen 1*1, wing 3*8, tail 3*1, tarsus 1*4. 

The specimens collected during the voyage of the ' Challenger' 
do not happen to have the sexes marked; but there can be no 
doubt that the female resembles the male. Young birds appear to 
have more tawny buff on the wing-coverts, which are distinctly 
centred as well as tipped with this colour. 

The Hermit Mocking-Thrush is confined to the islands of Tristan 
and Inaccessible, in the Tristan da Cunha group.

Adult. General colour above light ashy, with nearly obsolete 

dusky streaks down the centre of the feathers ; least wing-coverts 

like the back; median and greater series dull brown, with margins 

of ashy white; bastard wing-feathers dark brown, edged with 

white; primary-coverts brown, narrowly margined with ashy 

brown; quills brown, edged with ashy brown, with a narrow 

margin of white at the end of the secondaries, the outer primaries 

with a white margin in the centre of the outer web near the 

indentation on the outside of the quill; tail-feathers dark brown, 

edged narrowly with light brown, the three outermost feathers 

with a white spot at the tip of the inner web, this white increasing 

in extent towards the outermost; lores and feathers round the eye 

white; ear-coverts light brown, as also the sides of the face; under 

surface of body white, with triangular spots of black, very small 

on the throat, but increasing in size on the breast and sides of the 

body; on the chest, flanks, and under tail-coverts a distinct tinge 

of fulvous, with only a few narrow streaks of brown on the latter; 

axiUaries and under wing-coverts fulvous, edged with white; quills 

ashy brown, lighter ashy along the edge of the inner web. Total 

length 8*3 inches, culmen 0*8, wing 3*9, tail 2-6, tarsus 1*25. 

This species bears no small resemblance to the young of the 

common Mocking-bird, which is, like it, spotted below, and for 

which it might be mistaken upon superficial examination. It is, 

however, much more heavily and sharply marked with triangular 

spots on nearly all the underparts, and differs, besides, in its 

generic characters. The bill is slenderer and comparatively longer; 

the wings are relatively much longer and more pointed, equalling 

or exceeding the tail, which is little rounded, the outer feathers 

being only about J inch shorter than the middle ones. Length 

about 8 inches, wing 4, tail rather more, tarsus 1*15, bill 0-65. 

(Coues, B. JR.-West, p. 7.) 

Young. Dull brownish above, conspicuously streaked with dusky; 
the markings below streaky and diffuse. 

Specimens differ little with sex or season, or with age after the 
first streaked stage is passed. The individual variation consists in 
the purer or more brownish ash of the upper parts, and especially 
in the shade of the underparts (which ranges from whitish to a 
decided brownish cinnamon cast) and in the amount of spotting. 
Ordinarily, the lower belly and vent, and sometimes the throat, are 
immaculate, but the whole under surface is sometimes pretty 
uniformly covered. The brownish shade is usually strongest on 
the breast, flanks, and crissum. The newly-grown quills and tail-
feathers are darker than the old ones, and have more white edging. 
The wing-coverts are sometimes edged as well as tipped with 
white. (Coues, I. <?.) 

The Sage-Thrasher has only been found in the Rocky-Mountain 
districts of the United States, extending west to the Pacific and

Tho Long-tailed Mocking-Thrush is found from Ecuador to Peru, 
ranging perhaps into Northern Chili. Birds from Puna Island are 
remarkable for their clear grey coloration, blacker lores and ear-
streak, and broader white tips to the wing-coverts. (3Ius. P. L. $.,

The adult female is like the male in plumage. 
In the nesting-season the spots at the tips of the wing-coverts 
become much abraded, as do also the feathers of the face, which 
becomes more ashy grey. Young ^'/Y/* resemble the adult, but are 
more dingily coloured, and have* dingy black spots on the feathers 
of the upper surface; the spots on the lower surface of the body are 
also much smaller and less distinctly indicated. 
Tho Brown Thrasher inhabits the eastern province of North 
America to the Missouri lliver and north to Lake Winnipeg. In the 
plains between the Missouri lliver and the Rocky Mountains along-
tailed race (B. longicaudus) was supposed to exist; but it is now 
stated that every intermediate form between this race and true 1L 
rufus can be found, and therefore no specific distinct ions between 
them can be upheld. It has occurred once in Heligoland.

Although the differences between this and the typical form are 
not very easy to express, yet they are readily appreciable on comparison 
of specimens, and fully warrant Mr. Bidgway's discrimination 
of a var. palmeri. Tho upper parts are quite similar; but the 
undcrparts, instead of being "whitish, with decided spotting of the 
colour of the back, are greyish, tinged with rusty, especially behind, 
and the spotting is nebulous. The white oh the ends of wing-
coverts and tail-feathers is reduced to a minimum or entirely suppressed. 
The bill is slenderer and apparently more curved in all 
the specimens I have seen. (In tho figure the bill is rather too 
stout.) Average dimensions of four specimens of both sexes:— 
length 10*75 inches, wing 4-33, tail 5, chord of culmen 1*12, tarsus 
1-25, middle toe and claw rather more. (Coues.)

This form, with the size and proportions substantially the same 
as those of redivivus proper, differs very notably in the pallor of all 
the coloration, being in fact a bleached desert race. Excepting the 
slight maxillary streaks, there are no decided markings anywhere; 
and the change from the pale ash of the general underparts to the 
brownish yellow of the lower belly and crissum is very gradual.

Subfamily IV. MYIADECTIK/E. 

The present position of the birds contained in this subfamily is not 
very satisfactory to my mind. After having been placed among the 
Amjpelidce by many authors, they have been recently located by 
Messrs. Sclater and Salvin in the Sylviidce,but Mr. Seebohm has not 
admitted them into his volume of the ' Catalogue.' I have therefore 
placed them near the Mocking-Thrushes, which they resemble 
in their power of song; but their broadened bill and powerful rictal 
bristles are like those of the Flycatchers, and, as Mr. Salvin has 
pointed out, they appear to be not distantly related to the members 
of the African genus Gassinia {of. Cat. B. vol. iv. p. 466).

I am unable to give any further information respecting this spe


cies, which still remains apparently unknown in European collections. 

It was described by Professor Baird from a Brazilian skin in the 

Smithsonian Institution, and there are two specimens in the Museum 

of the Philadelphia Academy. Although Prof. Baird expressly states 

that it is a Thrush, all writers on the Turdidse since his time have 

scarcely mentioned the species. It is not even mentioned in Mr. 

Seebohm's volume.

Subfamily V. PTILONOKHYNCHDfM. 

The Bower-birds have been placed in various positions in the 
class Aves. By some systematists they have been considered to be 
Thrushes, by others Birds of Paradise, while Professor Sundevall 
has associated them, with the Shrikes. It is quite certain that, 

•wherever they are placed in the natural system, they are sure to be 
more or less aberrant, and will have to stand, to a great extent, 
alone, as is so often the case with Australian forms of bird-life. 
Their habits seem tome to associate them with the Ground-Thrushes 
and Babblers, of which they will form an outlying group with affinities 
towards the Crows and Paradise-birds.

culmen 1*3, wing 6'2, tail 4*6, tarsus 1*7. 

Young male. Eesembles the female at first, but is generally to be 
distinguished by a few purplish-black feathers appearing on the head 
and back or on the quills. The body-plumes appear to he acquired 
by a direct moult; but the quills and tail-feathers become black by 
a change in the colour of the feather itself. 

The Satin Bower-bird inhabits New South Wales, and ranges 
throughout Eastern Australia as far as Eockingham Bay and Port 
Denison.

391 

Very similar to 0. mamlata, but altogether darker above, and having 
the hind neck of the same dark brown as the back, with smaller 
tawny-buff spots; the under surface of the body is also darker. 
Total length 12 inches, culmen 1-05, wing 5-6, tail 4-25, tarsus 1-6. 

The head of the male, collected by Mr. Stuart during his travels 
into the interior of Australia, likewise points to the present species 
being distinct from C. maculata. The lilac band is much richer in 
tint, and the head shows the whole of the feathers with silvery tips, 
instead of only a few thus marked as in 0. mamlata. The feathers 
of the hind neck resemble those of the female, and seem to indicate 
that the species has no band of earthy brown between the nape and 
the mantle as in its near ally. 

The Large-spotted Bower-bird, as far as is known, appears to be 
confined to the interior of Australia, and to the north-west portion 

of the continent.

Adult Above brown, all the feathers edged with ashy, giving a 
greyish shade to the upper parts, nearly uniform on the hind neck ; 
crown of head, feathers above the eyes, and lores thickly but 
minutely dotted with triangular spots of buffy white; the whole of 
the back, scapulars, and wing-coverts distinctly streaked down the 
shaft with buffy white, dilating into a triangular spot at the tip, all 
the apical markings much larger and whiter on the wing-coverts, 
the primary-coverts edged with whitish near the tip; quills brown, 
externally washed with greyish, the secondaries tipped with white, 
forming a large spot at the tip of the innermost; rump and upper 
tail-coverts streaked like the back, but slightly more tinged with 
fulvous ; tail-feathers brown, washed with greyish along the edge 
of the outer webs and tipped with white; entire sides of face and 
throat ashy brown, thickly streaked everywhere with light fawn-
buff, all the feathers being mesially streaked with this colour; 
chest fawn-buff, mottled with ashy brown, with which colour the 
feathers are edged and slightly barred; all the rest of the under 
surface of the body clear fawn-colour, the flanks indistinctly mottled 
with indications of ashy-brown bars ,• sides of the upper breast 
brown, broadly streaked down the centre with fulvous; under wing-
coverts fawn, like the underparts, the outermost of the greater 
series ashy brown, with pale fulvous bases, the lower surface of the 
quills light brown, edged with pale fulvous along the inner web ; 
bill black; legs grey; iris black. Total length 11*3 inches, culmen 
1*1, wing 5*65, tail 4*91, tarsus 1/7. 

Ols. These birds vary a good deal, the spotting on the back being 
much less in some than in others ; those which have it less developed 
have nearly the entire head and neck uniform, only the fore 
part of the crown being spotted. Whether these ar younger birds 
I am unable to say. 

The Fawn-breasted Bower-bird inhabits the Cape York Peninsula 
and the islands of Torres Straits, as well as South-eastern New 
G-uinea in the neighbourhood of Port Moresby.

I have not been able to find this locality in any map; but the 
skins still bear Griffith's original label, and are marked in the same 
way as his Afghanistan skins usually are. I believe, therefore, that 
the locality is somewhere in Afghanistan; and if this turns out to 
be the case, the westward range of the species will be much extended.

The Loango Buibul has been recently described by Prof. Bocage 
from two specimens procured on the Loango coast by MM. Lucan 
and Petit. Though these birds were apparently not fully adult, the 
species -would seem to be new to science. It belongs to the group 
of X scandens.

Andropadus minor, Bocage, Jom. Zish. viii. p. 55 (IS50). 

General colour olivaceous brown, shaded with maroon on the 

tail, the shafts of the tail-feathers of this latter colour; below the 

tints are paler, inclining to ashy on the throat and washed with 

yellowish on the abdomen; quills brown, edged externally with 

olivaceous brown and internally with greenish yellow ; bill blackish, 

feeble, a little curved, compressed towards the point and having 

three or four distinct denticulations at the end of the upper

Bocage's Bulbul was discovered at Massabe, on the Loango coast, 

by Messrs. Lucan and Petit. The type is in the Lisbon Museum, 

and I have never seen the species.

As this name has already been employed (cf. P. hcemorrhous, p. 124) 
it cannot stand, and I propose the name of P. salvadorii for the small 
Malayan species.

its colour, but the brown has less of the reddish-brown shade. The 

plumes round the eye, especially on the under and hinder parts, 

white. Behind the eye a broad streak of olive-grey. The markings 

of the wings and tail arc characteristic of the present species ; these 

are throughout barred with black, as in the species of Troglodytes. 

Bill and feet dark. Total length about 5-2 inches, bill from front

The Peruvian Brown Wren was discovered by M. Constantin 

Jelski at Maraynioc in Peru. I have never seen the species.

Upper surface of body and outer aspect of wings ashy grey, more

behind the eye, sides of the head, bend of the wing, lower wing-
coverts, and whole of the belly white, washed with isabelline; 
under tail-coverts transversely banded with black; tail-feathers 
uniform with the back, the lateral ones whitish on their margins, 
all having narrow transverse bars of blackish brown, about ten in 
number; bill and feet blackish horn-colour. Total length 4" 6'"

It should be noted that M. Taczanowski (P. Z. S. 1874, p. 505, 
1880, p. 191) refers to Thryotfioras auclax\ Tschudi, as a true 
Troglodytes. I am still in ignorance as to the affinities of Tschudi's 
species.

Thryothorus cantator, Tacz. P, Z. S. 1874, pp. 130, 504. 

Above cinnamon; the head ashy grey; the back tinged with 
brown; cheeks dull ashy grey; throat white, the breast and belly 
greyish fulvous; quills dusky blackish, edged with cinnamon; tail-
feathers greyish rufous, banded with black; bill blackish, with the 
mandible yellow ; feet and iris brown. Total length 5-9 inches, 
wing 2-8, tail 2*65, tarsus 0-9, bill from gape 0*8. 

Jelski's Wren was discovered in Central Peru by M. Constantin 
Jelski. I have never seen an example; but Taczanowski states 
that the species is close to T coraya, but differs in having no 
streaks on the sides of the face, in the different colour of the head 
and under surface of the body, in the bands on the tail being 
rufous instead of ashy, and in the considerably shorter bill. It is 
apparently closely allied to the bird I have called in this volume
