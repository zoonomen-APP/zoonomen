On comparison it does not appear that there is any difference 

about the head, as the brilliant blue feathers entirely ^ cover the 

head of the male of both species ; but L. minor, besides being 

much smaller, may be distinguished by the white on the two middle 

tail-feathers reaching nearly to the tip, while in L. victorias^ the 

white does not go so far towards the tip, so that the Mack tip is

The only specimen of the female that I hare seen marked "by a 
collector is If r. Everett's Bnitulu skin; and this does not seem 
to me to be adult. In Capt. Wardlaw Ramsay's collection is a specimen 
from Borneo, received from Yerreaux, and marked as a female, 
which ^differs from the adult male only in its paler coloration and 
in having the ashy throat lighter in shade and not extending so far 
onto the chest. This is probably the only difference between the 

Young female (Bintulu). Differs from the male in being brown 
above, with a slightly rufescent forehead; wing-coverts like the 
back, tipped with pale orange-buff, as also are the inner secondaries 
; quill* dark brown, externally margined with lighter brown ; 
rump and upper tail-coverts bright orange-rufous; tail-feathers 
bright chestnut, tipped with pale rufous and crossed near the end 
with a broad black band, the outer feather also blackish along 
the outer web, and the centre feathers having also the entire inner 
web blackish; lores bufiy white, slightly tinged with rufous; 
round the eye a ring of rufous feathers; ear-coverts dusky brown, 
streaked with pale rufous; cheeks light rufescent, slightly mottled 
with dusky bases to the feathers; throat dull white, washed with 
rufous, a little purer white on the fore neck; breast and sides of 
body light orange-rufous, including the thighs and under tail-coverts; 
centre of breast and abdomen whiter; under wing-coverts pale 
rufescent, the axillaries slightly yellower; quills ashy brown below, 
greyish white along the edge of the inner web ; " bill dark brown; 
gape yellow; legs pinky white; iris dark brown" (A. Everett), 
Total length 7'2 inches, culmen 0-9, wing 3*55, tail 3*2, tarsus 
1-1. 

As mentioned above, this female is probably not quite adult, as 
in other specimens the blackish inner web on the centre tail-feathers 
is not so apparent, and does not extend for the whole length of the 
feather; the throat and fore neck also are mottled with dusky 
margins to the feathers, and the bill is seemingly paler in immature 
birds. 

A younger bird is browner above than the foregoing, with the 
forehead rufous and the wing-coverts tipped with rufous-buff; lores 
and feathers round the eye rufescent; ear-coverts dusky, streaked 
with rufous; under surface of body light rufous, the lower breast 
and abdomen white.

rufous; quills and tail-feathers brown, more or less fringed with 
bluish grey ; feet blackish; iris brown.

Ohs. The above descriptions are taken from M. Grandidier's work. 
I have never seen a specimen, and do not know if the species rightly 
belongs here or to Pseudocossyjphus (vide antea). The mode of 
coloration of the sexes and the habits of the bird are quite peculiar; 
and it may belong to a totally distinct genus.

caused by the sudden appearance of the bases to the feathers ; lores, 
eyebrow, sides of face, and entire under surface of body orange,

blackish on the inner web; quills dull brown, externally shaded 
with grey, the secondaries with a further external border of pale

slate-coloured; iris dark brown. Total length 6*4 inches, culmen 

1*7, wing 3-25, tail 3, tarsus 1. 

Ohs. The -variation in the colour of the back, which is always 

seen in a series of specimens of this species, seems to me to depend 

upon season, the birds gradually becoming much more blue on the 

back and wings, and losing the orange-coloured margins to the 

feathers ; the centre tail-feathers become black, and not brown as in 

the Natal specimen described. As the brighter-plumaged birds 

come from "West Africa, it is possible that a more richly coloured 

race occurs on the west coast; or perhaps they may be in the summer 

or winter plumage. 

Hab. South-eastern Africa from Natal to the Zambesi, and ex


tending as high as Mombas and Malindi: on the west coast it 

occurs from Loanga to Benguela.

on some of the dorsal feathers; scapulars and lower back rather 
inclining to reddish olive, the latter shading off into bright orange 
on the rump and upper tail-coverts; wings dark brown, the coverts 
broadly margined with bluish grey, and having a more or less 
distinct spot of white at the tip o£ the outer ones; the primaries 
externally washed with ashy, the secondaries with olive-brown; 
two centre tail-feathers dark brown, the remainder bright orange, 
the outermost brown on the outer web, all the others also brown 
towards the tip of the outer web ; a broad white eyebrow; lores, 
feathers round the eye, and ear-coverts black ; cheeks, throat, and 
chest bright orange; sides of neck bluish grey; rest of under surface 
pale slaty grey, inclining to white on the centre of the abdomep.; 
flanks washed with orange, especially towards the under tail-
coverts, which are entirely of the latter colour ; thighs grey; under 
wing-coverts pale yellowish orange, the outermost grey, narrowly 
edged with white ; bill black; legs black ; iris dark brown. Total 
length 7*2 inches, culmen 0-6, wing 3*65, tail 3'8, tarsus 1-25. 

Adult female. Similar to the male. 

Ohs. The example described has been selected on account of its 
bright plumage; the others are everywhere much duller in colour, 
and it is probable that in winter the plumage is more obscure. 

Young. Speckled all over, the feathers of the upper surface being

* Dr. Reichenow (J. f. O. 1882, p. 212) in writing about a series of Black 
Chat-Thrushes sent by Dr. Bohm from the country "below Lake Tanganyika, 
suggests that T. shelleyi and T. arnotti are members of one and the same species, 
the oldest name for which is Thamnolaa nigra (Vieillot), founded on 
Levaillant's plate. The latter has always been held to be unrecognizable ; nor 
have I myself ever seen any birds agreeing with it. Not having examined the 
specimens which are in the Berlin Museum, I can only give Dr. Eeichenow's 
opinion, which, if correct, will add the following synonymy to the species :— 
Le Traquet Commancleur, Levaill. Ois. dAfr. iv. p. 114, pi. 189 (1805) ; 

Sundev. Krit. om Levaill p. 37 (1857). 

(Enanthe nigra, Vieill. K Diet. d'Hist. Nat xxi. p. 431 (1818). 

Sylvia nigra, Bonn, et Vieill. Enc. Meth. ii. p. 489 (1823). 

Saxicola nigra, Gray, Gen. B. i. p. 179 (1846). 

Myrmecocichla nigra, Bp. Consp. i. p. 302 (1850). 

Br. Reichenowfurther considers the species from " ^Equatorial West Africa" 
distinct from the eastern bird which I name T. shelleyi; and he names it Myrmecocichla 
levaillantii (with ' Le Traquet Commandeur' of Levaillant as a 
synonym). I must confess that in the absence of a good series of specimens I 
am unable to make out the difference between the eastern and western birds; 
but I would remark that the name of Sylvia nigra of Vieillot is founded on the 
"Traquet Commandeur" of Levaillant, and that therefore, if the latter is 
really a distinct species, it would bear the name of Thamnolcea nigra in preference 
to that of T. levaillantii.

Adult \_female~\. Entirely glossy black above and below, with the 
exception of tbe wing-coverts, which form a conspicuous white patch, 
the lesser and median series being pure white, some of the latter 
tipped with black, and the greater inner coverts of the series white 
at the base; in front of the eye a few white feathers *; quills 
dusky below, browner along the edge of the inner web ; " iris chestnut" 
(AncMeta). Total length 6*5 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 3*85, 
tail 2-35, tarsus 1*25. 

Professor Barboza du Bocage describes as an adult male a bird 
exactly like the above, but having a pronounced superciliary streak 
from the base of the bill to behind the eye. This is like the type 
figured in the ' Ibis ' (I. c), which has the eyebrow extended to the 
end of the ear-coverts, and some of the feathers of the crown spotted 
with white, from which it would appear that one sex at least, at 
some time of its life, gets a pure white head.

Adult male. General colour above glossy blue-black, with a large 

white wing-spot formed by the lesser wing-coverts; the median and

dusky brown, externally edged with ashy "brown; quillis dusky 
brown, externally edged with lighter brown, the secondaries with 
an obscure blue gloss; upper tail-coverts glossy blue-black; tail-
feathers black, edged with blue-black ; lores dusky, surmounted by 
a thin line of fulvous; feathors round the eye fulvous; ear-coverts 
reddish brown, with fulvous shaft-streaks ; cheeks and under surface 
of body ashy brown, darker on the abdomen, sides of body, and 
flanks; thighs light brown; under tail-coverts chestnut; under

quills ashy brown below, inner edges lighter. Total length 0 inches, 
culmen 0-6, wing 2*75, tail 2-05, tarsus 0*95. 

This species seems to have a winter plumage, as specimens often 
have the black feathers of the upper surface edged with brown, 
which gives a browner aspect to the upper parts. These birds may 
belong, on the other hand, to the intermediate race, between this 
species and T. cambaiensis, mentioned by Mr. Hume. 

Young. Entirely sooty brown above and below, with lighter brown 
margins to the feathers ; wing-coverts sooty brown, with reddish-
brown edgings; upper tail-coverts black; quills and tail black, the 
latter glossy; under tail-coverts ferruginous.

The geographical distribution of the Dhayal birds is of great 

interest: and m gradual is the transition of one supposed species to 

the other, and so uncertain are the characters for their specific 

separation, that 1 have dcemrd it be^t to recognize but a single actual

from the Indo-Malayan bird by its pure white axillaries, and by Its 

generally having three outside tail-feathers white and the fourth for 

a great extent white also. In. the Indo-Malayan Dhayal the 

axillaries have very conspicuous blackish bases, so that in most 

the prevailing colour of the axillaries is black with a broad white 

margin; the two outer tail-feathers are white, the third has a 

broad black basal mark on the inner web, while the fourth has only 

a white patch at the tip. These markings are not sufficiently con


stant, however, to render identification always an absolute certainty, 

though the axillaries are, as a rule, easily recognizable In the two 

species. In the In do-Malayan birds the females are darker as 

regards the throat 
and chest, and there is a more decided rufous 

tinge on the flanks. The females of the Indian birds, however, 

vary somewhat in tint, those from the Himalayas being paler, while 

Southern-Indian skins, and Ceylonese ones also, are appreciably-

darker and approach Malayan examples in colour. 

The range of the true O. saularis extends all over India and 

Ceylon eastwards to Assam and as far south as Pegu. I have only 

seen one female bird in poor condition fromTenasserlm, and. c amoi say 

whether it is 0. saularis, which descends to Tenasserim, or C. t*w*icn$, 

which comes up there from the Malayan peninsula. The latter 

species is the Dhayal of Siam and Cochin China, whence it extends 

down the Malayan peninsula to Sumatra and Java, and also retches 

Borneo. In the two last-named islands it meets the black C, anicenus; 

and specimens are 
in the Museum which appear to me to be un


doubted hybrids between the two forms.

In breeding plumage the feathers become much worn, and the fore 
neck and breast are thickly covered with narrow blackish streaks; 
the white ends to the tail-feathers are also greatly abraded. 

A bird obtained by Mr. Atmore still shows traces of immature 
plumage in the shape of whitish endings to the dorsal feathers and 
upper tail-coverts, the outermost of which have a subterminal black 
spot, before the white tip; the markings are otherwise as in the 
adult, but the black streaks on the under surface are not so numerous. 

Hab. Southern and South-eastern Africa. Erom the Kaysna to 
the south-eastern districts of the Cape Colony and British CafFraria, 
ranging through the Transvaal into the Mashoona country : said to 
have been obtained by Eornasini in Mozambique; but the species 
may have been E. zambesiana from this locality.

It has a brown head, and not a grey one as would appear from 
the figure given by Eiippell and from the description given by 
Heuglin of E. leucoptera from Abyssinia; it would be necessary 
to compare a typical example of the latter species before a 
satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at with regard to the 
Zanzibar bird. The ^"di specimen is very closely allied to my 
K ruf cauda; but the latter has the upper back brown, and not so

mandible yellow; legs dusky yellowish white; iris pinkish grey" 

(R. G. W. R.); upper and half the lower mandible black; rest of 
lower mandible, legs, feet, and claws fleshy yellow; iris greyish 
brown (W. Davison), Total length 7*2 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 3, 
tail 3*1, tarsus 0*95. (Mus. R. G. Wardlaw Ra?nsay.) 
Sexes alike in plumage. A female measured ;—Length 7*25, bill 
from gape 0*8, wing 3, tail 3, tarsus 0*92 (Hume). 

The present species replaces the foregoing in the hills of Karen-
nee and Tenasserim. It is not very distinct from the last-named 
bird, some examples of which are almost as dark as L. saturata. 
The fulvous margins to the lesser wing-coverts may be the remains 
of young plumage and become grey in the old bird, in which case 
the Karen species could scarcely be separated from the Sikkim bird.

Adult male. General colour above glossy purplish black, as well 
as the throat and fore neck; ramp and upper tail-coverts pure 
white ; wings and tail black, much duller than the rest of the back, 
the four outer tail-feathers tipped with white, in creasing in extent 
towards the outermost, which is white with a black base; ^ remainder 
of under surface of body deep chestnut; thighs whitish; under 
wing-coverts chestnut like the breast, the edge of the wing purplish 
black, the lower coverts whitish with narrow ashy-brown 
edgings; lower surface of quills ashy brown, much paler towards 
the base of the inner web ; " bill black; iris dark brown; legs and 
feet fleshy white" (W.Davison), or fleshy pink (Eugene W. Oates) ; 
" eyelids plumbeous; inside of mouth fleshy" (E. W. 0.). Total 
length 11 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 3*65, tail 7, tarsus 1*05, 

Adult female. Quite different from the male, with a much shorter 
tail; upper surface, as well as the throat, olive-brown more or less 
tinged with grey ; rump white ; quills brown, edged, as well as the 
wing-coverts, with fawn-brown ; under surface of body pale rufons 
fawn-colour, inclining to white on the abdomen, and much paler 
on the under wing-coverts. Total length 7*8 inches, culmen 0*7, 
wing 3*45, tail 4-4, tarsus 1. 

If judged by the females alone, the Tenasserim birds would appear 
to belong to a different race from the Indian, as the hen birds are 
so very much darker; and the Malaccan birds are also very darkcoloured, 
while in Java the hen seems to be as dark as the male. 
See my note on G. suavis (infra, p. 87). 

Young. Similar to the old female, but mottled all over with, 
ochreous-buff spots edged with dusky ; head streaked with ochreons

Adult female. Similarly coloured to the male, except that the 
plumage is a trifle duller; size smaller. Total length 8*2 inches,

Obs. The large series from Borneo at present in the Museum 
enables me to state that, although the majority of the specimens 
have the white outer tail-feathers which induced Dr. Sclater to 
separate the Banjermassing birds as* C. suavis, yet some of the 

8b 
miELllD-33. 

Bornean specimens exhibit a distinct blackish shade at the base of 
the outer tail-feathers, and in this respect resemble Sumatran skins. 
One of the chief differences, however, between C. suavis of Borneo 
and 0. tricolor consists in the very dark colour of the female bird; 

and I should consider this of more direct importance were it not 
evident that a greater darkness of coloration in the female of G. tricolor 
is gradually evident as the Burmese countries are reached, and is also 
seen in examples from the Malay Peninsula. In Java, the female 
birds are apparently so dark-coloured as almost to resemble the males ; 
and hence we have three races:— 

1. 
C. tricolor from India, extending through the Burmese 
countries down the Malayan Peninsula. 
2. 
C. tricolor from Java, with a black base to the outer tail-
feathers, and the female like the male but with a shorter tail. 
3. 
0. suaviSy with the sexes as in the last, but with very little 
or no black .base to the outer tail-feather. 
The chief character of the Bornean bird called by Dr. Sclater C. 
suavis was the pure white outer tail-feather; but this is a character 
which Latham gives to his " Long-tailed Thrush " from Pulo Conclore, 
an island lying off the coast of Cochin China; for neither in description 
or figure is any thing said about a black base to the outer tail-
feather. Until specimens from Pulo Condore are examined and 
found to be absolutely the same as C. mavis of Borneo, I think it 
better to drop Latham's name, because it is almost certain that 
Siamese and Pulo-Condore skins will be the ordinary C. tricolor, 
and in that case the description and figure given by Latham would 
prove to be inaccurate. It would then be inconvenient to allow the 
name of macrurus (with its white outer tail-feather) to stand for 
the common Shama, when there is a Bornean race or subspecies 
which possesses the white tail-feather, but yet was not the bird examined 
by Latham.

Group II. RRABYPTERL 

These birds are aberrant Keed-Warblers, and should, in my 
opinion, be placed in future classifications of the Cichlomorph© 
near the genera Oeitia and Acrocejohalus, from which they are separated 
by their larger first primary only. Through Megalurus and 
Sphenceacus they approach the Grass-Warblers and Cisticolce especially.

sides of the fore neck and chest some small blackish streaks, more 
developed on the sides of the breast, and much more so on the 
flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts, which are somewhat more richly 
coloured; under wing-coverts and axillaries uniform fulvous ; quills

Considerable difference in the amount of striping on the sides of 
the body is shown in a series; and the head is much more uniform 
rufous in some specimens than in others. Young birds are like the 
adult, but are much lighter in colour, being yellow, especially on 
the hind neck and mantle ; the under surface is uniform yellowish 
buff, with scarcely any dusky striping on the sides.

" Back, shoulders, and flanks dark brown; wings and tail of a 
slightly richer and more rufous-brown, tho tail-feathers in some 
lights seeming to bo transversely marked with faint, glossy, transverse, 
narrow bands of a slightly lighter shade; crown, napo, and 
ear-covcrts rich chestnut or rufous-brown; a triangular spot in 
front of, and slightly over each eyo, and tho throat, greyish white ; 
feathers of the breast lunulatod, greyish white at their margins, 
dull brownish like tho flanks at their baso ; the greyish white extonds 
in a narrow track along the middle of the abdomen; legs, 
feet, upper part and tip of the bill dull brown ; lateral parts of the 
upper mandible and the basal portion of the lower one yellowish; 
legs 7" 9'", bill from gape 9|'", from forehead 7'", wings 3" 4£'", 
tail 4" 10'", tarsus 1" 2'". The great length of the wing, tarsi, and 
bill easily distinguish this species from the two previously known, 
as well as the rufous head and ears, and the greyish white instead 
of buff colour over the front of the eye. I am uncertain what 
value should be attached to the much darker and stronger lunulation 
of the breast-feathers, as I have only seen one specimen, and 
am not certain whether it has attained maturity. The bill is 
stronger, being deeper as well as longor, and slightly more arched 
in the culmen than in the 8. brachyptera, to which it is most nearly 
allied. The sixth primary is also slightly longer than the fifth and 
seventh, which are equal; the claws are rather stouter than in that 
species, and the three or four large rietal bristles are weaker. The 
specimen described was presented to the Museum by Mr. Broadbent, 
who shot it in December 1858, in a dense scrub twenty-four miles 
from Portland Bay, while it was uttering a note like that of an 
English Thrush, and running over logs on the ground. I have not 
since seen another specimen." (McCoy, I. c.)

All the upper surface dark brown, each feather with a narrow 
stripe of white down the centre; under surface the same, but 
much paler ; flanks and under surface of the shoulder rust-red ; tail 
dark brown, indistinctly barred with a still darker hue and edged 
with pale brown; irides reddish hazel; base of lower mandible bluish 
horn-colour, remainder of bill black; feet flesh-brown. {Gould, I. e.) 

The male I dissected was destitute of the rusty-red colouring on 
the flanks and under surface of the shoulder. (Gould, I. c.) 

The unfortunate omission by the late Mr. Gould of giving measurements 
of Australian birds with his descriptions has made several 
identifications of his species very difficult. In the present instance 
the dimensions would have been of great service in recognizing the 
species of Amytis; and I am by no means certain that I have rightly 
interpreted Mr. Gould's species as figured in his ' Birds of Australia.' 
If, however, I am correct in my identifications, then Amytis ma-
crura is scarcely separable from A. textilis, of which it is a slightly 
larger and paler representative.

Adult. Similar to B. hraofajpterus, but browner, and not so rufous 
on the upper parts ; underneath, the fore neck, breast, and sides of 
body are brown, the centre of the breast and abdomen are white, 
and the throat is dull white obscured by brown tips to the feathers, 
producing a mottled appearance. One of the chief distinguishing 
characters is to be seen in the under tail-coverts, which are light 
brown, broadly margined with pale yellowish white, whereas in 

B. brachypterus the under tail-coverts are uniform rufescent brown, 
of the same colour as the flanks. Total length d-5 inches, culmen

Ellisia, Hartlaiib, J.f. 0. I860, p. 92. E. typica. 
Range. Confined to Madagascar. 

Messrs. Milne-Edwards and Grandidier, in their great work on 
the Natural History of Madagascar, enter at some length into the 
question of Ellisia typica and its races. They point out that in 
Madagascar the fauna of the eastern part of the island, where the 
country is mountainous and the climate wet, is different from that 
of the lower and dryer western side, and that variations in the 
plumage of Ellisia take place according to locality; three forms are 
recognizable; but, as intermediate specimens occur, Grandidier concludes 
that they cannot be reckoned as species, but merely as races. 
I follow him in the present work; but have to state that E. lantzi 
occurs in Ankafana along with true E. tyjyica.

Group III. EEEMOMELM. 

The birds included in this group are entirely African, and in 
general aspect and mode of life are related to the true Warblers, 
from which they cannot be widely separated; on the other hand, the 
heavier bill and large first primary also indicate affinities with the 
true Timeliidae.

Female Total length 5 inches, culmen 0-55, wing 1 *95, tail 2*05,

In breeding-plumage the general aspect of the bird is greyer 
above, with scarcely any of the olive-green shade, while underneath 
the colour is-dull white, the yellow tinge being almost lost. 

Young birds have the head olive-green like the back, and show 
the breast-band much narrower than in the adults. The birds from 
Macamac have all green heads, and, being shot at different times of 
the year, are probably constant in this respect, in which case they 
would belong to a distinct species.

Bamara Land is the only place from which I have seen specimens 
with the breast black, and the head and nape entirely slaty blue. 
In males from Iiingwiiliamstown the hinder crown and nape are 
olive-yellow like the back, and only the forehead and sinciput 
grey. The sides of the crown and sides of nape, however, are 
tinged with grey, a slight appearance of which is also seen on 
the back part of the nape, indicating apparently that the bird is in 
a somewhat transitional stage of plumage. It will be noticed that 
all the specimens from the more southern localities bear the dates 
of June and July, while the Bamara birds were killed between 
November and May. It appears, then, that the breeding-place of 
the species is Bamara Land, and that it goes south in winter, when 
the plumage resembles that of the old hen-bird, with the hinder 
crown and nape like the back.

Adult male. Above brown, family darker in the centre of the 
feathers, the upper tail-coverts somewhat washed with fulvous; scapulars 
slightly shaded with ashy, the lesser and median wing-coverts 
clearly edged with ashy grey, the greater coverts and the quills 
brown, washed with reddish brown, the margins of the quills rufescent, 
inclining to whitish; tail-feathers brown, waved with dusky 
cross lines and margined with yellowish brown, without any dark 
sub terminal bars to the feathers; head and nape uniform rufous; 
lores buff, extending backwards over the eye and forming a faint 
eyebrow; sides of face grey, shaded with fulvous on the upper and 
hinder margin of the ear-coverts; entire under surface of body ashy 
grey, whitish on the chin and malar line; centre of abdomen and 
vent also whitish, the under tail-coverts very pale yellowish; under 
wing-eoverts buffy whitish, slightly washed with fulvous near the 
edge of the wing, the lower series ashy brown like the lower surface 
of the quills, which are edged with light rufous along the inner web; 
*' upper mandible light brown; lower one pale; tarsi and feet pale; 
iris light yellowish brown" (T. Ay res). Total length 4*3 inches, 
culmen 0*45, wing 1*9, tail 1*85, tarsus 0*75. 

Adult female. Similar to the male, but rather smaller and not so 
brightly coloured. Total length 3*5 inches, culmen 0*4, wing 1*7, 
tail 1-5, tarsus 0-75. 

Young. Differs from the adult in having the under mandible 
much yellower, the upper surface being uniform brown, the head 
slightly more reddish brown than the back. Under surface of body 
very pale ashy, throat and abdomen whiter, the fore neck slightly 
tinged with yellow. 

Birds in winter plumage, and young after their first moult, from 
the Transvaal, differ in wanting the grey shade underneath, the 
under surface of the body being yellowish buff, a little lighter on 
the throat and abdomen. On tho upper surface the general colour 
is brown, as in the full-plumaged bird, and the rufous head is equally 
well pronounced. In the winter plumage this species is very similar 
to Cistieola aberraus ; but in the latter bird the tail is always 
longer than the wing, and its feathers are rather pointed. 

Hab. South Africa, from the Knysna district eastwards to Natal, 
and thence through the Transvaal to Northern Damara Land.

Young male. Differs from the adult in having the bill duller, and 
in having the eyebrow and entire throat and cheeks tawny like the 
rest of the under surface. 

Eour out of our five specimens have white cheeks and chins, as well 
as a white eyebrow, and are apparently in the plumage described by 
Eeichenow as Sylviella leucopsis. The yellow tinge on the belly 
and the paler bills of these birds seem to indicate that they are 
young, and at any rate I cannot believe that they are in entirely 
perfect plumage, as the white eyebrow is tinged with rufous in two 
of them ; one of the typical specimens of Troglodytes micrurus 
received from Dr. Eiippell is also in this white-faced plumage.

* Dr. Peters having sent me several rare African Warblers for examination, 
I find that the specimen collected by Dr. Fischer in Zanzibar and recorded above 
as <7. olivacea, Sund., is not the C. olwacea of Sundevall, but ?sthe true C. olivacea 
(Y.)=C. hrachyura auct. The Berlin specimen is mounted, and the plumage 
about the eye is disturbed, so that I cannot make out for certain whether the 
eyebrow is present as in the S.-African bird; but otherwise they seem to be identical.

Group IT. G1STIGGLJS. 

The Grass-Warblers form a tolerably -well-defined group, the 
genera being all rather closely connected together, with the exception 
of the Australian genera Acanthiza and Sericomis, which show 
in their general form an affinity with the Willow-Warblers (Phylloscopi). 
The genus Gramimcola and some of the larger Gisticolce 
connect the group with some of the Bradyj)teri, such as Megalurus 
and Ghcstomis (vide supra, pp. 122, 130); and Buya also inclines 
towards Bradyjpterus, JJromceocercus, etc. The genus Burnesia resembles 
the Tailorbirds in its leaf-sewing propensities; and some of 
the latter, separated by me under a distinct generic heading, lead on 
naturally to the aberrant Jfuscicapidce, such as Gryjptolqpka, etc.

Adult. General colour above dull brown, -with a slight olive tint, 
the feathers margined with greyish olive, causing a somewhat 
mottled appearance : lower back and rump more uniform; wing-
coverts brown, with greyish-olive edges, the outer coverts of the 
lesser series margined with yellowish white, as also the bastard wing 
and primary-coverts; quills brown, with hoary olive margins, rufescent 
towards the base of the primaries; upper tail-coverts and 
tail-feathers dark brown, with hoary olive margins and tips, before 
the latter a dusky brown subterminal spot; crown of the head 
like the back, and mottled in the same manner; lores yellowish; 
no eyebrow; ear-coverts and cheeks yellowish buff, the former 
dusky along their upper margins; throat and under surface 
yellowish buff; sides of the breast brown, or mottled with dark-
brown bases to the feathers; abdomen a little clearer yellowish 
buff; sides of the body and flanks light olivaceous ; thighs a little 
more tawny like the abdomen; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
light tawny ; quills below brown, inner edge of quills pale tawny 
buff; "bill black; tarsus fleshy; claws brown and dusky; iris 
straw-yellow or golden yellow " (Scully). Total length 5*8 inches, 
culmen 0*6, wing 2*1, tail 3, tarsus 0-8. 

The bird described is in breeding-plumage ($. fuliginosa, Moore), 
when, as shown by Mr. Hume (Str. P. 1878, vol. ii. p. 2), the " bill 
is entirely black ; the head and upper back are duller and duskier 
brown, the pale striae faded to greyish, very much reduced in width, 
often almost obsolete; the quills margined writh pale, faintly rufescent 
olivaceous; eyebrow none.5' 

In the non-breeding plumage, according to the same observer, the 
bill is brown above, the greater part of the lower mandible pale 
yellowish or pinkish horny ; the head and upper back rich, more or 
less rufescent, and more or less deep brown, conspicuously striated 
with pale, more or less rufescent fawn or yellowish brown; the 
quills margined with bright ferruginous (growing duller month by 
month) ; the sugercilium small and inconspicuous, creamy. 

1 . STJYA. 179 
The autumn plumage of the young birds differs a good deal from 
both the above. The striations of the head and back are less defined 
than in the mid-winter plumage, the pale portions being more 
rufescent and darker-coloured• and the lower surface is much tinged, 
as a rule, with dull yellow, though, as in the specimens described as 

S. jparumstriata^ this is wanting. (Hume, 1. c.) 
Young female (type of Suya obscura, Hume). General colour 
above brown, with dusky centres to the feathers of the head and 
back, causing a mottled appearance, less distinct on the back• rump 
uniform brown; lesser and median wing-coverts like the back; 
greater coverts, bastard wing, primary-coverts, and quills light brown, 
with reddish-buff margins to the feathers, more distinctly rufous on 
the outer edge of the primaries ; upper tail-coverts darker brown; 
tail-feathers brown, with dusky cross bars under certain lights, the 
edges and tips paler and more fulvous-brown, the tips plainer on 
all but the two centie tail-feathers and having a distinct subterminal 
spot of dusky brown; lores dull whitish, obscured by blackish 
tips; no distinct eyebrow, but the superciliary feathers a little paler 
than the crown; eyelid whitish; ear-coverts light brown, washed 
with yellowish buff; cheeks, throat, fore neck, and chest buffy 
whitish; breast and abdomen pure white; sides of the breast washed 
with olive-brown; sides of the body, flanks, thighs, and under tail-
coverts clear fulvous-brown ; under wing-coverts and axillaries pale 
tawny buff, whiter near the edge of the wing• quills below ashy 
brown ; inner edge of quills pale tawny. Total length 5-9 inches, 
culmen 0*45, wing 2*15, tail 2*8, tarsus 0*85. 

Nestling. Reddish brown above, nearly uniform, the head only 
streaked with darker brown; ear-coverts, cheeks, and throat yellowish 
white, tinged with fulvous on the abdomen; sides of body and 
flanks ruddy brown; a faint eyebrow • quills broadly edged with 
rufous. 

The plumage of the full-grown young birds is very similar to the 
nestling plumage, but the yellow tint disappears, leaving the under 
surface whiter. Buy a obscura of Hume is founded on a young bird 
in first autumn plumage. 

The young in its first winter dress is very distinctly striated above, 
and is tinged strongly with grey above and with fulvous below. 

Blanfordius siriatulus of Hume appears to me to be only a young 
bird in its first winter dress * and our specimen is not to be separated 
from a Bootan skin collected by Pemberton.

Mr. Hume remarks (Str. F. 1878, vol. ii. p. 4) that 8. Jchasiana 
goes through precisely the same stages of plumage as $. atrigularis. 
" In the non-breeding jplumage the bill is paler; it has a conspicuous 
white supereilium; its lores are white; chin, throat, and upper 
breast nearly pure white, a little creamy ; no mandibular stripes ; 
clear ochraceous brown ear-coverts; and forehead, crown, and occiput 
clear rufous, and back only slightly browner; tail-feathers much 
broader and unabraded." 
It, too, has an intermediate stage, in which the breast-feathers 
show very narrow black lateral margins, in which the red of the 
head is somewhat duller, and in which there is a dark spot before 
the 
eye. (Hume, Z. o.)

slightly more rufous on the outer margins; bastard wing dusky, 
narrowly edged with whitish on the outer web ; primary-coverts and

tail 2*7, tarsus 0*85. (21m. F. Nicholson.) 

The specimen described has been lent to me by Mr. P. Nicholson, 
and agrees with Mr. Hume's description of S. albicans. More 
recently Mr. Hume (Str. P. 1880, p. 227) has united the Sumatran 
species with Suya superciliaris of Anderson, in which identification 
1 cannot follow him. S. albigularis may have, to judge from analogy, 
a black-throated breeding-dress ; but in its nonbreeding-dress it is 
very distinct from the Burmese S. svpercilians^ which never has 
a grey head. I am uncertain as to the range of the species, as Mr. 
Hume, after comparing his Sumatran type with examples from 
Mooleyit (previously identified as S. superciliaris in Str. P. vol. i. 

p. 350), pronounces the two birds to be " clearly identical/" If this 
is the case, the Sumatran bird probably ranges along the mountains 
of the eastern side of the Malayan Peninsula up to Mooleyit in 
Tenasserim. I should have thought, however, that Mr. Hume was 
right in his first identification, and that it is the Burmese bird 
which ranges as far as Mooleyit, and not the Sumatran which goes 
so far northwards.

Adult female. General colour above uniform brown; wing-coverts 
like the back; bastard wing and primary-coverts dusky, externally 
margined with yellowish white; quills dusky brown, externally fulvous-
brown ; the secondaries a little more rufous; upper tail-coverts 
like the back, with a slight rufous tinge on the outer ones; tail-
feathers brown with fulvescent margins; crown of the head darker 
than the back, of an ashy-olive colour; lores blackish, surmounted 
by a narrow white eyebrow ; feathers round the eye also whitish; 
ear-coverts dull ashy brown, with whitish shaft-lines; throat and 
breast light yellowish buff, the abdomen whiter; on the breast a few 
black margins to some of the feathers ; sides of the body, flanks, 
thighs, and under tail-coverts tawny buff; under wing-coverts and 
axiliaries very pale tawny buff, whiter along the edge of the wing; 
quills below brown; inner edge of quills light rufous; "upper 
mandible black, lower mandible fleshy pink; legs, feet, and claws 
fleshy pink ; iris brownish yellow " (Davison). Total length 7 inches, 
oilmen 0-5, wing 1-85, tail 3*8, tarsus 0-85. 

The type of S. erythropleura, Walden, is a male, and measures as 
follows :—Total length 7-4 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 1*95, tail 4*4, 
tarsus 0*9 (Mus. It G. Wardlaw Ramsay). It is identical with S. 
supe re Maris. 

I was at one time inclined to think that the present species might 
be the cold-weather dress of S.Jchasiana; but the latter species always 
has a rufous head. Whether it is a stage of plumage of S. albigularu 
can only be made out from a larger series of specimens.

A bird in young or winter plumage differs from the specimen 
described in being more uniform olive-brown above, the head being 
brown and not grey; the yellow on the abdomen is paler and the 
chest has no grey band across it. A Sumatran ^crimen U similar 
to the adult, but has not the grey chest-band ; this difference may 
be sexual.

rather rufous-brown; tail pale brown, with dusky obsolete bars 
across it, very indistinct, no darker sub terminal spots, the feathers 
having only rather lighter edges ; wings dark brown, the coverts 
edged with ashy fulvous ; edge of the wing and the margins of the 
bastard-wing plumes whitish ; quills externally edged with rufous-
brown, lighter towards their tips; lores and feathers over the eye 
dull white; cheeks and ear-coverts also dull white, the latter 
brownish on their hinder margins ; throat white; across the breast 
a broad band of dark brown ; rest of under surface pale yellow ; 
thighs tawny ; under wing-coverts pale tawny buff; the quills ashy 
brown below, edged with rufous along the inner webs; "bill jet-
black ; legs and toes flesh-colour; iris brownish yellow " (Andersson). 
Total length 5*7 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2*05, tail 2*8, 
tarsus 0*8. 

The adult female, as determined by Sir Andrew Smith, has 
not so broad a black pectoral band, but is otherwise similar to the 
male, 

Obs. The variation in the black pectoral band of this species has 
given rise to much inquiry as to whether it is a seasonal plumage 
or a sign of age. Sir Andrew Smith expressly states that the 
young birds want the black band; and this is no doubt correct. 
The large series which I have examined show the following facts, 
viz. that birds killed between April 19th and July 8th exhibit no 
sign of tne pectoral band, while those killed towards the end of 
July (18th and 30th) show a slight trace of it; on the other hand, 
very faint remains of dusky markings are to be seen on examples 
killed on the 12th and 16th of April as well as on one procured 
on the 1st of September, while the band is most pronounced in 
a bird shot on the 27th of March. All these dated specimens were 
collected by that admirable naturalist the late Mr. C. J. Andersson ; 
and they suggest that the black pectoral band is part of the summer 
plumage, as it seems to be appearing in the July-killed specimens and 
to be disappearing in those killed in the middle of April. All the 
specimens shot between April and the early part of July are in good 
plumage, and are perhaps young birds in their first winter livery; 
they seem to have longer tails than the breeding birds, and their 
colours are much richer, the general tone of the upper surface 

188

being rather rufescent when compared with the black-collared 

specimens, the head being decidedly rufous, as also are the margins to 

the wing-feathers. A slight disparity is noticed in the size of the 

sexes, as will be seen 
by the accompanying measurements of a pair 

killed by Andersson 
at Sand Fountain. Walvisch Bay, April 19th,

Adult male. Above dull earthy brown, the wings a little darker 
than the back, with indistinct rufous-brown margins to the quills, 
the primaries narrowly edged with whity brown; tail-feathers light 
brown, with pale whitish tips but no subterminal bar of black; lores 
yellowish white, as also a distinct eyebrow; cheeks and sides of face 
pale yellowish, with distinct triangular spots of black obscuring the 
yellow of the ear-coverts, which are also brown on their hinder 
margin ; under surface of body pale yellowish, with distinct longitudinal 
spots of black, larger on the breast and smaller on the 
throat and on the sides of the body, which are washed with pale 
tawny brown; the abdomen unstreaked pale yellow; thighs dull 
tawny; the under tail-coverts also pale tawny brown, with indistinct 
darker centres ; axiUaries and under wing-coverts light tawny buff, 
the lower series ashy brown at the tips like the lower surface of the 
quills, which are edged with pale rufous along the inner web ; 
bill flesh-colour, shading into dark brown on the upper mandible and 
the tips of the lower one; legs flesh-colour; iris brownish yellow. 
Total length 5 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2, tail 2*75, tarsus 0*85. 

I have not seen an adult female of this species ; but she will 
doubtless be found to be a little smaller than the male. 

Young. More rufous-brown than the adult; quills dusky brown, 
edged with rufous-brown; underneath pale yellowish, with broad 
mesial streaks of brown on the throat and breast. 

190 roiELinxas. 

The young bird after the first moult still keeps a more rufous 
appearance than the adult bird, and ha& a longer tail (34 inches). 
The newly moulted tail-feathers have a slight dusky subtenninal 
bar.

rump slightly washed with olive; wings brown, duller than the 
back, with paler edgings to the feather^, the primaries narrowly 
margined with whity brown ; tail light brown, waved across with 
dusky under certain lights, the feathers narrowly tipped with white, 
with a faint indication of a subterminal blackish bar; lores and a 
very distinct eyebrow, as well as a circlet of feathers round the eye, 
pale yellow; a few plumes between the eye and the base of bill 
dusky brown, as also the upper margin of the ear-coverts; rc&t of 
the sides of the face and throat lemon-yellow, entirely spotted; 
rest of under surface of body yellow, unspotted on the abdomen, but 
distinctly streaked with black clown the chest and on the sides of 
the body; flanks washed with yellowish brown; thighs and under 
tail-coverts tawny buff; under wing-coverts also tawny buff, the 
edge of the wing white ; quills brown below, the inner web edged 
with tawny rufous; bill black; legs flesh-colour; iris light brown. 
Total length 5*3 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2*1, tail 2*7? tarsus 
0*9. 

2. PEINIA. 191 
Adult female. Similar to the male, but smaller. Total length 
4*7 inches, culmen 0*5, -wing 1*95, tail 2-2, tarsus 0*85. 

Ohs. The description is taken from a pair of "birds in Captain 
Shelley7s collection, obtained by Mr. T. L. Ayres near Pinetown, 
Natal, on the 19th of January, 1875. The female had the soft 
parts coloured as in the male, and both appear to have been breeding, 
from the worn plumage. 

Birds shot in June 1870 near Eland's Post by Mr. T. 0. Atmore, 
and apparently in full winter plumage, are of a warmer brown above, 
with clearer tawny colour on the flanks. 

Young birds have much broader streaks of black on the breast, 
and have the cheeks and sides of face also minutely streaked with 
black. The tail in the winter plumage of the young seems also 
longer than in the breeding-dress, owing somewhat to the less worn 
appearance of the tail. A male measures :—Total length 6 inches, 
culmen 0*5, wing 2'05, tail 3*5, tarsus 0*9. 

I was at one time inclined to think that this species might turn out 
to be only the winter plumage of P. maculosa or* P. suhstriata * but 
after seeing the series in the British Museum and in Capt. Shelley's 
collection, I think there can be no doubt of its being quite distinct 
from either of the above birds, and it must be considered an eastern 
representative of P. maculosa, 

A young female killed by Major Butler near Newcastle, on the 
9th of June 1881, is evidently in its first and newly-moulted winter 
plumage. It has broader streaks on the breast, but is especially 
remarkable for the ruddy tinge on the flanks and underparts, for 
the warmer brown of the upper surface, and for the distinct subterminal 
dark spots on the tail, which measures 3*4 inches. 

Hah. Replaces P. maculosa in S.E. Africa from the neighbourhood 
of Grahamstown into Natal and the Transvaal.

Adult. General colour above smoky brown, tbe boad and nape a 
little more dusky than the back, the rump and upper tail-coverts 
clearer and more rufous-brown ; quills dark brown, edged with ashy 
brown on the lesser coverts, and with reddish brown on the median 
and greater series ; primary-coverts and quills dark brown, with pale 
reddish-brown edges, more fulveseent on the primaries; tail-feathers 
light brown, with dusky cross bars under certain lights, margins 
paler brown, all but the two centre feathers narrowly tipped with 
whitish, before which is a very distinct bar of black; lores white, 
extending above the eye; in front of the latter a dusky spot; cheeks 
and ear-coverts yellowish white, spotted with dusky; ear-coverts 
dark ashy along the upper margin; under surface of body yellowish 
buff, whiter on the throat and abdomen; sides of breast ashy grey, 
flanks rather more fulvous; thighs dull tawny; under tail-coverts 

2 . PTtlNIA 193 
yellowish; under wing-coverts and axillaries light tawny, lighter on 
edge of wing; quills dusky below, rufescent along the inner webs. 
Total length 4*6 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 2, tail 2*05, tardus 0*8. 

The South-African bird is a little larger than the West-African. 
The present species is scarcely separable from the Indian P. inomata; 
but has apparently a less uniform upper surface, the lower back and 
rump being washed with reddish brown. 

Ohs. There can, I think, be no doubt that P. affinis is only the 
winter plumage of P. melanorliyuclia. The black colour of the bill 
of the latter is not specific, but gradually assumed. Thus specimens 
killed in Damara Land in May begin to show the approach of a 
black bill, while most of the other birds killed in that country have 
a light reddish-brown bill. The species breeds in Natal, the specimens 
obtained near Pinetown by Mr. T. L. Ayres being in worn 
breeding-plumage, with the edges of the tail completely abraded. 
Young birds collected by the same gentleman resemble the winter 
plumage, but the males have black bills, the females brown. 

The greatest difference between the winter and summer plumage 
of the birds seems to be in the rufous edgings to the, wing-coverts; 
and at one time I thought that it would show thatfthere were two 
species, but I have since examined breeding birds with remains of 
rufous margins on the feathers. The young birds have this rufous 
largely developed on the wing, and, as in many other species, have 
longer tails. The following are the measurements of a series from 
South Africa:—

Young in first winter plumage (type of D. bivittata, Peters). 
General colour above brown, slightly washed with rufous; rump 
decidedly more fulvescent; lesser wing-coverts like the back; 
median and greater coverts dusky brown, edged with dull rufous; 
bastard-wing feathers dusky, margined with paler rufous ; primary-
coverts and quills dusky brown, externally edged with rufous, 
brighter on the outer web of the primaries; upper tail-coverts and 
tail-feathers rufous-brown, more rufous on the edges of the feathers, 
which are tipped with paler rufous, with a tolerably distinct bar of 
dusky blackish; crown of head rather more dusky than the back, 
indistinctly streaked with lighter brown; lores and a tolerably 
distinct eyebrow whitish, the hinder margin of the latter ashy; 
feathers round the eye buffy whitish; ear-coverts buffy whitish, 
browner on the upper margin; cheeks, throat, and fore neck whitish, 
slightly washed with fulvous; chest and remainder of the under 
surface faint yellowish buff, inclining to tawny buff on the sides of 
the body and flanks; thighs rufous; abdomen a little whiter; under 
tail-coverts fulvescent; under wing-coverts and axillaries fulvescent, 
inclining to rufous on the lower series; quills dusky brown 
below, inner edges rufescent. Total length 5-3 inches, culmen 0*5, 
wing 1*9, tail 2*6, tarsus 0*75. (Mus. Berol.) 

A specimen in the British Museum from Tete measures :—Total 

length 4-5 inches, culmen 0-5, wing 1-75, tail 2*35, tarsus 0*8. It 

agrees very well with the type of D. hivittata, kindly lent me by 

Professor Peters, but is much smaller, being perhaps a female; the 

colours are paler and the head not so dusky, but more like the rest

of the back, and the underparts are yellowish, white, with fulvous 
flanks and rufous sides. In the stage of plumage above described 
the birds are identical with Prima mystacea of Riippell, which has 
also been recorded by Jardine from Western Africa. Drymoeea 
melanorhyncha from Western Africa is identical with South-African 
specimens from Natal, and it follows that the young birds from 
Western Africa would be in the plumage of P. mystacea; hence 
Jardine and Eraser were perfectly right in speaking of the latter 
bird as West-African, though their statement has been somewhat 
discredited by recent authors.

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour above greyish, 
brown, with slight indications of dusky centres to the feathers; 

2. PKOTA. 
ruinp and upper tail-coverts more uniform brown, the latter slightly 
paler; wing-coverts brown, edged with ashy brown; primary-
coverts and quills dusky brown, with narrow rufous-brown edges, 
paler and more ashy on the primaries; inner secondaries margined 
with fulvous-brown; tail-feathers light brown, with dusky cross bars 
under certain lights ; all but the centre feathers white at the tip, with 
a more or less distinct subterminal bar of blackish; inner web also 
more or less whitish towards the tip; lores and a very distinct eyebrow 
white; cheeks and ear-coverts whitish also, with the upper 
margin of the latter brown ; under surface of body pale yellowish buff, 
whiter on the throat; thighs tawny rufous ; sides of upper breast 
ashy; axillaries and under wing-coverts yellowish white, with a slight 
tawny tinge; quills dark brown, rufescent along the inner web• 
" bill all black; legs and feet pale yellowish fleshy• iris hazel-brown " 

(W. E. Brooks). Total length 5-2 inches, culmen 0-45, wing 2*05, 
tail 2*3, tarsus 0*8. 
Adult female hi breeding^plumage. Similar to the male but 

smaEer. Total length 4*6 inches, culmen 0*4, wing 1*9, tail 2-15, 

tarsus 0*8. 

The winter plumage is rather more rufescent brown above than 
the summer dress, and rather more yellow below ; the rufous edgings 
to the quills are also more conspicuous, and the tail is longer, 
measuring 2*7 to 2-8 inches, and there is no white on it, the feathers 
being tipped with ashy with a black subterminal spot, more distinct 
when viewed from below. 

The young after their first moult are mach more rufous than the 
adult bird, especially on the edges of the quills and tail-feathers ; the 
under surface is also a much richer fulvous; the tail-feathers are 
tipped with fulvous and have little or no indication of the subterminal 
band. 

Mr. Hume has given a very full account of the changes of plumage 
of this species (' Stray Feathers/ 1876, p. 427) ; and Mr. Brooks's 
paper in i Stray Feathers,' 1878, vol. ii. p. 468, should be consulted. 
Mr. Hume seems inclined to consider the South-Indian bird distinct 
from the ^"orth-Indian species, and he proposes to keep Hodgson's 
name of fusca for the latter species, which is figured in Hodgson's 
drawings, Appendix, plate 14 (no. S88). This name would belong 
properly to the Himalayan bird, if it were really distinct. 

The Chinese and Burmese "Wren-Warblers, called Drymceoa extensicauda 
by Swinhoe and D. Uanfordi by Walden respectively, both 
of which supposed species are recognized by Mr. E. W. Oates as 
occurring in Pegu, are really scarcely separable; the lores are a 
little more fulvous than in P. inornata, and, as far as the specimens 
have been examined, there appears to be a little less white on the 
tail of the breeding bird in the Burmese race. The winter plumage 
also has rather a longer tail • but there is really nothing of any 
consequence to separate these species from P. inornata. 

Hal. The whole of India and Ceylon, ranging westwards into 
Scmde, and eastwards through Assam and the Burmese countries

Adult male in breeding-plumage. General colour above dark 
brown, a little paler on the lower back and rump; the bead and 
bind neck distinctly different to the back, and of a dusky ash-brown; 
lesser and median wing-coverts dark brown, with ashy margins; 
scapulars also dark brown washed with ashy; greater coverts brown, 
with reddish-brown margins; bastard-wing feathers dusky, edged 
with ashy; quills brown, edged with reddish brown, inner secondaries 
a little more ashy on margins; upper tail-coverts and centre 
tail-feathers pale reddish brown, crossed with obscure dusky bars 
in certain lights, the next feathers brown along the outer web, 
white on the inner; this white on the inner web is more or less 
shaded with pale sooty brown, diminishing in extent towards the 
outer feathers of the tail, the external tail-feather being almost entirely 
white; lores dull white; no eyebrow; ear-coverts dusky brown, 
with obscure yellowish shaft-lines; cheeks and under surface of 
body yellowish white, pure white on the abdomen; sides of upper 
breast ashy; flanks fulvescent; thighs tawny brown; under tail-
coverts pale yellowish white; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
very pale tawny; quills ashy brown below, rufescent along inner 
web. Total length 6*3 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2-55, tail 2-85, 
tarsus 0*9. 

Winter plumage. Differs from the breeding-dress in having the 
head brown like the back, but especially in the tail, which has no 
white on the inner web, but, on the contrary, has the external 

2. MOTIA.. 
201 
feathers tipped with white, with a tolerably distinct subterminal 

bar of black. 

In this stage of plumage it is P. robusta and P. valida of authors ; 

but in the series collected by Mr. Brooks at Mnddapoor, and forming 

part of the Oates collection now in the Museum, is a bird killed on the 

21st of August, 1879, which is moulting from the worn breeding-

plumage of P. neglecta into the winter dress. In the latter stage of 

plumage it is also the P. sylvatica of Jerdon and P. jerdoni of Blyth, 

specimens of both of which species are in the Museum, the former 

still bearing labels in Jerdon's handwriting. 

The young bird resembles the winter plumage of the adult, and 

has a similar tail, but is rather more ruddy on the flanks and sides 

of breast; the upper surface also is more rufescent. Both the 

young specimens collected by Mr. Brooks in November 1879 are 

commencing to moult, and are putting on the rufous head, which 

gives an indication of what the young bird in its first full winter 

plumage will be like. "We have no specimens identified as D. ru~ 

fescens of Hume; but there can be little doubt from the description 

that the latter name belongs to this stage of plumage; and it is 

equally certain that Bvya gaagetka of Jerdon also belongs here, as 

the type was in the Gould Collection, and is now before me. 

As in most of the Grass-Warblers, the tail is considerably longer 

in winter plumage, and measures 3*3 inches in length. 

Prom an examination of Jerdon's specimens of P. sylvatica it 
would appear that the white on the fail-feathers of the breeding 
bird is gradually assumed by a partial change in the colour of the 
feather; but that some of the white tail-feathers are gained by a 
direct moult there can be no doubt, as a Mnddapoor specimen, shot 
by Brooks on the 15th of May, is moulting its tail from the winter 
to the summer dress.

^wf t maZe. General colour above olive-green, becoming slightly 
more yellow on the rump ; le&ser wing-coverts and median coverts 
like tie back; greater coverts, bastard wing, piimary-eoverts and 
quills brown, edged with olive, a little browner on the secondaries; 
upper tail-coverts rathei lighter olive than the back; tail-feathers 
light brown, with olive-} eUowish raarjrin«, paler and more \ellow 
round the tips, before which is an indistinct indication ot a dark 
brown spot; occiput, nape, and hind neck dark olive; lorei> and 
feathers round the e} e dusky ash-grey ; ear-coverts dark ash) grey; 
cheeks, throat, fore neck, and chest yellowish white ; breast and 
abdomen bright yellow, sides of the body and flanks a little deeper 
coloured ; thighs olive-brown; under tail-coverts pile yellow : under 
wing-coverts and axillaries pale yellow : quills light brown below, 
inner edges whitish, rufescent on the secondaries. Total length 
5*4 inches, culmen 0-55, wing l#b, tail 2*7, tardus ^"85. 

Female. Very similar in plumage to the male, but smaller- Total 
length 4*6 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 1 7, tail 2%>5, tarsus O-b. 

A male killed in Singapore on the 8th of February, by Mr. Davison, 
differs from the bird described in having a distinct streak above 
the lores and the eyelid white ; the subterminal dark spots are also 
well developed and distinct; these last apparently form a variable 
character, as they seem to get abraded with the age oi the bird's 
plumage. The white superciliary streak appears to be a sign of 
winter plumage. 

Yoimg, Wants the grey head of the adult, the upper surface being 
entirely olive-yellowish, tinged with reddish on the back, and having 
the head a little duller; the outer aspect of the wings also a little 
more reddish brown; a distinct line above the eye and the eyelid 
yellow, and the entire under surface of body, from ehin to vent, 
yellow; tail-feathers tipped with yellow, before which are very distinct 
subterminal marks of dark brown. 

The young in first tvinter plumage may be described as like the 
adult bird, but having a long tail, and a tinge of reddish buff on

the throat and breast. The spotted tail, characteristic of the young 
bird, seems to be retained in the first full winter dress; and it is a 
bird in this plumage which the late Lord Tweeddale described as 
Prinia raffiesi, but which (thanks to the kindness of Capt. Wardlaw 
Ramsay in lending me the type) I am able to affirm is not specifically 
separable from P. flaviventris; the larger bill, supposed to be a 
distinguishing character of P. rafflesi, is equalled by more than one 
Pegu specimen.

The sexes and dates of specimens in the British Museum and in 
Capt. Wardlaw Eamsay's collection are not sufficiently well determined 
to enable me to speak with positive certainty on the changes 
of plumage of B. socialis; but, as far as our series goes, my impression 
is that B. stewarti of Indian authors is only the winter 
plumage of B. socialis. If they are ever proved to be two species, 
then they must interbreed; for there is an absolute gradation 
in plumage from one to the other. But, from what we know of 
these Grass-Warblers, there is nothing extraordinary in the supposition 
that B. stewarti is B. sotialis in winter dress. It is said to differ 
in being reddish brown above instead of slaty grey, and in having a 
long brown tail, measuring 3 inches in length. This may probably 
be the young bird in its first winter plumage. The old bird in its 
cold-weather plumage still retains somewhat of the grey head, 
though the back is reddish brown. A male killed in December has 
the tail 2-3 inches. 

The young bird is rufous-brown above, a little more dusky on the 
head, the rump and upper tail-coverts brighter rufous; tail-feathers 
rufous-brown, tipped with fulvous-white, with a distinct subterminal 
bar of black; a superciliary streak and the under surface of the 
body deep ochraeeous bnff. 

The colour of the adults in this species varies somewhat with 
locality, and the size also. Birds from Nepal and Assam seem to be 
of a darker slate-colour, sometimes almost blackish. Capt. Legge's 
Ceylonese race cannot be kept distinct, as the measurements are not 
smaller than Indian specimens, if sufficient skins are examined. A 
Ceylon female measures 4*6 inches, wing 1*8, tail 1-95, tarsus 0*8. 
Another bird has the tail 2*15, another 1*6; and a male measures 
1-8. To determine these questions it is necessary to compare only 
specimens of a similar age, in breeding- or cold-weather plumage, and 
to judge the question in accordance with our recently acquired 
knowledge on the Grass-Warblers. 

With regard to the identity of B. socialis and B. stewarti, I may 
further mention that the male from Saharunpoor, shot on the 9th 
August, is slaty blue above and has no eyebrow, whereas some

"With reference to the distinctness of this species from B. lepida, 
it should be noted that even in Egypt Oapt. Shelley observed two 
forms, a light and a dark-coloured one, the latter being found in the 
Delta, while the other occurs in Nubia and Upper Egypt. (Cf.

" In one of my specimens the streaks on the chin and throat are 
altogether wanting; the central tail-feathers are pretty conspicuously 
margined with greyish brown, and both the lateral feathers 
on each side are tipped with white, in some specimens the external 
pair being pretty broadly so tipped. The foEowing are dimensions

pale brown, the feathers edged with the same green as the back, 
the primaries with paler brown; tail olive-brown with greener 
margins to the feathers, which are tipped with yellowish, having,

In Ceylonese lairds the soft parts axe given by Capt. Vincent 
Legge as follows:—"Iris pale reddish; eyelid rufescent yellow; 
bill fleshy, with dusky culmen; legs and feet fleshy reddish or 
flesh-eolour.'7 Dr. Jerdon had an idea that the Tailorbirds from 
Ceylon were different from Indian specimens; but Capt, Legge 
carefully went into the subject in his ' Birds of Ceylon/ and found 
certain slight differences, but not enough to constitute specific 
characters. See his remarks (t c. p. 518). 

Adult female. Very similar to the male in plumage, but smaller 
and with a shorter tail, the two centre tail-feathers not being 
produced. Total length 3*8 inches, cuimen 0*55, wing 1*65, tail 
1*25, tarsus 0*75. 

Young. Yery like the adult female, but with the head entirely 
dull rufous, the general plumage more fluffy, the upper tail-coverts 
rufescent. 

Hah. Occurs throughout India and Ceylon, both on the hills and in 
the plains, breeding in both situations and ranging as high as from 
3000 to 4000 feet. WestTv ards it extends into Scinde, and eastwards 
through the Burmese countries to South China, where it occurs 
from Canton to Foochow, as well as in the Chinese islands of 
Formosa and Hainan. Mr. Blyth also gave the range of this bird 
as extending to Singapore; but this wants confirmation, and the 
Malayan species is no doubt O. maeuJieolIis.

Adult male. General colour above yellowish green, the wings 
dark "brown, all the feathers edged with the same colour as the back, 
the edge of the wing bright lemon-yellow ; upper tail-coverts brighter 
and more yellowish green than the back; tail-feathers dull brown, 
shaded with green and edged with yellowish green, the tips pale yellow, 
but with no subterminal dark bar; crown of head light bay, as well 
as the feathers round the eye; ear-coverts uniform ashy whitish; 
cheeks and throat dull white, somewhat mottled with black, where 
the bases show through; lower throat entirely Mack, forming a large 
patch, the plumes of the lower part of which are longitudinally 
streaked with silky white; rest of under surface of body silky white, 
washed with grey on the sides of the upper breast, the sides of the 
body dull greenish, the under tail-coverts pale yellow, thighs yellowish 
tawny; under wing-coverts pale yellow, the lower ones 
white; under surface of quills pale brown, edged with whitish along 
the inner web; bill in skin pale brown, the under mandible lighter 
and more yellow; legs dark brown, the toes much paler. Total 
length 4-2 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 1*75, tail 1*65, tarsus 0*75. 

The birds which I take to be the adidt female of this species 
agree in most respects with the male, but want the black throat. 
The tail-feathers also show a very distinct subterminal bar of blackish 
brown, which is scarcely visible in the males. I am disposed, however, 
to consider this character of small importance, as it seems not 
only to vary in individuals from the same locality, but even to depend 
somewhat on the fresh state of the feather. A female from 
Malacca (Wallace; mus* Jl Gould) measures as follows—Total 
length 3*5 inches, ctilmen 0*6, wing 1-5, tail 1*45, tarsus 0*7. 

§ 9>

A specimen marked " by Mr. Davison, collected at Slang in 

Salangore, has some black on the fore neck; but as none of the others 

except Mr. Inglis's Dilkoosha specimen have any black on the fore 

neck, there may have been some mistake in sexing the specimen. 

The last-named specimen is more ashy black, and not such a deep 

black on the throat as in Bornean and Malaccan examples • the chest 

has several longitudinal drops of white, very distinctly pronounced. 

The same ashy blackish shade is perceptible in Mr. Oates's Pegu 

specimens.

Adult male (type of species). General colour above olive-green; 
wing-coverts and quills dark brown, all the feathers broadly edged 
with the same colour as the back, the greater coverts margined and 
tipped with brighter yellow; tail dark brown, narrowly tipped with 
brighter yellow, but without any darker subterminal bar; head 
dark ashy grey, the lores fulvescent; sides of face and a malar stripe 
blackish grey ; ear-coverts white ; chin and sides of tipper throat 
white; centre of throat and jugulum black, forming a large patch ; 
fore neck, sides of body, flanks, under tail-coverts, and thighs bright 
olive-green, the latter slightly tinged rufous; under wing-coverts 
yellowish, the edge of the wing bright yellow ; " iris light hazel" 

(J. B. Steere). Total length 5 inches, culmen 0-65, wing 1*85, tail 
1-9, tarsus 0*9. (Mus. J. B. Steere.) 
Capt. Wardlaw Eamsay has kindly lent me the pair of birds shot 
at Zamboanga by Mr. A. Everett. The female agrees in plumage 
with the type; but the male has the lores, sides of face, and entire 
throat black, leaving only the ear-coverts white. The head is 
slightly washed with blackish, showing an approach to 0. nigriceps. 
Total length 5 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 1*85, tail 2-15, tarsus 
0*9. The measurements agree almost exactly with those of the type. 
The female collected by Mr. Everett, which answers in plumage to 
the typical specimen, measures—total length 4*7 inches, culmen 
0-65, wing 1-8, tail 1*7, tarsus 0*8.

and primary-coverts blackish brown, tipped and edged with, lighter 
yellow; quills dark brown, externally edged with yellow, brighter on 
inner secondaries and inclining to yellowish white at tip; upper 
tail-coverts rather browner, washed with olive-yellow; tail-feathers 
brown, narrowly edged with olive-yellow; crown of head, occiput, 
and nape black; lores, eyebrow, and feathers round the eye white; 
the hinder eyelid a little mixed with blackish ; ear-coverts black, 
mottled with white near the eye; cheeks white, narrowly edged 
with black; throat, fore neck, and breast white, mottled with black 
bases; abdomen yellowish white ; sides of body, flanks, and under 
tail-coverts olive-yellow; thighs somewhat washed with tawny; 
under wing-coverts and axillaries olive-yellow, with dusky brown 
bases ; edge of wing bright yellow; quills below brown; inner edge 
of quills paler; "bill black, mandible white; legs pale brownish; 
iris clay-brown " (A. Everett). Total length 4*6 inches, culmen 0*6, 
wing 1*7, tail 1*5, tarsus 0*85. 

The type specimen appears to me to be not thoroughly mature, 
as the throat in full-plumaged birds is doubtless entirely black as 
in 0. cinerezcejjs. The black head, however, is a character which is 
very strongly pronounced, and seems to point it out as a very distinct 
species.

Adult male. General colour above clear ashy grey; the crown 

sides of head, including the cheeks, ear-coverts, and chin bright 

cinnamon-rufous, the hinder crown and occiput gradually shading 

off into brown as they approach the hind neck; throat, neck and 

undcrparts generally ashy grey; the centre of the abdomen and 

under tail-coverts pure white ; thighs deep cinnamon-rufous ; under 

wing-coverts washed with rufous, as also is the edge of the wino-• 

lower surface of quills dark brown, edged along the inner web with 

rufous white; wings above brown, somewhat washed with olive 

and not so grey as the back, the primaries narrowly edged with 

whity brown; tail light brown, with paler brown margins the 

outer feathers tipped with white, before which is a tolerably distinct 

subterminal bar of dark brown; bill in skin light horn-brown the 

under mandible paler and more yellowish; "legs pale warm 

brown ; iris naples yellow " (A. Everett). Total length 4*7 inches 

culmen 0*55, wing 1*85, tail 1-75, tarsus 0-75. ; 

Female. Differs from the adult male in being white below, without 

the grey throat, although indications of the latter are generally 

seen in the greyish shade more or less observable on the lower 

throat and sides of breast. The cinnamon-colour of the chin is also 

difficult to trace, being so faintly pronounced. 

Obs. In my opinion 0. bomeonensis, Salvad., is the fully adult 

male, and 0. cineraceus the female of the present species. The 

only female in the Museum, so determined by dissection is a 

Lombock skin of Mr. Wallace's, and this is whitish below- both 

grey- and white-breasted birds have also occurred together in the 

Bornean collections of Mr. Motley (Banjermassing) and Mr. Hu^h 

Low (M . Borneo). I feel the more certain, therefore, that the 

white-breasted birds are adult females, and not young birds as 

we have specimens of the latter in the Museum from Banjermassin* 

and they are different from the adult, resembling much more 0. sep mm 

in appearance. r 

Young. General colour above olive-brown; quills brown, exter


nally washed with olive-green; tail brown, tipped obscurely with 

whity brown, with a subterminal shade of black, scarcely forming 

a spot; ear-coverts pale rufescent; under surface of body dull 

yellowish white, the thighs obscure fawn-colour; centre of the 

body pale yellowish, the sides of the breast and flanks obscurely 

washed with greenish. y 

Hab. The islands of Sumatra and Borneo, extending also into 
the Malayan peninsula. Count Salvadori considers that the Sumatran 
bird is the same as the Bornean (0. bomeonensis, Salvad.).
agree with Lord Tweeddale, however, that neither can be separated 
from the Malaccan.

Adult male. General colour above dull grass-green; the forehead 
and sides of the head, including the ear-coverts and cheeks, as well 
as the chin pale cinnamon-rufous, the hinder part of the crown 
becoming gradually olive-brown, and shading off into the green of 
the back, causing the bird's neck to have a brownish shade; lower 
throat greyish black, forming a distinct patch; the fore neck and 
sides of neck dull greenish, shading off rather paler on the sides of 
the upper breast, where there are a few narrow white shaft-streaks ; 
rest of under surface of body pale yellowish, the flanks and sides of 
the body washed with green; thighs deep tawny ; under tail-coverts 
yellowish; under wing-coverts white, slightly washed with yellow, 
as also the edge of the wing; quills dark brown, edged with pale 
rufous white along the inner web; wings above dark brown, the 
feathers washed externally with the same green as the back, the 
primary-coverts and primaries outwardly margined with olivaceous; 
tail light, the feathers faintly edged with the same green as the 
back, and narrowly tipped with white, before which is a distinct 
broad subtermmal bar of blackish brown, less pronounced on the 
two centre feathers; " bill and feet pale dusky reddish; iris pale 
olive-brown" (Wallace). Total length 4*8 inches, culmen 0-6, 
wing 1-85, tail 2, tarsus 0*75. 

Young. Differs from the adult in being everywhere paler coloured, 
and in having the black throat-spot only indicated by a few greyish 
"black feathers. 

Obs. Both the birds marked females in the collection want the 
distinct black throat of the old male; but they appear to me to be 
young birds. It is just possible, however, that the old females do 
not have a very distinct patch on the throat, and that in this respect 
the young birds resemble them. The following measurements 
show some variation in the size of the species:—

Adult. Above vinous grey, with a slight tinge of rufous^ the 

lower rump straw-yellow; upper tail-covcrts brick-red; scapulars 

grey like the back; wing-coverts bright brick-red; the quills sepia-

brown, the innermost secondaries paler brown, all the other quills 

externally edged with bright brick-red for about two thirds of their 

length; tail-feathers sepia-brown, with numerous dusky bars under 

certain lights, the middle feathers washed, the remainder edged, with 

rufous, all of them tipped with white, before which is a distinct 

subterminal bar of black; lores, feathers round the eye, and ear-

coverts grey ; cheeks and throat white, rest of the under surface 

bright straw-buff, deeper on the sides of the body, thighs, and 

under tail-coverts; centre of breast and abdomen whitish; under 

wing-coverts buff, the edge of the wings whitish; lower surface of 

the quills ashy brown, edged with rufous along the inner web ; bill 

black; feet yellowish (in skin). Total length 5-2 inches, culmen 

0-6, wing 2-1, tail 2-15, tarsus 0*8. 

Obs. The remains of rufous on the upper surface are probably 

either indications of young or of winter plumage, as one of the three 

specimens examined seems to be moulting from a rufous to a perfectly 

grey back. A female in Captain Shelley's collection, shot by 

him at Accra on the 15th of Pebruary, 1872, seems to be in full 

winter dress, being in the vinous stage, nearly uniform above, with 

the lores and ear-coverts grey. One feature about this bird is the 

7. PHYLLERGATES. 
229 

colour of the upper tail-coverts, which are deep orange-red, not 
brick-red. The type of D. pyrrhoptera, lent me by Dr. Peters 
from the Berlin Museum, is a bird changing from one plumage 
into the other, and has not yet got the brick-red upper tail-coverts 
of the old bird. Tail 2*15 inches. 

The type of 0. rhodoptera of Shelley is, I think, a young bird: 
it is dull ashy brown, dusky on the head and neck, lores and ear-
coverts ; the upper tail-coverts are brown like the back. I have now 
seen six specimens of this species, showing the gradations of plumage 
pretty satisfactorily; and it is not surprising, seeing how the 
bird varies, to find that its different changes have been considered 
to be specific characters.

This genus, which, is allied to the Tailorbirds and Prinice, is 
characterized by its long, pointed and strongly compressed bill, with 
the edge sharp and slightly inflected, not hooked, furnished at the 
"base with some little soft hairs. (The bill recalls that of Aedon 
familiaris; that of Orthotomus is straighter and more compressed; 
these latter birds have, on the other hand, the tail otherwise formed 
and marked with dark spots at the tips of the tail-feathers.) The 
nostrils opening in a linear cleft, with a superior cutaneous membrane 
covered with small feathers; the wings small, with the first 
quill decidedly short, the second strikingly longer, the third nearly 
twice the length of the first, and the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh 
subequal; the tail rather long, narrow and much rounded, wiii 
the tail-feathers decidedly pointed; the feet small and feeble, with 
the tarsus scutellated in front. (Milne-Edwards Sf Grandidier, I. c.)

Bill and tail of Cisticola cisticola. 

Range. Southern Europe and countries bordering the Mediterranean, 
eastwards to India, Ceylon, the Burmese countries and 
China, as well as Japan, the Malayan peninsula, and throughout 
the whole of the Indo-Malayan and Austro-Malayan subregions, the 
Papuan subregion and Australia. The whole of Africa and Madagascar. 


I have examined the types of Heuglin's species of Cisiicolce contained 
in the Museums of Berlin, Stuttgardt, and Yienna, a3 well as 
all the specimens of Grass-Warblers in the collections of Mr. 
Seebohm, Capt. Shelley, and Captain Wardlaw Eamsay ; and I have 
come to the following conclusions respecting the changes of plumage 
in the Cistkolce:—(1) That the male and female are more or less 
different in the breeding-plumage, the tendency being in the male to 
have a uniform head, while the female's is striped ; (2) The female's 
winter plumage resembles her summer dress, but is rather more 
mealy and the tail is longer; (3) A moult takes place in spring and 
autumn, and at tbe latter season the male passes into a winter plumage, 
when he resembles the female ; (4) The young on leaving the 
nest resemble the old female in her winter plumage ; (5) The young 
in their first winter plumage resemble the old female, but have very 
much longer tails and appear larger ; (6) The male is always larger 
than the female. The above points are generally characteristic of 
the genus Cisticola; but there are probably exceptions, especially 
among the plain-backed species, as the plumages of many of these 

have not yet been discovered.

SMrpe $ Bouvier, op. cit. p. 305 (1876); Bocage, Orn. Angola, p. 554 
(1881). 

Above brown, the head indistinctly mottled with darker brown, not distinctly 
streaked; back broadly streaked with black, the feathers with a broad black 
streak down the middle; lower back, rump, and upper tail-coverts ^ more of a 
reddish brown; wings dark brown, the wing-coverts and quills distinctly margined 
externally with rufous ; tail-feathers dark brown, the centre ones edged 
with rufous, the rest tipped with rufous, all with a broad subterminal black

throat and jugulum whitish; remainder of the body below fulvous, the thighs 
brighter buff; sides of the upper breast brownish; under wing-coverts buff; 
bill blackish, the lower mandible pale. Total length 4*25 inches, bill 055, 
wing 1*95, tail 1*6, tarsus 0*75. (Bouvier.) 

Hab. Congo region, West Africa. 

This species, wThich is closely allied to 0. cherina, Smith, cannot be confounded 
with that bird, as it diners in theflanks being entirely buff, in the reddish margins 
of its quills, and in its rufous upper tail-coverts. (Bouvier.)

3 . ClSTICOLA LADOENSIS. 
Cisticola ladoensis, Earth Abhandl. nat. Ver. Bremen, viii. p. 189 (1882). 

Head rufescent, very distinctly spotted with dusky ; the back ashy, with large 
spots of dusky blackish; back unspotted ; scapulars dusky with pale margins ; 
underneath whitish with an ochraceous tinge ; under tail-coverts whitish; under 
wing-coverts isabelline; maxilla horn-colour, the mandible pale ; the quills less 
distinctly edged with rufous. Total length 5'9 inches, culmen 0'45, wing 2'5,

Adult. Gfeneral colour above ashy brown, the nimp shading into 
rufous-brown, the upper tail-coverts dark chestnut; forehead and 
sinciput chestnut, the feathers stiff and pointed, the small plumes 

Similar to C. rufweps, but with the head uniform with the back (not rufous), 

obsoletely streaked with dusky; the bill longer and higher; wings shorter; 

upper tail-coverts pale ashy brown (not rufous); the outer toe shorter. Above 

pale dusky ash-brown; the head streaked with dusky; intei'scapulary region 

and scapulars more conspicuously streaked with smoky black; quills smoky 

brown, the outer web obsoletely paler-margined ; inner secondaries and greater 

wing-coverts smoky blackish, margined with rufous buff; rump whitish; middle 

tail-feathers dusky, slightly washed with rufous, the remainder more dusky 

greyish, marked with blackish before the tip, which is whitish washed with grey; 

under surface of the body buffy whitish, with the lores, throat, and middle of 

the abdomen purer white; the sides of body shaded with fulvous grey; bill fleshy 

horn-colour, the culmen dusky; feet pale fulvous; iris clear brown. Total length 

4f", bill at front 5"2'", wmg 1" ll"f, tail 1" 10"', tarsus 9"'. [Heuglm.) 

One would be led on superficial examination to regard the bird described as 
a somewhat faded young state of J), mficeps, if the difference in the proportion 
of the toes were not observed; for the outer toe is shorter than the inner one, 
while in the other species the contrary proportion occurs. Moreover the vertex 
and nape are not bright ferruginous, but light greyish brown, with narrow, not 
clearly defined, yet tolerably distinct smoky-brown streaks on the shafts; the 
upper tail-coverts and margins of the rectrices are not bright ferruginous, but 
light greyish brown. (Heuglin.) 

Described from a specimen killed on the 6ch February in the country of the 
Kidj negroes on the Bahr el Djebel. (Hmglin^

ear-coverts brown streaked with grey ; wings coloured like the back, with the 
edges of the wing-coverts paler; quills brown, the primaries bordered externally 
with reddish buff and internally with pale isabelHne, the secondaries coloured 
like the back, with paler edges, those nearest the body marked across with more 
or less distinct bars of brown; lower parts dirty white, purer on the throat, 
slightly tinged with buff on the abdomen and under tail-coverts; sides of the 
breast and flanks washed with ashy and brownish; thighs reddish; tail of the 
same colour as the back, moderate, graduated, the two centre tail-feathers of 
the same colour as the back, the others marked with a sab terminal black spot 
and tipped with reddish; bill black, stror-g and curved; feet flesh-colour.

white, as also the throat, which is separated from the cheeks by a 
narrow line of black; rest of under surface of body tawny buff, 
paler on the centre of the abdomen, and very deep tawny on the 
sides of the body and under tail-coverts ; under wing-coverts light 
tawny; wings dark brown, the least wing-coverts externally fulvous-

tion render their non-identity "very probable: the uniform reddish brown tint of 
the back, more brownish on the head, the presence of an auricular spot of brown 
streaked with grey, and the absence of greyish edges to the wing-coverts and 
secondaries, biich are some of the principal differences which we have to point 
out in the coloration of our specimen." (Socage, I. c.) 

6. OlSTICOLA ANGOUJNSIS. 
Dryraoiea angolcnsis, Bocac/e, Jom. Lisb. 1877, p. 160, 1880, p. 56; id. 
Orn. Angola, p. 278 (1881). 

Adult male. Above strongly spotted with brown on a rufous-ashy ground; 

the feathers on the top of the head of a lively rufous with a darker centre; be


low whitish, buff, turning to buff on the abdomen, vent, and under tail-coverts ; 

wing-coverts and quills brown with rufous edges, marked with a black spot near 

the extremity, vUiieh i& reddish white; bill strong and black, the mandible 

yellowish at the base; i'eet clear brown ; iris brown. 

The female U coloured like the male, but is smaller. 

Dimensions are as follow:•— 

$. Total length 5-75 inches, wing 3, tail 245, bill 0*0, tarsus 1*1. 

J . Total length 5 inches, wing 2*45, tail 2, bill 0*55, tarsus 1. 
Hab. Caconda in Bcngucla. 
Obs. This species is close to O. natahnsis and G. curvirobtris; but its bill is 
perceptibly less stout. Thefigure published by Smith of his O. levaillantii gives 
a good idea of the &} stem of coloration in the two specimens ; but they exceed 
by so much the dimensions attributed to the last named species that it is impossible 
to refer them to it. (Bocage, L c.) 

This bird will probably turn out to be G. nataknsis,

Advlt male. Above pale earthy brown, the feathers of the back and scapulars 
showing darker cross bars under certain lights; rump and upper tail-coverts 
inclining to rufous; forehead and ear-coverts ferruginous red, the auricular 
spot streaked with fulvous; lores and feathers round the eye whitish; a narrow 
superciliary streak of pale rufous, not very distinct; lower parts white washed 
with dull rufous, the flanks shaded with brown, the throat and the middle of 
the belly purer white; on each side of the chin a black streak, commencing at 
the base of the lower mandible and forming a moustache; under wing-coverts 
reddish white; wing-coverts reddish brown, more decidedly brown in the 
centre; quills dark brown, edged externally and internally with rufous; two 
centre tail-feathers earthy brown with reddish edges, the rest brown for a small 
basal portion, afterwards black, and ending in reddish white, the outside tail-
feather edged with the latter colour on the external web; bill long, arched, 
and compressed, black for the upper half, the lower mandible dirty white, 
darker at the tip ; tarsi leaden brown, the toes darker in tint. Total length 

7*5-8 inches, wing 3*25, tail 3*85, tarsus 1*05, bill 0*7, (Socage.) 
Hab. Caconda in Benguela. 
The uniform pale earthy brown colour of the back, the presence of the black 
streaks on the sides of the chin, and the leaden brown, almost blackish, colour 
of the tarsi and toes seem to distinguish this species easily from all those 
which approach it in size. (Socage.)

Hob. West Africa, from the Congo district extending into Eenguela. 


Obs. The above description is taken from a female bird procured 
by M. Petit at Ghinchonxo, in the Congo district. I do not know 
where the specimen is now; and I retain the southern Melocichla 
as distinct on the faith of the comparisons I made in 1876, which 
showed that it differed in the grey coloration of the under surface, 
We must wait for additional specimens before finally determining 
whether the Congo bird is really distinct, as Prof. Earboza du Eocage 
believes it to be the same as M. mentalis.

Adult in breeding-plumage. Above nearly uniform ashy brown, 
slightly washed with dull ochraceous; rump and upper tail-coverts 
uniform dull ochraceous ashy; least wing-coverts coloured like the 
back, the rest dark brown, externally margined with dull sandy 
brown, paler towards the tips of the greater series: quills dark 
brown, externally edged with lighter brown; tail nearly uniform 
brown, with a few indications of wavy bars in certain lights, the 
feathers rather paler at tips but without subterminal bars; head 
and nape uniform rufous; lores and a distinct eyebrow yellowish

lines whitish; cheeks, throat, and underparts generally yellowish 

or yellowish white, whiter on the abdomen, the sides of the body 

ashy brown; flanks and thighs pale tawny: under tail-coverts 

fulvous; under wing-coverts tawny buff; upper mandible light 

orange-brown, shaded with deep reddish brown; lower mandible 

straw-yellow ; feet pale reddish yellow. Total length 5*2 inches, 

cnlmen 0-5, wing 1*85, tail 2-o, tarsus 0*35. 

The female is smaller, measuring only 1*75 inch in the wing and 

0*75 in the tarsus. 

In full winter jrtumaye the bird is larger than in summer, the 

wing in the male measuring 2*1 inches, the tail 2*9. The colour 

also is far more olive-ashy above and far more fulvous below, the 

sides of the body ashy; the tail-feathers are also plainly margined 

with fulvous. 

This species bears considerable resemblance to two others, with 

either of which it may be easily confounded. One of these is 

Gist kola ruficapilla of Western Africa, which is distinguished by its 

shorter tail with a distinct black subterminai bar, and by the want 

of an eyebrow. It is not so easy, however, to di*tincmi*h O. aber


rant from the winter plumage of Drmdromas firleioi^ilh*, excepting 

by its long tail (exceeding the wing in length I and by its larger size, 

and especially by its larger bill.

surface; the bill is darker, the upper mandible being blackish. 

The Madras birds seem to be more rufous generally than those 
from Jodpur, Scinde and Sambhur, their general colour being rufescent 
brown, very little lighter on the head.

primary-coverts and quills dusky, externally edged with rufous, very 
distinct at the base of the primaries and forming a wing-patch ; 
inner secondaries dusky brown like the back; upper tail-coverts dusky 
brown; tail-feathers dusky, externally dull rufescent brown, the 
tips lighter and more ashy brown .with a broad subterminal bar of 
black; crown of the head like the back; lores dull whitish; ear-
coverts dusky brown like the head, with whitish shaft-lines; cheeks 
and under surface dull whitish; the sides of the body and flanks 
ashy brown; thighs deep rufous; under tail-coverts fulvescent. 
Total length 5*1 inches, wing 2*o, tail 2*1, tarsus 0*95. 

Obs* The type specimen was never in good condition; and some of 
the characters, such as the axillaries &c, are too much injured to be 
described. The specimens from the Congo, which I believed in 1876 
to be the young of (7. rifioapilla% are evidently immature, or winter-
plumaged birds of the present species. They are lighter rufous above, 
uniform in tint, the wing-coverts and quills broadly edged with deep 
rufous; below, the body is sandy buff, whiter on the throat, fore neck, 
and abdomen; under wing-coverts and axillaries light tawny, the 
latter whitish at the base; quills dusky brown below, rufous along 
the edge of the inner web. One of these specimens shows on the 
head some of the dusky brown feathers of the ad alt plumage.

Adult. General colour above -uniform dark brown, a little more 
reddish brown on the rump and upper tail-coverts; lesser wing-
coverts like the back, some of the outer ones with fulvous margins; 
median and greater coverts, bastard-wing feathers, primary-coverts 
and quills dusky brown, externally edged with rufous, deeper and 
more chestnut on the latter; tail-feathers dusky brown, with rufous-
brown margins, the feathers tipped with lighter brown, before

feathers, which have not a paler tip; crown of the head a little 
darker than the back; lores and a narrow eyebrow whitish, the 
hinder part of the latter slightly washed with rufous; feathers 
round the eye whitish; ear-coverts brown, with narrow whitish 
shaft-lines; cheeks and throat dull whitish ; fore neck and breast 
reddish buff, deeper on the sides of the body and flanks ; abdomen 
whitish; thighs tawny brown; under tail-coverts reddish buff;

inner edge of quills rufous. Total length 3*3 inches, culmen 0*45, 
wing 1*65, tail 1*25, tarsus 0*65. 

This species appears to have a striated stage, when the head and 
back have blackish-brown stripes ; the only example I have seen in 
this stage is a bird killed by the late Governor Ussher at Christiansborg, 
Accra, in December 1879. Whether it is the full winter 
plumage I am unable to say* 

Young. Very similar to the adult, but yellow underneath with 
reddish-brown flanks.

Adult General colour above cindery grey, a little paler on the 
lower "back and rump; lesser wing-coverts light brown; the median 
coverts, greater coverts, bastard wing, and primary-coverts ashy 
brown, margined with light brown; quills dusky brown, externally 
margined with rufous, the inner secondaries more ashy; upper tail-
coverts like the back ; tail-feathers ashy brown, barred across with 
dusky under certain lights, the centre feathers with a blackish subterminal 
mark but no pale tip, all the rest tipped with white, with 
a distinct subterminal bar of black; crown of the head like the 
back; lores dusky, as well as the feathers above the eye; ear-
coverts cindery grey like the head on the upper parts, yellowish 
white on the lower half like the cheeks and throat; fore neck and 
chest cindery grey, forming a broad band across ; breast and abdomen 
yellowish white; sides of the body and flanks slightly tinged with 
ashy; thighs tawny buff; under tail-coverts white; under wing-coverts 
and axillaries yellowish white; quills below brown; inner edge

The young bird differs very little from the adult, but seems to be 
slightly more yellow on the throat. 

Winter plumage. Brown where the summer plumage is grey, but 
without any distinct eyebrow; the rump and upper tail-coverts more 
rufescent; wings with distinct rufous edgings to the coverts and 
quills; tail ashy as in adult, with white tips and subterminal black 
bars; below yellowish, with a strong ashy shade on the sides of the 
body and flanks. Wing 1*85, tail 2-1. 

Captain Legge says that the female is smaller on the average than 
the male; it is less cinereous above, and the wings are paler brown ; 
a light streak above the lores; the pectoral band about the same 
width, but much paler; flanks the same; iris as in the male; 
tarsus not so clear in colour. 

According to the same observer the nestling just fledged has the 
iris olive, the bill dark brown, yellow beneath at the base, the 
legs and feet brownish yellow, the claws light yellowish. The 
colour is brownish olivaceous above, inclining to rusty on the rump ; 
wings brown, edged with light ferruginous; beneath white, a faint 
dark band across the chest, and a slight tinge of buff over the 
whole; edge of wing white. Eor some little time the upper 
parts remain the same; but the pectoral band darkens, the tips 
of the rectrices are whiter than in the adult, and the soft parts 
undergo a gradual change, the iris becomes yellow, the bill 
blackish with a pale base below, and the legs less brownish. At 
the end of the first year the head is cinereous as in the adult, but 

the back is more olivaceous, the wing-coverts and quills still edged 
rusty, and the pectoral band of not quite the normal depth, with 
the "lower part still tinged with buff. During nonage females 
are distinguishable at all ages by the pectoral band being lighter 
than in the male and slightly incomplete in the centre. 

Ilab. India and Ceylon, ranging eastwards into the Burmese 
countries as far south as Pegu.

This species is very closely allied to 0. tmniens^ and requires 
careful comparison with, that species to assure its real distinctness. 
Br. Finsch has suggested that C. marginal is is really the same as 

C. erythrogetiys, Eiipp.; and this accounts for his identification 
of Mr. Jesse's bird above described, which is certainly Heuglin's 
G. marginalise and which appears to me to be easily separable from 
O. erythrogenys, as Heuglin himself has pointed out. I have compared 
Jesse's bird with the type in the Yienna lluseum, kindly lent 
me by Dr. Steindachner.

Adult male (Villacidio, April 26, 1871). Above streaked, the 
feathers blackish in centre, with sandy-buff margins; rump uniform 
rusty ; the feathers of mantle with paler edges ; wing-coverts 
and bastard wing blackish, edged with sandy buff like the back; 
primary-coverts and quills black, with rufous-brown margins, deeper 
near base of primaries; inner secondaries blackish, with'sandybuff 
margins all round; upper tail-coverts rusty fulvous, with 

11 . CISTICOLA. 261 
black longitudinal streaks ; centre tail-feathers brown, with, whitybrown 
margins, remainder dark brown, edged with pale sandy buff, 
the tips white or brownish white with a distinct black sub terminal 
bar: crown of head streaked like back; hind neck a little more 
rufescent than back; lores whitish; a narrow eyebrow and feathers 
round eye sandy buff; ear-coverts pale sandy buff, with whitish 
shaft-lines ; cheeks whitish like the throat; sides of neck decidedly 
more rufous like hind neck; fore neck and breast a pale sandy buff; 
sides of upper breast streaked with darker brown ; abdomen lighter 
and more buffy white; sides of body ferruginous, deepening on flanks 
and tawny on thighs ; under tail-coverts sandy buff; under wing-
coverts and axillaries the same, but a little more rufescent; quills 
below dusky brown, ashy rufous on their inner edge; " bill fleshy, 
the culmen varying from dusky to blackish brown, tip of lower 
mandible dusky; inside of mouth black ; legs and feet fleshy, joints 
of toes dusky ; iris varying from greyish yellow to olive-grey or pale 
olive" (IF. Vincent Legge). Total length 4-1 inches, culmen 0-45, 
wing 2, tail 1-75, tardus 0-75. 

The female is exactly like the male in colour; but the inside of 
the mouth is always fleshy, according to Oapt. Legge. Total length 
4'3 inches, wing 1-8, tail 1*7, tarsus 0*7o. 

To wig. Similar to the adult, but rather -more fluffy and tinged 
with yellow below. In its first autumn plumage it resembles the 
full winter plumage of the adult; but the white tips to the tail-
feathers are not so strongly pronounced; " bill dark horn-colour, 
the under mandible yellowish fleshy; legs and feet fleshy reddish; 
iris greyish olive " { W. V. Legge), 

The series of specimens examined by me from Europe does not 
contain an adult female in the breeding-plumage; and I am not 
able to state the different phases of plumage through which the 
hen passes. As in the case of the 0. exilis group, the male bird 
seems to have a more uniform brown head during the breeding-
season, and as soon as the latter is past he assumes a striped dress. 
The female will probably be found to have a striped head at all 
seasons; and it is evident that in winter the birds are not only 
striped, but have a longer tail than in summt r, as is usual in the 
CisticolcB. Thus a male in breeding-plumage has the tail 1 *25 inch, 
while a male killed in December has the tail 1*85 inch. 

Specimens from the plains of India sometimes present a remarkable 
difference from European specimens in the tail-feathers, which 
have the light subterminal shade of the latter bright tawny instead 
of dull brown. So different does such a specimen as Mr. Brooks's 
Muddapoor skin (vide infra) look, that few would hesitate to separate 
it as a distinct species; but I find that, although this tawny spot 
is never seen in European skins, yet it often occurs in Indian ones, 
and is present also in some of the West-African birds in a varying 
degree of intensity. Thus it is not possible to make it a specific 
character; and it is probably remains of some older plumage (when 
the species was not so widely spread as it is now) which snrvivo 
still in full force in the Indian plains, but has become obliterated in 

TIMELIID^. 

the European birds, and has become nearly so in those from West 
Africa. 
The birds from Japan appear to me to represent a permanently 
large race, with the wing ranging from 2 to 2-2 inches. Too 
much stress, however, cannot be laid on the^e differences, as all the 
Japanese specimens in the collection appear to be in winter plumage 
(tail 2 to 2-2 inches). 
In Cevlon Capt. legge notices a difference between the birds from 
the low country and those from the hills, the latter being darker. 
He finds very little variation in the dress of the male in summer 
and winter; "but the male is always more or less uniform, while the 
female is striated at all seasons. 
Mr. Hume states that the specimens with the rufous subterminal 
mark on the inner webs of the tail-feathers are the breeding birds, 
whereas the more uniform-tailed specimens are the cold-weather 
birds. As far as I have examined European specimens, there is 
never any sign of this rufous bar, which is ehirath ristic of the specimens 
from the plains of India in full plumage; and the birds from 
"West Afiica and Nepal mentioned above (wherein ^>me of the specimens 
show a trace of the rufous bar) do not indicate any change 
of plumage in the tail by a tiinet movlt. The presence of this rufous 
bar in occabional specimens can only be accounted for h\ supposing 
that the birds change from their plain tail to tit rut mi spotted one 
without a moult, but by direct alteration of the coiouiing of the 
feather itself. 
In India according to Mr. Hume, the male is always lavp r than the 
female ; in the former the average length of wins: i% 2-1 inches, and 
in the females 1*95 inch, but he has specimens of bothfeezesw ith the 
wing 2 inches.

* It is well known that the late Sir Andrew Smith obtained se^ eral birds from 
Madagascar during his residence in South Africa, and more than one species 
has been put clown, on his authority as South-African which is now known to 
occur only in Madagascar. This seems to have been the case wi£h the present ' 
bird, as the type of D. cherina turns out to be identical with the common Grass-
Warbler of Madagascar. It is to be noticed, however, that Grill is said to have 
identified one of Vietorin's specimens as D. cherina of Smith; and it is possible 
that the Madagascar species is also found on the mainland of Africa, though I 
do not think this at all likely. 
I add a detailed description of Smith's type :-*


Adult. General colour above brown, with darker centres to the feathers, 
giving a slight appearance of streaks to the head, much more distinct on the 
back, where the centres are black; rump (damaged) apparently uniform fulvousbrov> 
n, the upper tail-coverts with narrow blackish streaks; wing-coverts dark 
brown with ashy-fulvous margins, especially distinct on the greater series; 
quills dark brown also, the primaries margined with lighter brown, the 
secondaries with ashy fulvous exactly like the wing-coverts; tail dark brown, 
with obsolete dusky bars under certain lights, the four centre feathers tipped 
with lighter brown, with an obsolete subterminal bar of blackish; all the other 
tail-feathers tipped with white, before which is a very distinct subterminal bar 
of black, the outermost feather edged with whitish; lores and an almost imperceptible 
eyebrow buffy white, the ear-coverts browner; cheeks and throat dull 
white, as also the centre of the body, the sides of which are clear brown, darker 
on the thighs; under wing-co\erts fulvous. Total length 4*1 inches, culinen 
0 55, wing 1-9, tail 17, tarsus OS. 

11 . CIBTICOLA. 265 
centre feathers tipped with a bar of whitish, before which there is a 
very broad and distinct blackish bar; crown of head a little browner 
than back, and less distinctly streaked, with paler edges to the 
feathers ; nape and hind neck rather paler than back, sandy brown 
with dark-brown centres; lores and a tolerably distinct eyebrow 
white, as also are the feathers round the eye; ear-eoverts light brown, 
mottled with darker tips to feathers, which have pale shaft-streaks ; 
cheeks whitish, washed with sandy colour; sides of hinder crown 
and sides of neck like hind neck, rather paler, with dark centres to 
feathers : throat white in centre, washed with sandy buff on sides; 
fore neck and breast light sandy buff, deepening on the sides of body, 
flanks, and thighs; abdomen whiter; under tail-coverts pale fulvous ; 
under wing-coverts and axillaries pale fulvous, deeper on lower series 
of coverts *. quills below dusky brown, light rufous on their inner 
edge. Total length 4*4 inches, cultnen 0-45, wing 1*95, tail 1*7, 
tarsus 0-8. 

The female does not differ from the male in colour. Total length 
4*2 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 1*95, tail 1*4, tarsus 0*75. 

There are two distinct phases of this species, with a uniform 
crown and a striped crown, while intermediate specimens are plentiful 
—that is to say, those which have a more or less uniform crown with 
a few indications of sandy-brown streaks. Mr. Cowan procured 
birds with plain and with streaked heads in March 1881; so that 
the difference does not depend upon the season of the year, nor is 
it apparently a sexual difference, as females of both forms were in 
Mr. Cowan's series. 

Young. A little lighter than the adult, the margins to the feathers 
of the upper surface being paler; throat and chest pale yellow; 
flanks rather clearer rufous.

Male in breeding-pflumage* General colour above black, very 
slightly varied with ashy-fulvous margins to the feathers of the 
back and scapulars; lower back and rump tawny buff, slightly 
streaked with black centres; wing-coverts blackish, edged with 
ashy fulvous, inclining to whitish on the margins of greater coverts; 
primary-coverts and quills dark brown, edged with rufous, especially 
near the base of primaries, which are ashy brown along the remainder 
of their outer margins; upper tail-coverts nearly entirely 
black, with only a very narrow margin of pale fulvous; tail-feathers 
black, margined with ashy fulvous and tipped with white, more 
especially on the inner webs, the white increasing in extent on the 
outer feathers and extending along the outer web of the external 
tail-feather; crown of head nearly uniform brown, with paler shaft-
streaks; hind neck lighter brown, forming an indistinct collar; 
lores and a tolerably distinct eyebrow, as well as sides of face, yellowish 
buff, the upper edge of ear-coverts dark brown; cheeks and 
under surface of body yellowish buff, mottled with blackish centres 
to the feathers on the sides of upper breast; sides of body and flanks 
washed with tawny, thighs a little deeper tawny; lower abdomen 
and under tail-coverts whitish; under wing-coverts and axillaries 

268 TIMELIIDJS. 

palo tawny; quills below ashy brown; inner cdgo of quills rufoscent; 
"upper mandible brown, lower mandible flesh-colour; legs 
flesh-colour ; iris brown " (Ayres). Total length 3*5 inches, oilmen 
0*45, wing 2-05, tail 1*2, tarsus 0-85. 

Tho winter plumage of the male differs from the summer dress in 
being very much more tawny and more striated ; the upper surface 
generally has the centres to the feathers blackish brown, all of them 
broadly margined with pale fulvous or tawny, with an indication of 
a lighter collar and mantle. The rump is deeper tawny, but shows 
signs of blackish striations. Underneath, the general colour is a 
very pale tawny buff, whiter on the abdomen and vent, with the 
sides of the breast distinctly striated writh dark brown ; the throat 
cheeks, lores, and eyebrow pure white; the tail-feathers are 
broadly tipped with white. Total length 4 inches, wing 2*05, tail 
1-4, tarsus 0*85. 

The female in winter does not differ appreciably from the male; 
the only female specimen in breeding-plumage seems also much to 
resemble the male in the worn character of the feathers, but still 
preserves the striated head. 

The female measures:—Total length 3*7 inches, wing 1*9, tail 1*5, 
tarsus 0*7. 

The young on leaving the nest is striated like the old female, but 
is very pale in colour, and tinged with yellow, especially on the 
lores, eyebrow, sides of face, sides of neck, and breast; the light 
margins to the tail-feathers are rather broad, the centre ones being 
reddish brown with narrow black median stripes. 

The young after its first moult (=C. ayresi) is more rufous above, 
with pronounced black centres, the mantle and back varied with a 
few greyish-white margins, the rump very decidedly rufous, with 
narrow black striations ; under surface of body tawny buff, brighter 
on the flanks and sides; the throat, centre of breast, abdomen, and 
under tail-coverts white. 

A female measures :—Total length 3*8 inches, wing 1*9, tail 1*5, 
tarsus 0*8. 
Iris, light brown; upper mandible dark hazel, under mandible 
pale; tarsi and feet pale (Ayres). 

The type of Rvmipteryx oligura, kindly lent me by Dr. Krauss, 
is the present bird in full breeding-plumage. Total length 3*75 
inches, wing 2*5, tail 1*35, tarsus 0*9. 

The type of Hemipteryx iochpyga is the present species in full 
winter plumage, and is apparently a female. Total length 3*6 
inches, wing 2*15, tarsus 0-8. Eor a sight of this typical specimen 
I am indebted to Dr. Krauss.

eyebrow and hind neck; throat, centre of breast, and abdomen 
whitish; fore neck, sides of body, and flanks tawny buff, deeper on 
thighs; under tail-coverts tawny; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
light tawny buff; quills below dusky, ashy buff on their 
inner webs. Total length 4*4 inches, culmen 0*45, wing 1*9, 
tail 2*05, tarsus 0*75. 
Mr. Gates collected a series of birds in Pegu, with the sexes carefully 
determined, from which it is perfectly evident that the full-
plumaged female is different from the male and has the head striped. 
All birds collected by Mr. Oates in the month of April are in full 
moult, from which it appears that before breeding in May they 
change at least the greater part of their plumage. In one specimen, 
otherwise red-headed, Mr. Oates found a single dusky feather; 
and from that he suggested that the winter plumage of the adult 
male was, in all probability, like that of the old female, a striped one. 
Leaving Burmah, and examining a series from Australia, we find 
the full-plumaged males with rufous heads, while the females have 
striped heads ; but one skin shot by Mr. Goodwin in March on the 
Bichmond river is moulting from the black-headed striped stage 
into the rufous-headed dress ; and there can be little doubt that the 
winter plumage of both sexes is blackish with streaked backs and 
heads. The tail is longer, as in so many winter plumages of Cistieolce. 
"Viewed from the light of these determinations, the whole difficulty 
of the question of the various species vanishes. Tn Australia 
Q. ruftceps is the adult male, C. exilis is the bird in full winter 
plumage, while O. isura is only the square-tailed, summer-plum aged 
female bird. 
At first sight Pormosan O. volitans and C. tytleri from Assam 
would appear differont from C. rufieaps by reason of their very

colour is only duo to abraded breeding-plumage; and it is certain 
that a Onpc-York bird matches them exactly. Blyth also noted

Adult female. Head and nape entirely rufous, with the exception 
of the centre of the crown, which is obscured by broad streaks of 
dull black; back black, slightly streaked with pale ashy buff, some 
of the feathers edged with this colour; the wing-coverts also black, 
broadly edged with ashy fulvous slightly inclining to rufous; quills 
brown, broadly margined with dull rufous, so that the external 
aspect of the wing is of this colour; the inner secondaries black like 
the back, and margined in the same way with fulvous; lower back 
and upper tail-coverts black, with very broad margins of sandy or 
rufous-buff; tail-feathers brown in the centre, broadly margined 
with dull rufous, all but the two centre feathers having a broad bar 
of blackish before a pale fulvescent tip, the outermost edged with 


pale fulvous externally; lores and a very distinct eyebrow pale 
rufous-buff; sides of face light fulvous, with a few whitish streaks 
on the ear-coverts, the hinder margins of which incline to rufous like 
the sides of the neck; throat and underparts generally fulvescent 
as also the cheeks, on the latter being a few indications of dusky 
tips to the feathers; the chest and sides of the body darker and 
more ashy fulvous; the sides of the breast and flanks very broadly 
streaked with black, extremely pronounced on the flanks; under 
tail-coverts uniform ashy fulvous ; thighs orange-rufous; under 
wing-coverts pale tawny buff; " bill black, the lower mandible 
reddish, but black at the extremity; legs pale flesh-colour; iris

Ohs. I have examined the type of D. dec/cms, which is preserved 
in the Bremen Museum. I cannot admit the species io "bo distinct, 
and believe it to ho only the female of D. levalllantii. I have compared 
it with a Natal bird, and it agrees exactly in dimensions, hut 
the head and flanks are more thickly streaked with black. These 
differences, however, are worthless for specific distinction, for in 
nearly all Ci&ticolte the plumages vary between a uniform and a 
striped head. In the present species, too, they seem to be of 
particularly little value, as the head is as often nearly uniform as 
streaked; and in the breeding-plumage, where the general tone of 
colour is more fulvous below, the streaks on the flanks are traced 
with some difficulty. 

A young bird, " taken from the nest" by Mr. Lucas, on the 7th of 
April, 1877, is everywhere duller than the adult, and much more 
rufous, the quills and their coverts being externally broadly rufous, 
while there is a strong shade of rufous on the rump, and the back 
is pervaded with a rufescent tinge; the head is nearly uniform 
rufous, with a few, scarcely perceptible, dusky streaks on the centre 
of the crown; the under surface of the body is yellowish white, a 
little more tawny buff on the flanks. 

The yovng after their first moult are similar in plumage to the 
adult; but can be told by the breadth of the light margins to the 
feathers of the upper surface and of the tail-feathers and by the 
general fnlveseent tone of the underparts. The breeding-plumage 
is gradually attained by the attrition of these margins, whence the 
plumage becomes much darker, the back becoming gradually black 
with sandy-buff edgings, producing a striped appearance. No rule 
seems to guide the presence or absence of the blackish stripes on the 
head, which seem to be always confined to the centre of the crown 
and nape. Both sexes have them and want theni occasionally; nor 
arc they a sign of maturity, as young birds sometimes have them 
very plainly marked, and sometimes show none at all.

General colour aboye dusky brown, with ashy margins to the 
feathers of the back; lower back and ramp more uniform ashy; 
wing-coverts like the back; median and greater coverts and bastard-
wing feathers with ashy-fulvous margins; primary-coverts dusky 
brown, narrowly edged with ashy fulvous ; quills dark brown, with 
ashy-fulvous margins to the secondaries, more rufous on the primaries 
; upper tail-coverts dark brown, margined with ashy; tail-
feathers brown, with white shafts, margins more ashy, all the 
feathers tipped with ashy whitish, before which is a broad bar of 
black; crown of head like the back: lores buffy whitish, extending 
over the eye and forming a short eyebrow; feathers round the eye, 
ear-coverts, and cheeks buffy whitish, the upper and hinder edge of 
the ear-coverts brown; throat and under surface of the body yellowish 
white; sides of body and flanks a little more ashy fulvous; 
thighs very pale tawny buff; under tail-coverts clear yellowish 
white; under wing-coverts and axillaries pale yellowish buff; quills 
below ashy brown, inner edges light tawny rufous. Total length 
5-5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2*7, tail 2-2, tarsus 1. 

This species has a very distinct iv inter plumage, which is very 
different from the dark phase described. It is sandy rufous washed 
with ashy, with very broad central streaks of black to all the feathers 
of the upper surface, including the head- That the young bird 
also commences its plumage in this tawny phase seems to be 
certain. 

The type of Drymceca strangei in the British Museum is D. fortirostris 
of Jardine, and it agrees with Eraser's short description; but 
the measurements are surely wrong as regards the wing, 4J inches, 
nearly equal to the entire length of the bird; in reality the wing 
measures 2*55 inches, so that there must be a misprint of a 4 
for a 2. 

The type of Cisticola pachyrhyncha of Heuglin having been kindly 
forwarded to me by Dr. Erauss, from the Stuttgardt Museum,
have no hesitation in uniting it with G. strangei, of which it is a 
specimen in breeding-plumage. Total length 5 inches, culmen 0*55, 
wing 2*05, tail 2, tarsus 1*05.

It is evident that G. natalensis is nothing but the winter plumage 
of C. curvirostris. The latter, as is usual with the genus Cisticola, 
is more uniform in summer than in winter; but the hen bird, even 
in breeding-plumage, would seem to be always rather more striated 
than the male. 

The young bird resembles the winter plumage, but is always 
distinguished by the yellow tint on the under surface. In May it 
begins to assume the winter dress by a direct moult. In young 
birds the bill is more or less yellowish, and this character is preserved 
in the winter plumage of the adult. In the breeding-season 
the bill becomes more or less black.

country.

Adult. Greneral colour above ashy grey, broadly streaked with 
black centres to the feathers; rump uniform ashy grey; wing-coverts 
ashy grey with blackish centres, the median and greater coverts 
slightly washed with rufous on their outer webs; bastard-wing 
feathers dusky, externally ashy fulvous, the outermost whitish 
along the outer web ; primary-coverts dusky, with a narrow edging 
of ashy rufous; quills dusky, externally rufous, forming a conspicuous 
wing-patch; inner secondaries black, externally edged with 
ashy whitish along the inner web; upper tail-coverts ashy grey, 
slightly fulvescent on the margins and with faint dusky centres; 
tail-feathers ashy brown, slightly greyer on the edges and tipped 
with ashy brown, before which is a broad subterminalband of black ; 

11 . CISTICOLA. 281 
outer feathers tipped with white ; crown of the head a little more 
ashy fulvous than the back, slightly rufeseent on the forehead; lores 
and feathers round the eye yellowish white, extending above the 
eye ; in front of the eye a dusky spot; ear-coverts and cheeks yellowish 
white, the former browner on their upper and hinder margins ; 
throat and under surface of the body pale yellowish, the abdomen 
a little whiter; sides of the body and Hanks washed with ashy; 
sides of the upper breast dark ashy grey ; thighs light tawny ; under 
tail-eoverts very pale tawny buff* under wing-coverts very pale 
tawny buff; axillaries whiter; quills light brown below, inner edges 
rufeseent. Total length 5*4 inches, culmen 0*0, wing 2*35, tail 2*1, 
tarsus 0*95. 

The specimen above described is an adult bird in full plumage 
from the Gold Coast. 

Young. Much more yellow underneath than the adult and more 
sandy coloured above, as the rump is sandy brown and the feathers 
of the back are edged with sandy buff instead of ashy grey; the 
hind neck, too, is sandy ; the head is streaked like the back, the centres 
of the feathers being blackish brown, the edges sandy buff; underneath, 
the yellow tinge is very strong. 

The head even in fully adult birds is often slightly mottled with 
dusky; but beyond the fact that the young bird is decidedly streaked 
on the crown, I have not been able to establish that the uniform 
head is a sign of old age alone, as specimens undoubtedly adult are 
found both with perfectly uniform as well as with slightly mottled 
heads; the latter may, however, be in winter plumage. The colour 
of the crown also varies from ashy brown to pale fulvous or even 
rufous-brown; and even 0. amyhilecta of Reich enow, the type of 
which has been kindly lent to me by Dr. Peters, seems to me to be 
only a more than usually rufous example of 0. ncevia. The sides 
of face, rump, and especially the lower tail-coverts are very rufous, 
but the latter are approached in tint by some of the specimens in 
the British Museum. 

The specimen of 0. Jugubris lent to me by Dr. Krauss, from the 
Btuttgardt Museum, is undoubtedly the same as the West-African 

G. ncevia. It is either a young or winter- plum aged specimen. 
The East-African bird seems to me to be inseparable from the 
true Q. ncevia. The type of Gistkola isocfactyla, Peters, kindly lent 
me by the original describer, is very similar to West-African specimens, 
but has the crown of head nearly uniform rufous, forming a 
distinct cap. This is not always strongly defined in West-African 
birds, which often have the nape of the same colour as the hind 
neck. Total length 4*6 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2*05, tail 1*9, 
tarsus 0*9. 

A female (Mombasa; Dr. Fischer) measures :—Total length 4*5 
inches, culmen 0*55, wing 1*95, tail 1 65, tarsus 0*85. 
In South Africa the colours are somewhat paler; but the species 
usually known as O. fulvifrons cannot be specifically separated from 

C. lugubris. It is perfectly identical with G. isodactyh of Peters.

blackish shade, the centre feathers light brown with rufescent margins 
; crown of head and nape uniform rufous, the hind neck very 
pale fulvous, lighter than the back; lores and eyelid yellowish white; 
ear-coverts dusky pale rufous, with pale shaft-lines; cheeks and 
under surface yellowish buff, whiter on the chin and centre of the 
abdomen; thighs more tawny ; under tail-coverts yellowish buff; 
on the lower Hanks the feathers long and silky, and of a pale fulvous

Obs. The type of Drymceca leucopygia of Heuglxn is a damaged 
specimen of C. rujiceps in the Yienna Museum. The rump having 
been shot away, the long silky white feathers of the lower flanks 
have been pulled over on each side, so that the bird looks as if it 
had a white rump, which is not really the case.

margined all round with ashy grey; tail rufous-brown, margined 
with fulvous, tipped with dull white or rufous, before which is a 
distinct bar of black on all except the two centre feathers ; lores 
and a narrow eyebrow dull white; round the eye a tiny ring of 
buff feathers; sides of face dull white, browner on the ear-coverts; 
entire under surface of body dirty white, the sides of the body and 
under tail-coverts ashy brown, the breast with a few small spots of 
brown; thighs tawny burl"; under wing-coverts huffy white, the 
lower surface of the wing broadly edged with rufous along the inner 
Veb. Total length 5 inches, culmen u-5, wing 2*05, tail 2-2, 

tarsus 0*7. 

The bird above described is a male in breeding-plumage ( = C. 
subrvficajjitta of Smith). The head in the breeding-dress appears to 
have always some blaeki&h streaks on the crown. 

At present I have not s-een an example, the female sex of which 
has been ascertained by direction in the breeding-season. 

The 1/ointff bird is browner than the adult, without the grey 
mantle, and'is always very distinctly and broadly streaked with 
dark brown; the under sumee k yellowish, with triangular spots 
of dusky on the breu>t. inclining to linear streaks on the flanks. 
After Us first movlt the male bird lobe> the spots on the breast, and 
is mure of a jello-wi^h-buff colour underneath, and has a more distinct 
rufous forehead ; ilu j* tuaU afbr th first moult, however, 
appears* not to lo^e the MietikN on the breast so soon as the male, 
and is much more thickly and distinctly streaked with black above. 

The adults iii full venter jthnfiotp { = 0. 'mdattula, Sharpe, nee 

Peters) are more reddish brown above, with the siieaksless strongly 

pronounced; the head U neaily uniform rufous, the eyebrow ful


vescent, and the unclerpaits strongly washed with fulvous. 

Adult femah in n inter jtlinuatft. General colour above fulvous


brown, almost tawny, i\ ith. indistinct mesial streaks of darker brown 

on the back and scapular*; the upper tail-coverts and rump uniform;

286 TIMELIIILE. 

The above description is taken from a female killed in Damaralaud 
by Mr. Andersson on the 12th April, 1865. Two other dissected 
females also obtained by him agree in dimensions. A male shot at 
Elephant Vley on 5th of August, 1859, has the wing 2*1 and the 
tail 1*95. Young birds of both sexes after their first moult are the 

Q. leas of Finsch and Hartlaub. 
As in the ease of many Cisticolce the tail-feathers are longer in 
winter than in summer—a male in the C.-lais plumage having the 
tail 2-45, while a female has it 2-3. 

Young iii winter plumage (type of C. lais). Above fulvous-brown, 
very broadly streaked with black, the margins to the dorsal feathers 
rather rufescent; head and hinder neck more rufous than the back, 
the blackish stripes much less distinct and indeed almost obsolete on 
the nape and hinder neck ; rump uniform fulvous- brown ; the upper 
tail-coverts also with very faint mesial streaks of blackish; wing-coverts 
ashy fulvous with dark-brown centre», the greater series more shaded 
with rufous externally; quills dark brown, broadly edged with 
rufous externally so as to give a rufous aspect to the wings; the 
margins of the secondaries paler and more fulvesscent; tail rufescent 
brown, lighter rufous on the margins, the two centre feathers with


out any subterminal black mark and irregularly waved across with 
dusky bars under certain lights ; all the other feathers with a broad 
black subterminal bar, the tips being fulvesceiit this pale ending 
being more distinct on the outer plumes and forming: a margin to 
the last rectrix; lores and feathers round the eye yellowish buff 
forming a tolerably distinct eyebrow; sides of face ash)- fulvous, the 
ear-coverts rather browner with obsolete dusky tips* to the feathers cheeks 
fulvous; chin and centre of the body white; the throat and 
sides of the body tawny fulvous, clearer on the thiglis, the flanks 
slightly shaded with brown • under wing- and tail-eoverts tawnv 
buif; bill brown, yellowish at the base of the under mandible; W s 

yellowish. Total length 5 inches, culmen U-45, wing 2*1, tail 2S5 
tarsus 0*75. (Mus. Brcm.) 


In the above stage of plumage the head is frequently of the same 
colour as the back, though the latter often gives an indication of the 
approaching grey back characteristic of the fully adult bird. Below 
the young birds id ivinttr pin magi are of a deeper cchraceous buff 
than at any other time of their life. 

C. chiniana is nothing more than a large race of C. stthnijicapilla, 
with a general tendency to a more uniform rufous crown. 
Adult male of larger race in hrt^ling-plvMinrp:. Head and nape 
uniform rufous ; back ashy brown, with dark-brown centres to the 
feathers, the scapulars more grey; wing-coverts coloured like the 
back, with pale fulvous margins to the feathers; quills dark brown, 
externally margined with rufous, becoming paler towards the tips of 
the feathers, especially of the primaries, the innermost secondaries 
edged all round with ashy fulvous ; tail light brown, slightly rufescent, 
the two centre feathers darker brown with fulvous margins 
and tipped with pale fulvous, the outer ones with white, all having 
a blackish subterminal bar; lores yellowish buff, as also a ring of 

11 . CISMCOLA. 287 
feathers round the eye; feathers over the eye fulveseent, but not 
forming a very distinct eyebrow; ear-coverts greyish brown, with 
narrow whitish shaft-lines; cheeks, throat, and undcrparts white, 
the flanks somewhat washed with fulvous-grey, the sides of the 
upper breast greyish brown; thighs tawny butt"; under wing-coverts 
also pale tawny buff; lower surface of quills brown, the edge of the 
inner web pale rufous; bill brown, the lower mandible lighter; feet-
very light brow7n ; iris light hazel. Total length 5*0 inches, culmen 
0-55, wing 2-6, tail 2*7, tarsus 0*9. 

The description is taken from a specimen collected by Mr. T. E. 
Buckley in Bamangwato on the 10th of June, 1873. 

The winter plumage is, as usual the case with these Warblers, 
much more mealy in appearance, the feathers not being abraded, 
but having broad fulvescent margins to the feathers- the head is 
always lighter, but the colour of the back varies from greyish to 
fulvous-brown, the mesial black streaks, however, being always 
distinct. In winter the breast and sides of the body are light tawny 
buff, leaving the throat and centre of the belly more conspicuously 
white. 

A series of male specimens obtained by Mr. Andersson give the 

following measurements:—Total length 4-8-5-3 inches, culmen 0-55


0-6, wing 2-4-2-65, tail 2-5-2-75, tarsus 0-9-0-95. 

Females measure:—Total length 4-7-5-2 inches, culmen 0-5-0*55, 

wing 2-1-2*15, tail 2-25-2-45, tarsus 0-85. 

The only character by which G. chiniana could ever be separated 

from O. suhrtificcqnlla is by the larger bill, which measures 0-35 

from the anterior depression of the nostril to the tip of the bill, 

while G. subruficapiUa has it 0*25. Intermediate specimens, how


ever, are found which render it impossible to do more than consider 

0. cliiniana a race of the Capo bird. 
In Ireedlng-pluwtage the feathers become so abraded that the 
ashy colour almost disappears from the mantle, the brown central 
streaks are nearly obsolete, and the head becomes rufescent brown, 
so that there is very little difference in the colour of head and back. 
In this plumage it is G. procera of Peters, the type of which I herewith 
describe:— 

Adult (type of G. procera). General colour above light brown, 
a little washed with ashy on the back, with indistinct centres of 
slightly darker brown; the wing decidedly more ashy; wing-coverts 
light brown, margined with ashy, slightly tinged with rufous on the 
greater series • bastard-wing feathers brown, edged with dull whitish; 
primary-coverts and quills brown, edged externally with very pale 
rufous, lighter towards the end of the quills, and ashy on the outer 
web of the inner secondaries ; upper tail-coverts light brown, edged 
with ashy fulvous; tail-feathers light brown, barred across with 
dusky under certain lights, all tipped with ashy fulvous, and having 
a distinct subtcrminal bar of blackish brown, the tips to the outer 
feathers whiter; crown of the head and nape dull rufous-brown, a little 
clearer on the forehead ; lores and feathers round the eye yellowish 
white; ear-coverts pale reddish, with whitish shaft-lines; cheeks 

288 
TIUELIIDJE. 

and under surface of the body dull yellowish white; sides of the 
body and flanks slightly tinged with fulvescent; thighs pale tawny; 
under tail-coverts yellowish white; under wing-coverts very pale 
fulvous; axillaries'whiter; quills below ashy brown ; inner edge of 
quills pale rufous. Total length 4*4 inches, culnien 0*55, wing 2*6, 
tail 2-2, tarsus 0-9. 

Of Cistlcola cantans I have examined two of the typical specimens 
in the Museums of Stuttgardt and Vienna; it is the large form, 
and identical with G. cliiniana of South Africa. 

In Damara Land a peculiarly rufous form occurs (C. ritfilata, 
Hartl.). I have seen one other specimen besides the type, of which 
I give a full description. 

Adult male of rufous race. Above sandy brown, the dorsal feathers 
mesially dark brown, giving a slightly streaked appearance, these 
streaks shaded with rufous on each side, imparting a rufous appearance 
to the back; head and neck uniform light chestnut; wing-
coverts light brown, washed and tipped with ashy fulvous, the median 
series with obsolete indications of a rufescent streak near the tip; 
quills brown, externally edged with pale rufous, especially near the 
base of the primaries, the margins to the inner secondaries paler; 
rump uniform sandy brown ; upper tail-coverts pale rufous, with 
lighter buff margins ; tail light chestnut, all the feathers tipped with 
huffy white, before which is a blackish-brown subterminal bar, the 
two centre feathers much more narrowly tipped, and the subterminal 
bar very indistinct; lores and a very well-marked eyebrow dull 
white; sides of face yellowish, the upper margin of the ear-coverts 
inclining to chestnut; cheeks and throat dull white ; rest of under 
surface of the body yellowish ochre, darker on the sides and much 
lighter down the centre ; thighs pale chestnut; under wing- and 

tail-coverts yellowish ochre; inner lining of quills ashy brown, margined 
with rufous along the inner web; bill dark brown, the under 
mandible yellowish; feet yellowish. Total length 5*7 inches, cuimen 
0-55, wing 2-3, tail 2-7, tarsus 0*95. (Mm. Brem.)

Mr. Gould's specimen seems scarcely adult, as the black of the 
face is not strongly pronounced, and one in the Cockerell collection 
has dusky spots on the throat, which Mr. Gould says are wanting 
in the species. A specimen in the Cockerell collection agrees with 
Mr. Gould's type and differs from the bird described in having the 
sides of the face and ear-coverts greyish, and in having the underpays 
generally paler.

Group V. CEAMMM. 

The curious little bird which forms the single representative of 
the present group possesses characters which seem to ally it to 
several other groups; and it is not surprising that it has been considered 
by Prof. Baird to belong to a separate family Chamceadce. 
The wing is essentially Timeliine, being concave and rounded, with 
a large first primary; the legs, too, are strong; but in other respects 
the general aspect of the bird is Tit-like, and Prof. Baird 
places it in close proximity to the Tits in his 4 Eeview.'

The Pork-tails have many habits in common with the Wagtails 
(Motacillidce), which they also resemble in their sryle of coloration. 
In the form of wing, however, they are essentially Timeliine, and 
are placed in this family as an aberrant group. It is somewhat 
curious that three genera so strikingly different in characters should 
not have received names before, but, as far as I can find out, they 
have all been hitherto included in one genus, Henicurus.

The rufous back, which I considered to be sufficient for the 
separation of the present species from E. rufiea^illa. is not really a 
specific character, as the hen of if. rvji -apilla has the back rufous. 
In no stage of plumage, hovt ever, has the last-named bird been 
described with a white throat; and as the bird from the Lawas 
river described by me appeared to be perfectly alult, I have 
thought it better to keep the two distinct for the present.

Group YI. ORATEROPODES. 

In this group are placed the true Babbling-Thrushes, remarkable 
for their strong clumsy feet and claws and powerful rounded wings. 
As a rule they are gregarious in their habits, and are poor songsters ; 
but there is much in their form which is suggestive of the true 
Thrushes. All the genera here enumerated seem to me to be closely 
allied inter se, though it is not easy to place them in linear order; 
but the true Qrateropochs extend in an unbroken series of genera 
through GarrulcLV and its allies to SufJwm and Ptimrloxorais* which 
cannot be far removed from the Paskhe. Eupetes is an aberrant 
Timeliine form, with affinities towards Cinch's and Henicunts* and 
Drymoeclus seems to be allied to the true TLtielice. The genera 
most out of place in the present group appear to me to be Megalurulus, 
Ciwlorhamphns, and C'alammithvs, the two latter being 
quite aberrant, whilst MttjaTunihts seems to be a Grass-Warbler in 
its habits. Farther research will perhaps lead to the disposition of 
these genera in other groups of birds ; but, after considering all 
points of their structure, it seems to me that their natural affinities 
are rather with the Cmi?ropi than with any of the other groups 
admitted into the present volume. 

Key to the Genera*. 

a. Bill equal in height and breadth at nostrils, 
or at leavt not higher than it is broad, 
a'. Shafts of tail-feathers produced and stiffened 
1. OBTHOXYX, p. 329. 
b'. Shafts of tail-feathers ordinary. 
a". Tail longer than wiii2*. 
a"1. Wing rounded, the distance between 

the first and second primaries less 

than the tarsus. 

ak Tail less graduated, the distance 

between the outer and the middle 

tail-feathers much less than the 

tarsus. 

a5. Wing slightly more pointed; first 
primary long, and equal to the 
long secondaries; tarsus short, 
not more than one fourth of 
length of tail................ 2. CIXCLOSOITA, p. 331. 

* Amongst the Crateropode* k&$ hitherto hem placed the geuu» Tkanumcataphus 
of Tiekell. This genus was established by this author in 1840 from a 
single specimen said to have been procured near Darjiling, and named by him 
Thamnooataphus picaius. This specimen has remained unique in the Indian 
Museum at Calcutta, and has been considered to be an Indian bird by all subsequent 
writers, who have placed it in the vicinity of-Gampmrhynchust a true 
CEATEEOPODES. 


325" 

b5. Wing very much, rounded ,* first 
primary short, much less titan 
the long secondaries; tarsus 
very long, and equal to one 
third of length of tail. 


a3. Bill very long, equal to head, 
the cuimen exceeding length 
of hind toe and claw; no 
rictal bristles 3. EUPETES, p. 338. 

65. Bill not so long as head, the 
cuimen not exceeding the 
hind toe and claw; rictal 
bristles present, though small. 
a7. Legs not very stout, the 
hind toe and claw less 
than half the length of the 
tarsus. 

as. Quills very much graduated, 
the 3rd much 
shorter than the 4th, 
which is again shorter 
than the 5th, which is 

one of the longest 4, PYCNOPTTLTTS, p. 342.

Quills le&s graduated, the 
3rd nearly equal to the

Crateropodine form. Thus Jerdon, writing in 1863, observes, concerning 
Tkamnocataphus:— 

"This remarkable form differs from all the other members of this family 
(except Sibia and Gamjpsorhynchits) by its white wing-spot, assimilating it still 
nearer to the Shrikes; and indeed it is very similar in its mode of coloration to 
some of the African Shrikes. The general character of its plumage, however, 
combined with its elevated and strong tarsi and feet, its habitat in a region rich 
in varied forms of this family, and its near affinity to Gampsorhynckus, have 
influenced me in placing it here." 

Since the above date the species has been duly catalogued in the lists of 
Indian birds, including the latest and most complete one by Mr. Hume, published 
in 1879. 

On reading Jerdon's description, however, I came to the conclusion that the 
species must be an African Dryosoopus; and an application made to Dr. Anderson, 
the Director of the Indian Museum, for a loan of the specimen, was readily 
acceded to. When the skin arrived in England it needed but a glance to see 
that Thamnocataphus picatus was nothing but the common Bush-Shrike of 
South Africa, Dryoscopv.s rufiventris (Swains.). The following synonymy 
belongs to the specimen, and must, be added to that of D. rufiventris;— 

Thamnocataphus picatus, Ticlcell, J. A 8, Beny. xviii. p. 812 (1849); 
Blyth, Cat B. Mus. As. Soe. p. 150 (1849); JercL B. bid. ii. p. 13 (1863); 
Hume, Sir. F. 1879, p. 95. 

Garrulax picatus, Gray, Eand4. B. I p. 282, no. 4175 (1869). 

How the mistake arose is impossible to say, but it is probable that the skin of 
the African Bush-Shrike was received by Colonel Tickell in exchange from 

M. Verreaux or some other collector, and that it got mixed up with his 
Darjiling collection, and was described by him as a new species and the type of 
a new genus.

* Temminck founded the genus Orthonyx in 1820, but did not name any 
species. In 1826 Vigors and Horsfield and Stephens gave names to the 
typical species; but neither of these were recognized by Temminck in 1827, 
•when he called it O. spinicaudus. Although there can be little doubt that both 
the names temmmcltii and maculatus were published before that of spinicaudus, 
yet the impossibility of stating which of these two names was published first, 
and the general acceptance of Teinininck's name by all ornithologists, determine 
mo to retain it.

are separated from the white abdomen by a line of black feathers as in 
the other Ginclosomata; and this appears not to be the case in G. 
casianotliorax. The bad condition of the skin, however, renders it 
difficult to say for certain, though Mr. Gould had no doubt on the

A young bird appears to be dusky blackish below, through which 
the ochraceous-brown plumage is appearing. It further differs from 
the adult in having the throat white, the head reddish brown, with 
scarcely any indication of the brighter forehead beyond a dull greyish 
shade above the lores. The general tone of the plumage also is 
much duller, especially as regards the brilliant golden-brown edges 
to the quills and tail-feathers.

Adult female (Dorei Hum; Beccari). Differs from the male in 
having the entire upper surface chestnut, without any bine; the 
chestnut-colour, however, is much duller than in the male, except 
on the lower back and rump; wings as in the male; cheeks and 
throat white; remainder of under surface blue, as in the male. Total

Obs. The Marquis Doria having very kindly lent me the types of 
Count Salvadons Eiipetts cewtanouotus, I found, on comparing the 
types of my E. pitlcTmr, that the two species are not separable. The 
preparation of Mr. Goldie's skins quite hides the black collar which 
encircles the white throat; and thus I overlooked this character. 

It seems from the two specimens obtained and sexed by Beccari, 
that the female only differs from the male in having the rump and 
upper tail-coverts chestnut instead of blue, and in being duller in 
colour. The bird described by me as the adult female of E. pidcJier 
turns out not to have been fully adult. It has the crown of the head 
dusky brown, the tail dull blue, with the two centre feathers brown, 
the lores and plumes at the base of the nostril black, surmounted 
by a narrow line of uifous, washed with blue above the eye, and 
inclining to whitish above the ear-coverts. The dusky brown head 
and the particoloured eyebrow arc both signs of immaturity, as the 
adult female shot by Beccari has the eyebrow of as bright a blue 
as the male. The specimen alluded to also has the under tail-
coverts spotted with white ; and this I rind to be an unfailing mark 
of nonage. 

In another young bird in the Museum the head is dusky bluish, 
and the abdominal feathers are fringed with ashy fulvous.

The type of Trochalopterum simile of Hume is in the British 
Museum, and differs in having the outer aspect of the wings and 
tail ashy grey instead of golden olive. At first sight this seems to 
he a good specific distinction; but on examining a series it is found 
that both golden-winged and grey-winged birds are found inhabiting 
the same locality, and on some of the golden-winged birds a 
shade of grey is apparent, as if the golden passed into the latter colour. 
Mr. Hume (Str. P. 1878, vol. ii. p. 457), however, maintains the 
specific distinctness of the two forms, and says that *; at their head 
quarters each is perfectly true to type without any admixture of 
the other ; and these their head-quarters are widely separated."

Adult. General colour above olive-brown, mottled "with blackish 
margins to the feathers, before which is a subtenninal bar of lighter 
olive, these margins more narrow and less conspicuous on the lower 
back, rump, and upper tail-coverts; sides of neck like the back, but 
more decidedly mottled with a pale siibtenniiial bar ; crown of head 
dark ashy, with black edges to the feathers, the forehead tinged with 
fulvous; wing-coverts olive-brown, lighter on the bastard-wing 
feathers; primary-coverts blackish, externally olive-brown; quills 
dusky, externally golden-olive, the primaries ashy grey towards 
their ends; the secondaries externally olive-greenish, the innermost 
tipped with ashy; tail-feathers blackish, washed with golden olive 
on the outer webs, the centre feathers shaded with olive for nearly 
their entire length, the outer ones narrowly tipped with white;

and olive-brown margins ; the throat dark ashy, shaded with olive; 
fore neck and chest more olive-brown, with a subterminal bar of 
pale ocbraceous before a dusky-brown edging to the feathers; flanks, 
thighs, and under tail-coverts dull olive-brown, as also the axillaries 
and under wing-coverts; the lower series of the latter dusky like the 
quills below, these latter being more ashy along the margin of the 
inner web; 4; bill dusky; legs reddish brown ; iris reddish brown ,J 
{Jerdon). Total length 8 inches, culmen0*8, wing 8'65, tail 3-85, 
tarsus 1*45. 

Oba. The plumage in this species appears to be subject to considerable 
bleaching, especially as regards the golden colour of the 
wing, which fades to a whity brown. 

Young birds always have the outer aspect of the wing thus faded 
in tint, and are more rufous-brown as well as more uniform on the 
upper surface, some of the feathers with blackish edges, but the 
subterminal light markings of the old bird not perceptible; the 
under surface of the body is also uniform dull brown, darker on the 
throat, but without the least appearance of the ochraceous mottling 
which is such a conspicuous feature of the adult.

which are not seen on the rump and upper tail~coverts; upper wing-
coverts like the back; quills brown, externally like the back; tail-

Obs. Mr. Hume (cf. Str. F. vii. p. 459) hesitates to believe that 
Hodgson's Timalia pdlotis and T. leucotis are identical; but I have 
little doubt that T. jjelhtis is the young of T. leucotis or T. ni$alensis. 
The type of the latter does not seem to be in the Museum : 
and I must remark with regard to Mr. Hodgson's drawings, that 
they are not so accurate as is usually the case; for the ear-coverts 
in the young birds are not so entirely uniform brown as he represents, 
nor is the old bird's face so entirely white. From an examination 
of the skins in the British Museum it is evident that the 
younger birds are much more rufous underneath than the old ones, 
and this rufous colour gradually disappears. This may happen 
irregularly, as Hodgson's plate of T. leucotis represents that bird 
with a bright rufous breast, whereas in the adult white-eared skins 
in the museum this colour has almost disappeared. The white ear-
coverts always retain a few brown feathers, as far as our specimens 
prove; and in the young birds, instead of being uniform, they are 
mixed with white.

Adult. Similar to G. rufulus, but more fulvous in general appearance, 
and having an orange shade round the neck forming an indistinct 
collar ; but the most striking difference is in the white tips 
and edgings to the tail-feathers, instead of the golden-buff colouring 
of these parts in 67. rufulus; the underparts are also much brighter 
golden buff in colour, and there seems to be some slight mottling of 
black spots on the sides of the fore neck; " bill greyish horny or 
fleshy white, with, in some cases, a dusky line on the culmen; the 
legs and feet greyish white, slaty white, or fleshy white, with a

There is no perceptible difference in the colour of the sexes, 
beyond the fact that the ft male appears rather duller and has the 
crown shaded with olive; she is also slightly smaller. 

Young birds also have the head shaded with olive and the wings 
externally more reddish brown ; the sides of the breast and flanks 
are dull brick-red, with which colour also the breast is washed. 

Obs. Having examined a large series of the true P. scliisticeps In 
the collection of the British Museum and that of Captain TTardlaw 
Bamsay, I And it extremely difficult to separate P. miehdis and 

P. olivaceus as has been done by the last-named gentleman in his synopsis 
of the genus (7. c). I agree with him in uniting P. leiieoyaster 
of Gould to P. scliisticeps; and though Goulds name has been employed 
for the Burmese bird, his specimen originally came from 
Darjiling, and there is every reason to believe that it was the 
ordinary species of that locality, of the description of which in the 
previous year by Mr. Hodgson Gould was Ignorant at the time he 
wrote. As with most of the Pomatorhhd^ the present species differs 
in size and to a certain extent in colour, many of the specimens 
being more rufescent olive and having the head shaded with olive 
also. The amount of white striping on the sides of the breast is 
also more pronounced in some than in others, nor is an indication of 
a rufescent collar always absent. Thus I consider that P. nuehalis, 
Tweedd., is nothing more than a race of P. scMstkeps, and P. olivaceus 
is also not deserving of specific rank. I therefore separate 
them as subspecies merely, adding the bird from the Xorth-western 
Himalayas as another rufous-collared race.

more or less blackish from the forehead to a short distance in front 
o£ the nostril; legs and feet plumbeous or greenish plumbeous; feet 
generally more bluish than tarsi; claws dusky, pale horn at base " 
(TK V. Legge). Total length 8 inches, culmen 1-1, wing 3*5, 
tail 3*6, tarsus 1*2. 

Young. A bird in nest plumage, shot at 2sTuwara Elliya, is very 
ferruginous above, and likewise on the sides of the chest and flanks; 
the head and ear-coverts are not so black as in the adult; and the 
white of the chest is very much contracted, and does not exteud so 
far down on the breast. The bill is much straighter than in the 
adult. 

The sexes are alike in plumage, according to Captain Legge, who 
states, however, that the bill varies in length and curvature according 
to age. Captain Wardlaw Eamsay, in his paper on the present 
genus, published in the ' IbisJJ for 1878, calls attention to the difference 
in colour which is shown by specimens of the present species ; 
and on looking over his series, as well as that in the collection of 
the British Museum, it would seem that two races, one olivaceous 
in tint and the other rusty-coloured, can be distinguished; but 
Captain Legge enters fully into this subject in his book on the 
Birds of Ceylon, and finds " that a gradation from the plumage of 
the most ferruginous birds, which come from the damp districts of 
the south, where moist climate and heat are combined, to that of 
hill birds from the upper zone is very perfect, a complete sequence 
being obtainable on going up " through the wilderness of the Peak 
from the low-lying portion of Saffragam to the Horfcon plains.1' His 
remarks on this subject are well worthy of perusal.

Obs. The types of P. Jwrsfieldii of Sykes appear to me to belong 
to the pale race (P. obscurus, Hume), in which case the dark Travancore 
birds would require a new name. The typical specimens, 
however, are so faded from long exposure to the light that I do 
not like to refer ihem positively to the pale form. 

Obs. Although Mr. Hume has separated this species as distinct 
from P. horsfieldii, I cannot see that it is any thing more than a 
race; and occasionally specimens come so close to the typical P. Jiors


fieldii that it is difficult to find any ground for separating them. 
The Travancore specimens of the latter vary almost as much in the 
direction of a dark race as P. obscurus does towards a light one. 

Hob. Replaces the foregoing species in South-western India, 
ranging from the neighbourhood of Xhandala as far northwards as 
Mount Aboo.

Considerable difference is shown in the plumage of this bird in a 
series of specimens. Some are more ashy on the head and back 
than others ; and certain individuals have the latter rufous-brown, 
while the head is also washed with rufous-brown. Again, the black 
streaks vary very much in breadth on the breast, and are much 
browner in some individuals than in others.

21 . POlfATOKBEXNTTS. 42 9 
the rufous line behind the ear-coverts, no mention of which is made 
by Br. Jerdon either in Ms description (' Ibis/ 1872, p. 801). The 
rufous line is mentioned by Blyth in his original description of P. 
liyjpoleucus, and is present in all specimens examined by me from 
Aracan, Cachar, and the Ehasia hills; but in one bird from the 
Graro hills it is absent, and this is the P. hypoleiicus of Jerdon (nee 
Blyth)*. The Cachar specimen in the Museum has the rufous line; 
but this is feebly developed in several others, and I doubt whether 
the two species will be ultimately found to be distinct.

Young, More rufous than the adult, especially on the head, sca

except on the throat and centre of breast and abdomen, which are 

whiter. 

The specimen described is from Darjiling; and on comparison with 

examples from the N.TT. Himalayas it appears at first sight to 

be different on account of the greyish shade on the throat, this 

being white in the latter. Although some of the birds from the 

north-west occasionally show an ashy shade on their throat, there 

can be no doubt that their general character is rather lighter than 

those from the eastern Himalayas; but Nepalese specimens show 

great variation in the amount of ashy shading on the throat; and so 

it becomes impossible to separate them even into two races. 

Hal. Entire range of the Himalayas, throughout the hills of 

Eastern Bengal; reaching to Tenasserim.

Adult. General colour above ashy olivaceous brown, the crown of 
head and mantle of the same colour, the lower back and rump more 
fulvescent brown ; wing-coverts like the back, the bastard wing 
and primary-coverts dusky blackish washed with ashy grey; quills 
dark brown, externally fulvous-brown, edged with olive-brown, the 
primaries externally hoary grey; upper tail-coverts and tail-feathers 
olivaceous brown, all but the two centre feathers with a distinct 
white tip, before which is an extensive shade of black; head like 
the mantle, but separated from it by a broad band of orange-rufous ; 
lores and a distinct eyebrow ashy white, edged below with a broad 
line of black feathers from above the eye to the sides of the nape; 
feathers below the eye silvery whitish, varied with black shaft-
streaks ; a line of black running below the ear-coverts; moustache 
and throat white, separated from the rest of the under surface by a 
broad black collar running across the fore neck from the sides of 
the neck; remainder of under surface creamy white, washed with 
fulvous on the under tail-coverts; sides of body orange-buff, the 
thighs more ashy,- axillaries orange-buff like the sides of the 
breast; under wing-coverts dusky brown; quills brown, ashy fulvous 
along the inner web ; " upper mandible dark horn-colour, lower 
one bluish horn at the base and tip and darker horn in the middle; 
mouth bluish; iris orange-brown; eyelids and orbital skin dusky 
blue; edges of the eyelids orange-yellow; legs light plumbeous; 
claws pale horn" (Oates). Total length 10*5 inches, culmen 1*4, 
wing 5*6, tail 5*2, tarsus 1*85. 

The ear-coverts in this species are often quite black; and between 
these and the silvery white ear-coverts there seems to be every gradation. 
My impression is that the ear-coverts get blacker with age, 

442 TIMELIIDJB. 

as young birds have entirely white car-coverts. In Eurmah the 
specimens aro very much paler than the Himalayan examples, and 
have! he tips of the tail-feathers more or loss fawn-buff in tint; 
the colour of the orange-rufous flanks is also reduced to a pale fawn-
buff. These characters, however, seem to vary in intensity ; and I 
think it best therefore not to consider them of specific value, but 
as indicating a pale Burmese race.

Adult General colour above fulvous olive-brown, the wing-coverts 
like the back, the bastard wing and primary-coverts somewhat 
washed with ashy; quills dark brown, externally olive-brown, the 
innermost secondaries entirely of the latter colour, the primaries 
ashy on the outer webs; four centre tail-feathers olive-brown washed 
with fulvous-brown near the base, the others olive-brown with a

broad subterminal band of black before the white tip, which is very 
well marked and increases in extent towards the outer feathers; 
crown of head like the back, but separated from it by a broad collar 
of orange-rufous ; a broad white eyebrow extending from the base of 
the nostrils to the sides of the occiput, and separated from the crown 
by a dusky line ; lores, feathers round the eye, and ear-coverts ashy 
black, with a white patch on the fore part of the latter ; cheeks and 
throat white, with a circular collar running from the hinder cheeks 
down across the fore neck, and the throat round this collar becomes 
gradually orange-rufous ; remainder of under surface white, tinged 
with fulvous on the under tail-coverts ; the sides of the body light 
tawny, washed with brown on the inner flanks; thighs ashy brown; 
axillaries light fulvous-brown; under wing-coverts ashy brown, the 
lower series light tawny; under wing-eoverts dusky brown, light 
fulvous along the edge of the inner web ; " iris bright yellow* eyelids 
dull purple ; bill dark horn, the tip and margins pale horn; 
legs light plumbeous; claws pale horn-colour; the iris is sometimes 
greenish yellow, which probably indicates immaturity" (Gates). 
Total length 11 inches, culmen 1*15, wing 4*55, tail 5, tarsus 

1*65. 

As a rule the ear-coverts in the series I have examined have not 
varied much, having been mostly blackish with a large patch of 
white; the latter, however, often becomes quite obscured. The 
wing ranges from 4*4 to 4*8 inches. 

In Burmese specimens the tips to the tail-feathers are constantly 
buff; but in examples from the eastern Himalayas they are white * 
so that this colouring of the tail-feathers cannot be considered a 

specific character. A pair shot by Mr. Oates measure :—

Adult. General colour above rufous-brown, the wing-coverts like 
the back, the ones near the carpal bend of the wing edged with 
ashy grey; quills dark brown, externally rufous-brown, the primaries 
paler, the innermost secondaries almost entirely rufous-
brown ; tail-feathers dark brown, washed with rufous-brown near 
the base ; head and nape grey, as also the lores, sides of face, and 
ear-coverts ; cheeks, throat, and under surface of body light rufous-
buff, paler on the abdomen, the cheeks and chin slightly washed 
with grey; sides of body darker rufous-brown, also the thighs; 
under tail-coverts light rufous-brown, with fulvous bases to the

feathers ; under wing-coverts and axillaries light rufous-huff; quills 
dusky brown below, fulvescent along the edge of the inner web ; 
" hill black, the inside of the mouth greenish yellow; legs and feet 
plumbeous brown, the claws dusky horny, posterior part of tarsus 
bluish; eyelid plumbeous; iris white" (W. V. Legge). Total 
length 10 'inches, culmen 1*05, wing 4-2, tail 4, tarsus 1-5. 

Young. Lis dull grey, with a dark outer circle; bill black, the 
gape and base of lower mandible yellowish ; eyelid greenish yellow; 
legs and feet olivaceous brown, soles yellowish fleshy, claws yellowish 
brown ; forehead and head as in the adult, the nasal plumes 
dark, and the grey of the crown not continued so far back; the 
back is deeper rufous than in the adult, and the wing-coverts likewise 
are more intense; chin not so white, and the throat and under 
surface more fulvescent. In the first plumage the feathers of the 
chest and breast are fluffy. This dress appears to be quickly put 
off; and in the next or yearling plumage the iris is pearly grey, or in 
some white with a tinge of recldish; gape and eyelid yellow; legs 
and feet bluish brown. There is scarcely any perceptible difference 
in the grey of the occiput; but the fore neck is paler and more 
fulvescent. (W. V. Legge.) 

Hah. Peculiar to the island of Ceylon, where it occurs up to an 
elevation of 3500 feet in humid and inaccessible jungles. It seems 
only to be found in the central province, as, according to Legge, it 
is not known from the jungles of the south-eastern, eastern, or 
northern divisions of the island.

"Sexes alike. All the specimens from Nepal are darker than 
examples from the Himalayas further to the west • the streaks on 
the body-feathers above pure white, or slightly sullied white, not 
yellowish " (Scully). Specimens from the Dafla hills are decidedly 
darker than Himalayan examples. The rufous-brown colour is 
more intense, and the black band on the sides of the head more 
pronounced, while the ear-coverts are rufous-brown streaked with 
white, without any admixture of black as in typical G. striata. 
The light shaft-streaks on the crown are almost obsolete in the 
Dafla bird. (3£us. H. H. Godwin-Austen,) 

Young. Plumage more fluffy than in the adult, reproducing all 
the colours of the old bird, but everywhere paler and not so rufous; 
the light central streaks to the feathers not so strongly pronounced, 
either on the upper or under surface of the body.

Like G. umdatvs, but more olivaceous and les* lufescent above, 
and with the car-coverts, feathers behind the eye, and posterior 
portions of cheeks silvery white, more or less tipped with black, and 
with the three exterior tail-feathers on either side broadly tipped 
white. (Hium, I c.) 

This markedly distinct but yet closely allied species replaces 

G. ewndatus of Nepal, Sikhim, &e. on parts of the Efaiibia hills, 
near Shillong. (Hiuac, 1. c.) 
On the difference of the colour of the upper parfc>, marked as it 
is, I lay no stress, because Sikhim and Nepal birds of this class are 
always deeper-coloured and more rufeseent than specimens of the 
same species from the Khasias. But 1 have examined over thirty 
specimens of G. umdatus; and not one exhibits a trace of the broad 
and conspicuous white tippings to the three external lateral fail-
feathers characteristic of the present species, nor does one of them 
show a trace of the large pure white patch on either side of the 
head that distinguishes G. suhearidatus, (Ilihne, 1. c.) 

The following dimensions are taken from the skin:—Length 10 
to 11 inches, wing 4*2-1*0, tail 5-5*8, tarsub 1-48-1*6, bill at 
front from frontal bone 11*1)0-1 *< *3. (Ifinne, I. e.) 

Obs. Colonel Godwin-Austen's specimens from the Naga hills are 
true G. ccemlatus.

Range. The whole of Africa below the Sahara Desert; Indian

I see no rea&on why the Indian species of Malacocercus should be 
kept apart from the African Craterojji. It is true that the latter, as 
a rule, have the wing and tail equal in dimensions, and in the Malacocerci 
the tail is a trifle longer than the wing: but this is not invariably 
the case, and the difference is too small to be of generic 
importance in this instance, llore marked is the excess in the length 
of wing over that of the tail in the two African species 0. atripennis 
and Q. Iiayaesii, which are also aberrant in their style of colouring, and 
further resemble the Indian Jlalacocerci in their yellow bill; but I 
can perceive no advantage in separating them from Orateropus, which 
they otherwise resemble in form.

Hab. Xorth-ea^tern Africa from Eordofan to the Gazelle river 
and probably down the whole of Eastern Africa to the Zambesi. I 
think that Capt. Speke's specimens from 17/inza must haye belonged 
to this species, and not to C. jardinii. C. cine mis is now considered^ 
Heuglin to be a small race with a pearl-coloured eye. 
A specimen in the Bable lluseum, obtained by Pais at A^aapim* 
has been kindly lent by Prof. Pditirneyer. I believe it to^be the 
true C. jjlebtins of Ruppell; it is very much darker than the type 
of C.h'rl'ii, the only specimen T haye to compare with it. Whether 
the bird in the Basle 3Iuseum has become bleached, and looks paler 
on that account, I cannot say; but if it is of the normal colour of 
O.plebeius, then C. lirlcii will certainly be a recognizable dark race.

tail-coverts somew hat more ashy brown; lesser and median wing-
coverts like the back; greater series and quills rather darker brown, 
margined with pale brown; tail-feathers brown, with obscure dusky 
cross bars under certain lights, the feathers edged with reddish 
brown near the base; head pure white, as also the ear-coverts, 
cheeks, and chin, the hinder cheeks light brown like the sides of the 
neck; under surface of the body, from the middle of the throat 
downwards, light brown, inclining to pale ochraceous on the breast, 
abdomen, thighs, and under tail-coverts; the throat and fore neck 
rather washed with ashy, and having pale Mvescent margins and 
lighter shaft-lines down the feathers ; the brown of the throat 
rather darker where it adjoins the white ; under wiog-coverts and 
axillaries pale fawn-buff, those along the edge of the wing light 
brown; quills brown below, pale reddish along the edge of the 
inner web; u bill horny black ; legs dusky lead-colour; iris orange-

Total length 9*6 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 4-3, tail 4*3, tarsus 1*35. 

Adult female. Does not differ from the male in plumage. Total 
length 8*5 inches, culmen 1, wing 4*2, tail 4, tarsus 1*25. The specimen 
is moulting • and the new feathers seem to be very much darker 
brown, the plumage doubtless fading from exposure after a time. 
As is usual with these white-headed Babbling Thrushes, the young 
birds have brown heads, and remains of the immature brown 
plumage are often seen in white-headed individuals. 

Hah. "Widely distributed in North-eastern Africa, being resident 
in Nubia from about 17° X. lat. to the Lower White Nile, and 
occurring throughout Eogos Land, Abyssinia, and Sennaar, but not 
higher than 5000 feet. The specimen enumerated below from 
Benegambia is the first instance of this bird's capture in West 
Africa; and though by no means an improbable bird to find there, 
its occurrence will require confirmation.

Adult female. Exactly Eke the male. Total length 9*3 inches, 
culmen 1*05, wing 4*5, tail 4*5, tarsus 1*4. 

Many specimens have their white plumage interspersed with 
brown feathers. These are the remains of the young plumage, 
which is quite different from the adult. 

Young. Light brown, with darker brown wings and tail; forehead 
with dark shaft-stripes; sides of face ashy brown, as also the 
ear-coverts; throat and breast greyish brown, with a few dark 
bhaft-streaks to the feathers of the throat; remainder of under 
surface pale fulvous-brown, lighter in the centre of the abdomen. 

Ohs. The change from the brown plurnage of the young to the 
white livery of the adult bird appears to me to fake place somewhat 
irregularly. Some specimens seem to get their white head 
and back before they have lost their brown under surface; while 
others, like the type of 0. lujpoleiws in the Berlin Museum, get 
the white throat and breast while the back is still dark brown. It 
may be that two or three seasons elapse before this species completes 
its perfect white-and-hrown dres**, which would account for 
the number of half-and-half-coloured individuals which are seen 
in collections.

General colour above dark umber-brown, with obscure paler edges 
to the feathers; the hinder neck and sides of the latter mottled with 
dark ashy centres and paler edges to the feathers; wing-coverts 
like the back; quills dark brown; rump pure white; upper tail-
coverts brown, tipped and edged with ashy grey, the outer ones 
washed with the latter colour; tail-feathers dark brown with dusky 
cross bars under certain lights ; lores, forehead, and a broad eyebrow 
white, the frontal plumes pointed and slightly washed with hoary 
grey, which increases on the crown, the hinder part of the latter 
being ashy grey or brown in the centre of the feathers, which 
are margined with hoary grey ; cheeks and throat pure white; the 
under surface from the centre of the latter brown, the feathers 
margined with hoary grey, before which is a subterminal shade of 
darker brown ; flanks slightly tinged with pale ochreous brown ; 
lower abdomen, vent, thighs, and under tail-covcrts pure white; 
under wing-coverts and axillaries fawn-coloured, those near the 
edge of the wing mottled with brown centres, as are also some of 
the greater series; quills brown below, tawny along the margin of 
the inner web ; " bill black; feet dusky greyish; iris crimson " 
(Heuylhi); " feet olivaceous ; iris orange-yellow, almost scarlet" 

(W. T. Blanf ord). Total length 10*5 inches, culmen 1, wing 4-75, 
tail 4*75, tarsus 1*4. 
The bird described, though in fine plumage, is probably not quite 
ad alt, as the head becomes pure white washed with hoary grey in 
the very old bird. A male with white head from Adigrat {Blan


ford) measures—total length 10*5 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 4*65, 
tail 4*7, tarsus 1-45. 

Young. Differs from the adult in being more fluffy in plumage, 
which is more reddish brown, having also the feathers edged with. 
light rufous; the rump dull \\ hite; the head dull ashy brown, with 
only the lores, sides of face, ear-coverts, and chin dimly indicated by 
dull white; under surface pale brown, more or less washed with 
ashy, and inclining to whitish on the vent and under tail-coverts. 

In the full-grown young bird (C. limbatus, Riipp.) the general 
plumage is darker brown, and more like that of the adult, excepting 
that the head is dusky brown, leaving only the lores, eyebrows, 
cheeks, ear-coverts, and throat white, the frontal feathers washed 
with hoary grey; the centre of the throat and hinder surface 
brown with narrow lighter edges to the feathers, the thighs also

Adult. General colour above brown, slightly rufescent, the feathers 
with whitish shaft-lines; head more ashy than the back ; rump and 
upper tail-coverts ashy brown, the latter decidedly paler; wing-
coverts ashy brown; quills dark brown, externally ashy brown, 
broader on the secondaries; tail-feathers dark brown, with dusky 
cross bars under certain lights; the centre tail-feathers more ashy 
brown, the outer tail-feathers distinctly paler brown at the tips; 
lores dull white, surrounded by a narrow dusky line; sides of face 
ashy brown, the cheeks and throat clearer ashy, the bases dusky, 
producing a somewhat mottled appearance; under surface of body 
pale ashy fulvous, the breast and sides of the body ashy brown, all 
the feathers with white streaks; under wing-coverts and axillaries 
pale fulvous ; quills dark brown below, ashy fulvous along the margin 
of the inner web; " bill horny brown; legs dingy or fleshy 
yellow ; iris pale yellow " (Jerdon). Total length 9 inches, oilmen 
0*9, wing 3*9, tail 4*2, tarsus 1*35. 

Hah. The greater part of the Indian peninsula from the Himalayas 
southward, and extending into Scinde. In Central and Southern 
India a darker race occurs, which has been generally separated as a 
distinct species on account of its smaller size and darker coloration, 
the mesial light streaks on the mantle being generally wider and 
plainer. There appears to me to be such a gradual transition between 
the two birds that I do not believe any definite specific 
characters can be found to separate them. It should be noticed, 
however, that Jerdon gives the bill in the southern race as being 
entirely dark yellow.

Another specimen, apparently fully adult, differs from the type in 

being much brighter and more chestnut-brown, this colour beino 

carried up the entire throat, and leaving only the base of the chin 

and the sides of the throat hoary grey. This may p>robably be the 

adult female, though such a difference in the colour of the sexes is 

unusual in the genus. Some other birds, however, in the collection 

have the throat grey washed with chestnut, as if they were younq 

males gaining the fully adult grey-throated plumage.

Adult. General colour above brown, the feathers slightly mottled 
with fulvous-brown margins; head distinctly more hoary than the 
back; wing-coverts like the back, and edged in the same manner, 
those near the margin of the wing hoary whitish; quills light brown, 
edged with fulvous-brown and with whitish at the tips; upper 
tail-coverts ashy brown, with darker centres to the feathers; tail-
feathers brown, with dusky cross bars under certain lights, margined 
with whity brown, the outermost whitish along the outer web, 
on the centre feathers a slight shade of ashy; lores, feathers above 
the eye, and eyelid hoary; below the eye a black spot; ear-coverts 
fulvescent, the hinder portion brown with hoary centres to the 
feathers; cheeks and throat blackish brown, with a few whitybrown 
feathers intermixed; remainder of under surface dusky 
brown, with whity-brown margins to a few of the feathers; the fore 
neck and chest more broadly edged with whity brown, and consequently 
lighter in appearance; thighs and under tail-coverts whity 
brown, the latter with dark brown centres to the feathers; under 
wing-coverts and axillaries dusky brown, the edge of the wing whity 
brown; quills pale brown below, creamy white along the inner 
web; " bill, inside of mouth and tongue black ; feet flesh-brown; 
iris hazel" (Gould). Total length 9*2 inches, culmen 0*9, wing 4*25, 

tail 4, tarsus 1-45. 

Ob$. The specimens with the sooty-black under surface have the 
bill black, and appear to be in breeding-plumage. In winter dress 
the under surface is overspread with ashy, which gradually disappears. 


Young birds are much more mottled above and of yellowish buff 
colour, being pale fulvous below, with the throat white and a tinge of 
deeper sandy buff on the chest; in the centre of the abdomen a 
blackish patch. 

The female, according to Gould, is less than half the size of the 
male, is similar in colour; but the feathers being more broadly margined 
with brownish white impart to her a paler hue than her mate; 
the under surface is also much lighter, and the patch in the centre 
of the abdomen is much smaller. 

As the size of the abdominal patch seems to me to vary in proportion 
to the amount of remains of winter plumage, I cannot believe 
that C. eantiUam is really distinct.

whitish from the base of the bill to above the ear-coverts, the latter 
being brown; eyelid dull whity brown; cheeks and under surface 
of body dull ashy whitish, more fulvescent on the thighs and under 
tail-coverts ; lower throat and fore neck browner, forming a band

wing-coverts fulvous or whity brown, those near the edge of the 
wing mottled with blackish bases; quills pale brown below, ashy 
fulvous along the inner web; " bill dark lead-colour in summer, 
fleshy brown in winter; tarsi yellowish grey; feet bluish ashy

The specimen described has a black bill, whereas some of the 
others examined by me have yellow bills, as well as more numerous 
and distinct streaks or spots of brown on the fore neck and chest. 
In the black-billed specimen the plumage is more or less worn*and 
the chest uniform, and it is evident that the dark bill is a sign of 
breeding-plumage. The pale-billed birds have also a more fulvous 
appearance, which indicates the winter dress. 

There is considerable difference in the size of the specimens, the

In the present group I place all the species which I consider to be 
the most typical Timeliine birds. They are closely connected with 
some of the other groups recorded in the present volume ; but many 
of them are very Museieapine in appearance, and resemble the Ply-
catchers so closely that it is almost impossible to draw a definite 
line between some of the broader-billed Timeliulce and some of the 
narrower-billed Mwcicapicfa. The genus Tata-re having been omitted 
by the author of the fifth volume, is included here ; but it is manifestly 
out of place in the Timeludcp, and in a future rearrangement 
of the genera should be classified with AcrocepJialm.

Adult General colour above fulvous-brown, the wing-coverts 
like the back ; quills light brown, externally fulvous-brown; tail-
feathers light brown, with dusky cross bars under certain lights, 
and washed with ashy fulvous; crown of head bright chestnut, 
relieved by a creamy-white band across the forehead, extending over 
the eye, and separated from the chestnut crown by a narrow line of 
black; lores and feathers between the nostrils and the eye black; 
cheeks, sides of face, and ear-coverts white, the latter fringed on the 
extreme hinder margin with grey; sides of neck ashy grey, extending 
upwards onto the sides of the nape; throat and breast white, 
the sides of the latter ashy grey, all but the chin lined with mesial 
shaft-streaks of black; centre of the belly ochreous buff, the sides 
of the body fulvous-brown, as also the thighs and under tail-
coverts ; axillaries light fulvous-brown, the under wing-coverts pale 
tawny buff; quills light brown below, ashy fulvous along the edge 
of the inner web; " bill black ; eyelids dark bluish grey; inside of 
mouth black; legs purplish brown, claws horn-coloured; iris dark 


red" (E. Gates). Total length 5-8 inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2*o, 
tail 2-SD, tarsus 0*95. 

The male is larger than the female according to Mr. Hume, the 
wing in the latter being as small as 2S inches, while the male 
reaches to 2*6 inches in length. 

05s. I fail to see any specific difference between the Javan birds 
and those from India or Burmah; and I think that the larger bill 
mentioned by the late Lord Tweeddale as a character for the Javan 
Timelia is only the sign of the male bird, as suggested by Mr. A. O. 
Hume. Whether it extends "down the Malayan peninsula seems 
doubtful; but the specimen in the British Museum from Malacca 
bears Capti. PinwilTs label, with his own handwriting on it. Mr. 
Jerdon has also stated that its range extended down the Malayan 
peninsula, but he does not give his authority.

Adult (type of species). General colour above deep rufous-brown, 
the head a little more dusky, and the lower back and rump slightly 
clearer than the rest of the upper surface; wing-coverts like the 
back; quills dusky brown, the primaries externally light rufous, 
the secondaries darker rufous, the innermost entirely rufous-brown; 
tail-feathers dull rufous-brown ; lores and a very narrow eyebrow, 
as well as the ear-coverts, pale tawny buff; lores, feathers round the 
eye, fore part of cheeks, and feathers below the eye and throat 
white; remainder of body bufTy whitish; the flanks, thighs, and 
under tail-coverts tawny buff, the sides of the body richer in colour; 
under wing-eoverts pale tawny; quills dusky brown below, light 
rufous along the inner web; "bill black; legs pale corneous 
or dull grey-brown; iris nearly white" (Godwin-Austen). Total 
length 8 inches, culmen 0*85, wing 2*8, tail 4*4, tarsus 1*1. 

The Oude specimen is not quite so rufous on the upper surface 
as the example from Nepal; but below it is of a much richer tawny 
buff on the sides of the body. This may be due partly to the

Adult. General colour above rufescent brown, more ruddy on the 
head and neck; wing-coverts tawny brown; quills light brown, 
externally rufous, the inner secondaries entirely of the latter colour; 
tail-feathers brown edged with rufous; lores and a small line above 
the ear-coverts white; round the eye a narrow ring of white 
feathers; ear- coverts brown like the head, excepting the fore part 
of them, which is white like the cheeks and feathers below the eye; 
throat and chest pure white; remainder of under surface of body 
creamy white, as well as the flanks, thighs, and under tail-coverts; 
under wing-coverts fulvous, the axillaries whitish, the outer coverts 
light reddish; quills pale brown, light rufous along the inner web; 
"bill black, with the nostrils deep yellow; legs orpiment-yellow; 
irices dark brown, with an outer circle of buff; orbits bright 
orange " (Jerdon). Total length 6*5 inches, culmen 0*6, wing 2'b, 
tail 3*5, tarsus 1. 

The female does not differ in colonr from the male. 

Young (Coonoor; E. G. Wardlaw Eamsay). Coloured like the 
adult, but more fluffy in plumage; a slight shade of olivaceous above, 
and the head and wings somewhat less rufous than in the old birds; 
underneath somewhat whiter; "bill dark brown; legs yellowish 
brown; iris pale brown " (B. G. W. B.). 

Captain Legge was uncertain whether the bird from Southern 
India was the same as the black-nosed race from Ceylon or the 
yellow-nosed race of continental India, A series in Captain Wardlaw 
Eamsay's collection shows that the South-Indian bird is identical 
with true P. sinensis from other localities, and P. nasalis must be 
held to be peculiar to Ceylon. 

Birds of the year will probably be found to be paler and more 
fulvescent in tone of plumage than adults. 

Specimens from Nepal seem to be darker than those from 
Southern India, which are not only paler in general plumage, but 
have also the head nearly uniform in colour with the back. Independently 
of the fact that we know nothing of the changes of 
plumage (if any) of the present species, and therefore cannot say if 
these slight differences are due to age only, it appears that examples 
from Behar and Calcutta are intermediate; and therefore the question 
of there being two species cannot be entertained. 

Hab. The whole of the Indian peninsula from Sindh eastwards, 
not ascending the hills, extending into the Burmese countries as far 
as Moulmein in M". Tenasserim, and ranging into Siam.

Adult. Very similar to P. sinensis* but distinguished at once by 
its black nostrils. Smaller differences are also seen in the less 
amount of rufous on the wing in Ceylonese birds. *' Loral skin, 
perceptible through the feathers, greenish yellow; bill and nostril 
black ; legs and feet dull yellow, extremities of toes dusky; claws

The adult female resembles the male in colour. Some examples, 
probably immature birds, are more deeply tinged on the lower parts 
than others, and some have a brownish spot immediately below the 
gape. (F. Legge.) 

Hob. Peculiar to Ceylon, where it is generally distributed, being, 
however, somewhat local, and commoner in the southern parts.

The present species is evidently liable to get its plumage much 
worn : it was one in such a condition that Dr. Jerdon originally 
obtained; and this may account for his description of the type not 
quite agreeing with Mr. Hume's specimens, whence the latter gentleman 
redescribed the species as P. griseigularis. Jerdon's type is 
in the British Museum, to which he presented it in 1862, along with 
the types of other species described in the ' Ibis' for that year. 

Mr. Blanford's bird, procured in Scinde, was kindly lent to me by 
that gentleman. It is so closely allied to P. altirostris that I should 
not like to separate it specifically without seeing a larger series; but 
the Scinde bird appears to me to have the ashy white colour confined 
to the throat, whereas in Burmese specimens this colour pervades the 
throat and breast. 

Hal. Burmah and Pegu, ranging through the low country of Assam 
to the Bhootan Booars, probably ranging westwards into Scinde.

paler fulvous; axillaries sienna-buff, with white bases; under wing-
coverts bright sienna-butf; quills light brown below, fulvescent

dusky, claws brownish" (W. V. Legge). Total length 5-9 inches, 
culmen 0*6, wing 2*15, tail 2-45, tarsus 0;S. 

Captain Legge says that " the rufous of the lower surface seems 
to be brighter in the breeding-season, with the white of the throat 
and breast more sharply defined against it." In the young bird, 
according to the same naturalist, the forehead wants the ferruginous 
tint and is eoneolorous with the head, while the iris is pale olive-
greyish. 

Rah. All over the low country of Ceylon in all parts of the island; 
and on the peninsula of India ranging from Travancore along the 
west coast as high as Candeish, occurring again on Mount Aboo.

Captain Legge says that the female is smaller than the male, and 
has the iris buff. The measurements of the species are given by 
him as follows:—Length 6*4-6*75inches, wing 2*35-2*65, tail 2*52*
7, tarsus 1-1*1, middle toe and claw 0-8-0*85, bill to gape 0*730*
87. 

Young. Yery similar to the adults on the upper surface, but differing 
in its olive-green colour underneath, the throat being rather 
more yellowish, but without any of the fawn-coloured shade of the 
adults. In the young male, according to Captain Lcgge, the iris is 
pale reddish buff, and in the young female it is white. He does 
not know whether the female bird at any age has a red eye like the 
male, thougn he procured one specimen of a female which had a 
faint reddish inner circle to the iris.

coverts like the back, with the same paler shaft-lines ; quills dusky 
brown, externally olive-brown, the innermost secondaries rather 
more reddish brown; tail-feathers uniform ashy brown, slightly 
washed with olive-brown on the edges; head and nape dull rufous, 
with fulvescent shaft-streaks, more distinct on the forehead; lores 
and a broad superciliary streak extending to the sides of the nape 
oehraceous buff, as also the feathers round the eye; superciliary 
feathers tipped with black ju>t above the eye; a dusky spot in front

Some specimens appear rather more rufous than others, and have 
the rufous crown very strongly defined. In a Madras specimen 
the general cast of the plumage is ashy and the crown is only 
slightly more rufescent than the back, the superciliary streak is 
whitish, and the under surface also very pale, with light-brown 
streaks on the breast.

Canon Tristram has recently shown that the genus Tatare ought 
to be placed with the Warblers and not with the Timeliine birds as 
it is here located; and he goes so far as to refer all the species of 
Tatare to the genus AcrocepJialus; but on comparing the species of 
Tatare with Aerote/)Jirtlus turdoides, the type of the latter genus, 
although I rind that they closely resemble each other, yet I think 
they are not generically identical. Acrocephalus, for instance, 
besides having a much shorter bill, possesses a very much more 
pointed wing, the distance between the primaries and the secondaries 
being much more than the length of the hind toe and claw; whereas 
in Tatare the wing is much more obtuse, and the distance between the 
primaries and the secondaries is less than the length of the hind toe 
and claw. 
Mr. Seebohm having admitted that he was wrong in leaving out 
the members of the genus Tatare from the fifth volume of the present 
work, I include it here near Bernieria, the most Acrocephaline of 
the Timeliidas, in order that the species may be recorded in the

Ohs. Canon Tristram has kindly lent me the type of this species 
to describe. I think that the grey colour of the bird is probably due 
to fading of the plumage, the specimen having apparently been in 
spirits. All the species of Tatare appear to be liable to fade, as far 
as my experience goes of specimens in Museums.

This genus is unknown io me; but it is stated by Cassin to 
be nearly allied to B^rttieria. As it is unlikely that a species from 
Gaboon will be generictUy the same vs one u'oni Ma "aga^ear, I have 
kept Macrospliuius distinct from B^rnUrw, and have reproduced 
Cassin s original descriptions. 

General aspect of Odlwtomns (0. tc/>cus. Tenini. u ind Eha,nphoccenus

Bill long, rather strong, straight, wide at base, compressed towards 
the end; upper mandible carinated. curved and distinctly notched 
at the tip; nostril in a lar^e membrane; under mandible rather 
thick, somewhat curved in its outline, ascending towards its tip. 
Wing moderate; first quill purions ; fourth, fifth, and sixth longest

Of**. There is* a considerable variation in the colour of the eareovert* 
in the present species, as, for instance, in the male from the 
Kakhyen hills, where they are entirely bright orange. I was at 
iir-t inclined to separate this bird as a distinct species; but I find 
an approach to these brightly coloured ear-coverts in some of the 
Xepales.e series, and I notice that the brighter ears are accompanied 
by a more pronounced black chin-spot and by a richer colour on the 
brea&t. It is probable, therefore, that the brighter coloration indicates 
the adult male.

species inhabits Java. Count Salyadori (lice. Born. p. 213) very properly 
doubts its correctness: the specimen is apparently a native Malaccan skin.

it with the West-African species of 'Jardlrosfris or Trichotfouia. I have 
never seen the species, and therefore cannot judge from personal observation ; 
but the fact of the wing and tail being given as equal in length would remove 
it from the true members of the genus Ti'fdiaus,

Advlt tiialt. General colour above olivaceous brown, with faintly 
indicated pale shalt-streaks on the feathers of the head and mantle; 
the rump uniform : upper tail-coverts more ferruginous or tawny ; 
tail-feathers brown, with du>ky cross bars under certain lights, the 
feather * margined with fulvous-brown; wing-coverts olivaceous 
brown like the back; greater series and quills sepia-brown, esternallyfulvescent

coverts fulvous with wiiitibh shaft-lines; cheeks and throat dull

and chest fulvescent brown, becoming* deeper on the sides of the 
body and inclining to ochreous buff on the flanks and thighs; the vent 
and under tail-coverts deep rufous ochre; under wing-coverts and 
axillaries light fulvescent brown; quills ashy brown below, fulvescent 
along the edge of the inner web; " upper mandible dark

brown ; eyelids plumbeous " (K W. Oaies). Total length 5-6 inches, 

culmen 0*85, wing 2*95, tail 2, tarsus 1. 

On comparing a series of this species, it will be seen that the 
Malayan and Bornoan specimens are rather paler than those from 
Burmah and Assam, and do not acquire the rich colour of the 
under tail-coverts which the last-named birds exhibit. The shade 
of colour, however, is too slight to found a specific difference upon. 
In some individuals the dusky tint on the throat and breast takes 
the form of ashy streaks. 

Bab. Prom North-eastern Bengal and the Eastern Himalayas, 
through Burmah and Tenasserim, down the Malayan peninsula to 
Borneo.

brown, more fuivescent on the back and duller on the head, the 

upper surface mottled with distinct pale centres and yellowish 

shaft-Hues to the feathers, which are also distinctly edged with 

black; lesser and median wing-coverts like the back, the greater 

coverts rather duller brown, with yellowish shaft-lines; primary-

coverts and quills externally rufous-brown, dusky brown on the 

inner webs; rump a little lighter than the back and not so di


stinctly black-edged; upper tail-coverts and tail dull chestnut-

brown ; lores white, obscured by blackish tips to the feathers ; 

eyelid black; car-coverts rufous, narrowly streaked with black; 

cheeks white, mottled with blackish edgings to th<» feathers : throat 

white, the lower part slightly mottled with a few triangular spots or 

edgings of ashy blackish; remainder of under surface of body light 

fulvous-brown with white ,-haft-lines ; the thighs and flanks uniform 

fulvous-brown ; centre of the breast and abdomen pale ashy, mottled 

with white centres to the feathers and dusky markings and bars; 

under wing-coverts and axiilaries light fuivescent brown; lower 

series of under wing-coverts ashy-brown: quills dull brown below, 

ashy fulvous along the edge of the inner web. Total length 

6*7 inches, culmen 0*85, wing 3-2, tail 2-5, tarsus 1*2. 

In the specimen described the ear-coverts are rufous: and the 
bird may therefore only be the female. Xone of the specimens in 
the British Museum have the sex marked. Host of them, however, 
have black ear-coverts and are very much darker in plumage, with 
more distinct black spots and edgings on the feathers of the throat 
and fore neck. Behind the ear-coverts, too, is a patch of fuivescent 
feathers, each of which is edged with brown. 

In one bird the ear-coverts are rufous, changing into blacjs;; and 
this specimen appears to show that the young male has -rufous ear-
coverts like the old female, and then changes into the black coverts 
of the adult.

Adult male (East Java; "Wallace). General colour above earthy 
brown, with scarcely pronounced light shaft-streaks on the mantle; 
wing-coverts like the back, the greater sexies with clearer fulvescent 
margins; quills blackish brown, externally fulvescent brown, the 
innermost secondaries uniform and slightly more olivaceous brown; 
upper tail-coverts rather more reddish brown than the back ,* tail-
feathers brown, more fulvescent on their edges, and paler at the 
tips of the outer ones ; crown of head black, narrowing in a point 
down the nape ; a distinct eyebrow of tawny buff or orange; lores 
dull white, with black-tipped plumes in front of the eye; ear-
coverts brown, with narrow whitish shaft-lines; eyelid and a line 
of feathers above the ear-coverts ashy grey, extending in a less 
marked manner to the sides of the nape; sides of neck brown like

of the body orange-rufous or tawny, the under tail-coverts and flanks 
washed with brown; throat white; thighs orange-rufous; under 
wing-coverts a little lighter than the breast, and of a rather more 
ochraceous brown colour ; quills light brown, pale fulvous along the 
edge of the inner web ; bill horn-black, browner towards the tip; 
edges of upper mandible and lower mandible pale ; legs, feet, and 
clavis brown. Total length $•& inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2*7, tail 
2-4, tarsus 1-25. 

I have not met with an example of an undoubted adult female; 
but specimens probably of this sex are in Capt "Wardlaw Ramsay's 
collection, as they have the ear-coverts orange-rufous instead of 
brown. 

Young. Differs from the adult in being everywhere more rufous, 
especially on the wings and tail; the underparts are of a deep orange-
rufous, and the white throat is scarcely perceptible; the eyebrow, 
which is very distinct, and the ear-coverts and sides of the face are 

554 TDIDSUXDM, 

of the same colour as the underparts; the crown is blackish brown 
instead of jet-black, and forms a cap, instead of extending down 
the nape as in the adult. The bill and feet are also paler.

Tweecldale as to the identification of Birth's species, and to dissent from the 

view afterwards taken by Mr. Hume. The original specimen was discovered 

by the late Colonel Tickell at Amherst in Tenasserim, and was forwarded bj 

him to Blyth at Calcutta. Colonel Tickell's paper describing the species arrived 

by a later mail than his specimens ; and in the meantime Bh th bad given names 

to them. This circumstance is explained by Colonel Tickell in the l Ibis' for 

1863, pp. 111-113. 

The further history of the species appears to be as follows :—In 1873 Mr. 

Hume, when describing a supposed new Pellomenm, from Thayetmyo as 

P. minus, reproduced in a footnote the original description of P. tickellL In 
1874 the same gentleman described a new Trichastoma as T. minor from Tenasserim 
; and in the succeeding year the late Lord Tweeddale described a Bnrmocataphus 
fidvus from Iiarennee. In the ' Birds of Burma' Biyth identified his 
Pellomeum tickelli as a true Pelfonieitm, and placed as a synonym P, subochraceum 
of Swinhoe. This was evidently a mistake, and Mr. Biyth's memory must 
have failed him when uniting these two species. P. 'minus of Hume is also 
admitted by Blyth into his ' Birds of Burma ;' and Lord Tweeddale, in editing 
the latter book, followed Blyth in stating that it was a synonym of P. tickelli. 
In the same work Lord Tweeddale suggests that Trichastoma minor of Hume 
is probably the same as T. abbo*fi; but this is also an error on Lord T^eeddale's 
part. In the first' List of the Birds of TTpper Pegu,' a bird is identified 
by Mr. Oates and Mr. Hume as Pellomenm tickedi. Mr. Oates brought a specimen 
of the same bird home to England, which is now in the British"Museum, 
and is duly recorded below; so that in this year the species may be said to have 
been rightly identified by Mr. Oates, and his conclusions ratified by Mr. Hume 
as editor of 'Stray Feathers/ In 1S7G Mr. Oates published a note on Pellorneum 
minor of Hume and P. tickelli of Blyth, in which he animadverts on Lord 
Tweeddale's identification of these two species ; but the matter is fully explained 
by the latter ornithologist in a letter to the * Ibis' fur 1877 (p. 3<35); and at 
p. 451 he contributes a " 'Note on the Pellomeum tickelli of Blyth," in which he 
shows that Pellomeum minus of Hume is P. svbochraeeum of JSwinhoe. and that 
Drymocatcvphtts fulvus of Walden is the same as Pellomenm tickelli of Blyth, 
but points out that it is a true Drymocataphus, and should sfuid as I), tickelli 
(Blyth). A figure is given which cannot be said to be very characteristic, as 
the delicate shaft-stripes on the upper surface and the faint dusky markings on 
the throat and breast are omitted. Mr. Hume had published independently in 
the same year (' Stray Feathers,' 1877, p. 59) his opinion that Brymocataphus 
fulvus of Walden and his own THckastoma minor were one and the same species.

To the ' Ibis' Mr. Hume sent a farther note on these species, in 1878, accom


panied by specimens of the bird which he identified as Pellomeum tichelli, and 
also examples of his Trichastoma minor, asking if the Editors would find out if 
the latter was identical with Tar dimes garoensis of Goclwin-Austen. The Editors 
of the ' Ibis' submitted the specimens to Colonel God win-Austen, who identified 
Pellomeum tichelli (Blyth apud Hume) as the same as his Turdimis garoensis, 
" male." from the Dana hills. Trichastoma minor of Hume ho shows to be the 
same as D. fulvus, Walden, and also identifies it with the true Pellomeum 
tichelli of Blyth: he further considers it to be distinct from his Turdinus garoensis, 
though closely allied to it. In the same year (Sir. F. 1878, p. 259) Mr. 
Hume allows the identity of D. fulvus with his Trichastoma minor, and suggests 
that T. garoensis, GS-odwin-Austen, is really the same species. In this conclu.
sion he is quite right, as I am abloto affirm from an examination of the type of 

T. garoensis, which Colonel Godwin-Austen has kindly lent to mo. Further 
on, in his account of the ' Birds of Tenasserim,' Mr. Humo writes of Pellomemn 
tichelli, and does not agree with Colonel Godwin-Austen's identifications, and 
reiterates his previous opinions. Mr. Oates's collection, however, contains a 
poor specimen from Dhollab, in Assam, which was given to him by Mr. Hume, 
and which I believe to be the bird which the latter gentleman considers to 
be true P. tichelli of Blyth. This specimen, which is now in the British 
Museum, is really the same as the male of Turdinus garoensis from the Dikrang 
valley in Colonel G-odwin-Austen's collection; but it is not the same species as his 
Turdinus garoensis, according to my views, after an examination of both the 
specimens referred to ; and it is this mistake which has puzzled Mr. Hume. The 
latter gentleman, at p. 514 of vol. vi. of ' Stray Feathers,' says that he has obtained 
a specimen of the true Turdinus garoensis of G-od win-Austen; but I do 
not feel certain, from reading his remarks, that he has really obtained GodwinAusten's 
species. In 1879 Mr. Hume, in his ' List of the Birds of India,' still 
adheres to his belief that Pellomeum tichelli is distinct from his Trichastoma 
minus, and refers them to two different genera; but I trust that, after reading 
my remarks, he will be able to agree with my conclusions. Mr. Oates, who 
examined the subject with me, has, I am glad to say, adopted my views.

In the two specimens from "Wimpong in the British Museum, the

Hume's examples from the same locality the same curious diffe


rence of plumage is exhibited, and some of them even had a broad 

white collar on the back of the neck. This difference in coloration 

is probably seasonal; and any one studying the species should con

light brown, the secondaries rufous on their outer webs ; tail-feathers 
reddish brown, lighter brown at their ends, the outer ones 
more distinctly reddish towards their bases ; forehead and crown 
rufous, the hinder crown and nape black, the adjoining feathers of 
the crown black at base, rufous at tips; lores and a faintly indicated 
eyebrow ashy grey, with tiny whitish streaks on the latter; 
feathers round the eye ashy white; feathers below the eye ashy 
grey, minutely streaked with white; ear-coverts pale brown, with 
indistinct fulvescent shaft-lines; cheeks white, washed with ashy; 
throat and under surface of body white, with a shade of ashy on the 
breast, more distinct on the sides, the flanks also washed with ashy 
brown; under tail-coverts white; on the lower throat and fore 
neck some more or less distinct spots of dull ashy; under wing-
coverts and axillaries ashy white; quills dusky brown below, narrowly 
margined with white along the inner web; t4 bill horny, the 

lower mandible yellowish ; legs pale slate ; iris pale brown " (JR. G. 
Wardlaw Ramsay); " legs and feet and claws blue, varying in

shade from pale plumbeous to pale smalt-blue; upper mandible 
dark horny brown, lower mandible and often the edges of the upper 
mandible plumbeous blue, or white tinged with blue, fading to bluish 
white at the tip ; irides varying from carmine to orange-red, apparently 
according to age, as a younger bird has them pale sienna-
brown w (Davison). Total length 6*5 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 3*2, 
tail 2-8, tarsus 0*85. 

The amount of spotting on the throat varies with individuals, and 
extends sometimes up the whole of the chin, and downwards as 
far as the breast, giving a distinctly streaked appearance. Some 
birds, too, are much more dusky than others, less fulveseent brown 
on the back, and having less rufous on the rump and tail. This is 
especially noticeable in one of Capt. Wardlaw Ramsay's specimens 
from Sarawak (H Everett). 

According to Mr. Hume the males are larger than the females, 
having the wing 3*35 to 3*7 and the tarsus 0*9 to 0*95 inches, as 
against wing 3*2 to 3*25 and tarsus 0*8 to 0*9 in the hen bird. 

I could only find in Mr. Eyton's collection the single type of 

M. mayMIm (no. 2577 of his Catalogue, p. 194). The supposed 
female bird described by him was no longer in his cabinet at the 
time of his death: but there can be no doubt that it was a specimen 
of the small species M. cineream, as pointed out by Mr. Hume.

Adult male. General colour above brown, rather more dusky on 
tbe mantle and upper back, lighter and more fulvous-brown on the 
lower back and rump; upper tail-coverts light rufous; tail-feathers 
entirely rufous-brown, with lighter rufous edgings; wing-coverts 
like the back, tbe greater coverts dusky, externally like the back; 
quills dusky brown, externally dull olivaceous brown, the secondaries 
entirely of the latter colour; forehead and crown deep orange-rufous 
the feathers tipped with distinct spots of black: hinder crown and 
nape black; lores, feathers round the eye and above the ear-coverts 
ashy white, mottled with blackish margins to the feathers, the 
hinder part of the eyebrow fulvescent with paler shaft-lines; ear-
coverts pale fulvous with lighter shaft-streaks; cheeks, throat, and 
underparts pure white, with a slight ashy shade on the chest; thighs 
fulvous-brown; axillaries and under wing-coverts white, with ashyfulvous 
edges: quills dusky brown below, ash}- whitish along the ed^e 
of the inner web; " bill black, the mandible whitish lead-colour; legs 
and feet pale pinkish lead-grey; iris Indian red " {A. Everett). Total 
length 6 inches, culmen 0*65, wing 3, tail 2*5, tarsus 0*b. 

Adult female. Similar to the male in colour, and having the soft 
parts the same. Size rather smaller. Total length 5-3 inches, 
culmen 0*6, wing 2*8, tail 2*2, tarsus 0*8. 

This species is a diminutive of 3L magnum, from which it differs 
in its smaller size, somewhat paler coloration, more rufous tail, and 
in the lighter rufous of the forehead, the feathers of which are very 
distinctly tipped with black, scarcely any trace of which is visible 
in the larger species. The under surface wants the ashy spots on 
the throat, which are conspicuous in At. magmtm. 

In the Eyton collection were two types marked " original specimen 
" of Alalacoptiron cinereum of E) ton. One of these birds is 
fSctaria affinis (Blyth); and the other Is a Propartm or Aleippe> 
usually so called. It is impossible that either of these can be the 
actual type of if. cinereina; for Evton describes the species as 
being similar to the female of his AI. magnum, but much smaller. 
The iemale of 2L magnum he describes as fct smaller than the male 
with the head and nape ferruginous, spotted with Mack;' As Mr* 
Hume has surmised, the descriptions are taken from poorly prepared 
Malaccan skins. The male of AI. magnum is recognizable both 
from Eyton's description and his type; but the female (the type 
of which was missing from the Eyton collection) was evidently 
nothing but a male of the smaller species of rafbus-he&ded Afalacopteron; 
or it might be a specimen of the allied AI. Itpifi&eepkahm. 
This is quite probable, as the latter bird comes from Sumatra, and 
has the " head and nape rufous." Bad as the descriptions are, it is 
doubtful if Eyton would have overlooked the black nape of AL cineremn. 
I think, however, that Mr. Hume's explanation is the most 
feasible, \iz. that E}ton guessed at the sexes of AI. magnum, and 
that his supposed female was really a wale of the smaller kind; and 
thus the latter should stand as At. cinereum, the description of which 
is referable to the smaller species also.

the sexes do not differ in colour, bat only in size, and that 
the male is larger than the female. A bird collected by Mr. Crossley 
is probably a male, m it measures 0*7 in the culmen and 2*75 in 
the wing.

duller sienna; upper surface of the body olive-green, inclining to 
rufous on the sides of the neck; quills pale greyish brown, margined

dark horn-brown, nearly black on the upper mandible and on the 
basal half of the lower mandible; the tips of the latter and the edge 
of the former pale yellowish white; legs dark horn-brown, claws

The adult female does not differ from the male in plumage. 
Young birds resemble the ad alt, but differ in having the crown 
mu^h paler and more dingy chestnut, the under surface of the body 
olive-brown, inclining to yellowish along the breast, while the throat 
is yellowish instead of white; the upper mandible is dark horn-
brown, the lower one whitish ; the white eye-mark is wanting. 
The lurd when quite young is still more different, the upper surface 

• being entirely dingy olive without a trace of the rufous 
cap ; while 
underneath the colour is also dingy olive, with a broad yellow streak 
down the centre of the throat, the breast having a few rufous feathers 
intermixed. 
The specimens in the Museum vary in their measurements as 
follows:—Total length 6-6'5 inches, culmen 0*65-0-75, wing 2*42-
55, tail 2-25-2-6, tarsus 0*9-1. The smaller birds are probably 
the females, as the pair marked by Mr. Deans Cowan show a certain 
disparity in the size of the sexes.

Adult male. Above ashy brown with a slight wash of reddish or 
olive, the rump and upper tail-coverts rather more yellow; head 
light chestnut-red, with a bright yellow streak from the base of the 
bill above the eye; lores dusky ; ear-coverts and sides of neck dull 
yellowish; cheeks, throat, and under surface of body bright sulphur 
yellow, with narrow blackish-brown streaks on the cheeks, throat, 
and breast, the sides of the body greenish; under wing-coverts 
yellowish white, inclining to bright yellow near the edge of the 
wing; wings above reddish brown; the quills brown, externally pale 
reddish brown, much lighter than the coverts and slightly inclining 
to yellow; tail dull reddish brown, the shafts of the feathers decidedly 
reddish; bill horny; legs pale horny brown ; iris reddish hazel. 
Total length 4-3 inches, culmen 0*55, wing 2-15, tail 1*95, tarsus 
1-75. 

Obs. Considerable difference is exhibited in specimens from Burmah 
and Pegu, the back being more reddish brown, and the 
underparts lighter. This is contrary to Mr. Hume's experience 
(Str. E. iii. p. 118); but it is to be noted that Mr. Gates's account of 
the colouring of the soft parts is different from that given by Jerdon 
and quoted in my description. Mr. Oates writes :—" The irides are 
a sickly white; the eyelids plumbeous; the bill horny brown; the 
inside of the mouth fleshy brown; legs and feet fleshy horny; claws 
yellowish horny." Specimens examined by me from Pegu (Blanford) 
and Bhamo (Anderson) were decidedly brighter yellow than Xepalese 
examples, and had the gular streaks plainer as well as a certain 
tinge of rufous on the back, thus approaching the Malayan M. 
gularis. The pale winprs, however, show affinity to the Himalayan 
bird, of which the Pegu bird is a slightly aberrant form, as far as my 
experience goes. Mr. Hume has found that the specimens from 
Southern Tenasserim are the Malayan M. gularis, though some are 
intermediate between that species and M. rubricapilla.

Adult male. General colour above fulvous-brown, the dorsal 
plumes blackish, long, and hairy in structure, with conspicuous white 
shafts; upper tail-coverts reddish brown; tail-feathers blackish 
brown; wing-coverts like the back, the greater series dark brown, 
margined with the same colour as the back; quills deep brown, the 
secondaries externally margined with dull fulvous-brown; crown of 
head and nape bright chestnut; lores, eyelid, feathers below the eye, 
fore part of cheeks, and throat black; ear-coverts, hinder part of 
cheeks, sides of neck, and fore neck in front fulvous-brown, somewhat 
lighter on the fore neck and forming a partially pronounced collar, 
the ear-coverts and sides of neck faintly washed with rufous; behind 
the cheeks a half-concealed spot of white; remainder of under surface 
of body fulvous-brown, the flank-feathers elongated and with 
white shafts; centre of body ashy; axillaries and under wing-coverts 
like the breast, the lower series of the latter dusky brown; quills 
dusky brown below, paler along the edge of the inner web; " bill 
black; preorbital naked skin blue ; legs brown; iris crimson" (A.

black; legs blackish brown ; iris crimson " (Alfred Everett). Total 
length 6 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 2*65, tail 2*6, tarsus 0*9. 

In the young birds the plumage is not so deeply coloured as in 
the adults, the throat is dingy black, and there is little or no trace 
of the lighter golden-brown patch on the fore neck, which almost 
forms a collar in the adult. 

In some old birds the black throat extends on each side of the 
fore neck, forming as it were an elongated moustache.

Adult male. General colour above dusky olive-brown, becoming 
more reddish brown on the lower back and rump; mantle with 
indistinct pale shaft-lines ; upper tail-coverts rufous ; upper wing-
coverts like the back, the greater series somewhat washed with 
rufous on their margins ; quills sepia-brown, externally olive-brown, 
a little more rufescent on the secondaries; tail-feathers brown, 
slightly rufescent on the margins ; head dull ashy grey, contrasting 
with the back, and slightly washed with olive-brown; lores and 
eyelid ashy whitish; feathers over the eye ashy grey, extending 
above the ear-coverts; the latter pale fulvous with light shaft-lines; 
cheeks and entire throat dull white, with a few dusky streaks on 
the lower part of the latter; sides of breast washed with olive-brown; 
centre of breast and abdomen whitish; flanks, thighs, and under 
tail-coverts bright tawny buff; axillaries and under wing-coverts

inner web. Total length 4*7 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 2-65, tail 
1*35, tarsus 1*05. 

Adult female. Similar to the male in colour, but not quite so 
bright on the flanks; " bill smoky black, the lower mandible leaden-
grey; legs pale horn-brown; iris yellow-brown" (A. Everett). 
Total length 5 inches, culmen 0*75, wing 2*7, tail 1*4, tarsus 1*05. 

Obs. The streaks on the throat and chest vary very much in intensity, 
being sometimes very broad and of a dark slaty-grey colour. 
This species so closely resembles Anuropsis malaccensis, that it can 
easily be mistaken for it; but although it has the short tail of the 
latter species, it has the stout bill of a Turdinus, and the streaks 
on the throat are never seen at all in A. malaccensis.

Very great variation in the colour of this species seems to take 
place; but at present I am unable to account for the differences in 
colour except on the score of age. The sexes do not seem to differ 
in plumage; but the Bornean < birds are always richer hi tint

than the Malaccan. The tint of the upper surface varies from a 
strong olive-brown to fulvous-brown or even rufous-brown, the latter 
phase accompanied by a chestnut tail. I imagine that these rufous 
birds may be the young, as I have specimens before me both 
from Malacca and Borneo, and it is impossible to believe that 
they represent a distinct species. The bill is much paler in the 
rufous-coloured birds, and the under mandible conspicuously yellow, 
which appears to be another sign of nonage in a Timeliine 
bird. 

Another point of difference between specimens is to be seen in 
the distribution of the colour of the underparts. In some the white 
of the throat is continued unbroken to the abdomen; in others there 
is a faint shade of rufous on the chest ,* while in others the whole 
chest is orange-rufous, cutting off the white throat from the white 
abdomen.

Group IX. LIOTBICHES. 

The Hill Tits, as these birds are popularly called, are universally 
recognized bj writers on Indian ornithology as representing a distinct 
family of biids. I believe, however, that they are more 
correctly placed as aberrant Timeliiae forms, showing great affinities 
with the Paridce, the true Timeliidcf-, and even with the Wrens (Troglodytidce) 
; in SL less degree they are also allied to the Flycatchers.

it to S. ckrystea, to which it presents very little resemblance.

Adult. General colour above ashy olive-brown, a little more dingy 
on the mantle; wing-coverts like the back; quills brown, externally 
olive-brown ; tail-feathers light brown, narrowly edged with olive-
brown ; crown of head ochraceous brown, much lighter on the forehead, 
the shafts of the feathers black and stiffened, producing a 
bristly appearance; sides of face light ochraceous brown, the ear-
coverts somewhat ashy; a spot in front of the eye and chin black; 
remainder of under surface light ochraceous brown, the sides of the 
body washed with ashy; under tail-coverts ochraceous like the 
abdomen; under wing-coverts and axillaries white, washed with 
ochre near the edge of the wing; quills light brown below, white 


t This description occurs in a paper of Blyth's; and although the latter 
refers to the species as Mr. Hodgson's, the diagnoses would appear to be his 
own. Elyth, however, always seemed to regard the names as ha\ing been given 
by Mr. Hodgson in the passage referred to; and so it seems right to credit them 
to the latter.

fleshy brown; iris blood-red" (Jerdon). Total length 4*8 inches,' 
culmen 0*65, wing 2*1, tail 2, tarsus 0*8. 

A considerable diffeienee in the tone of colour in this species is 
observable, some individuals being so much more olive and others 
more rufeseent in shade. The palest examples are those from the 
North-west Himalayas. 

Young. Coloured like the adult, but much more fluffy in appearance 
and everywhere paler; the black shaft-lines on the head nearly 
obsolete.

* The following is a translation of Count SalvadorFs description of 8, 
bocagii:— 
Above greenish olive; head yellowish, the crown streaked with dusky; lores 
dusky; under surface of body yellow, the throat brighter; thesidt'b tinged with 
green; wings and tail dusky ashy grey, the outer margins of the feathers 
greenish olive; bill and feet du>ky; iris chestnut. Total length 4*3 inches, 
bill 045, wing 2, tail 1-75, tarsus 0*6*»>. (Halv^don.)

Inhabits the mountains of Sumatra. It w described by Count Salvador! as 
being allied to & chrysma, from which it differs in the greener shade of the 
upper surface, the du.sky streaks on the crown being le&s pronounced, the colour 
of the head greenish, le&s verging towards golden }el!ow, the lores dusk} instead 
of black, the less brilliant jellow of the belly, which is slightlyfi-reeniah, and by 
the tail being longer and duller in colour. 

2. OLIGTJBA. 
603 
Hal). A dull-coloured race of the Himalayan JY. cliryscea, from 
which it differs in the less vivid colour of the head and underparts, 
the back and wing-coverts being more of an ashy olive-colour, and 
the margins to the quills and tail-feathers much duller. I have not 
seen a specimen from Sumatra; and thus I cannot tell for certain 
whether the species from the hills of the latter island is identical 
with that of the Burmese and Tenasserim hills ; but it seems highly 
probable that this will prove to be the case. The Khasia birds in 
Colonel Godwin-Austen's collection also appear to be S. assimilis.

like the back. This is apparently a sign of immaturity, probably 
the dress of the young bird after its first moult, as Col. Grodwin-
Austen has specimens of both sexes correctly determined, and the 
hen bird shows scarcely any difference in plumage, the head bein<* 
yellow like the male. b 

Yotunj. Differs froin the adult in its nearly uniform dull coloration. 
The upper surface is olive-brown with a greenish tinge; 
the ear-coverts like the back, with a light olive-greenish streak

The female is white beneath, and the colour somewhat duller 
(Jerdon). I have not seen a properly identified female skin; but 
from the very evident way in which the colours of the present 
species become dim, I should have fancied that the paler birds were 
only faded specimens, and that the difference in colour mentioned 
by Jerdon was not sexual.

The two specimens from the Khasia hills in the British Museum 
belong to what is apparently a richly-coloured race. I have seen 
a bird from the Khasias and another from Assam in Capt. WardlawBamsay's 
collection, which agreed with the Museum birds in the 
much deeper and richer tint of the orange on the sides of the neck, 
without the straw-coloured shade which is conspicuous in Himalayan 
examples. The sides of the body, too, are more fulvescent 
brown, with more distinct whitish streaks, and the throat is purer 
white with the blackish shaft-lines well pronounced.

Mr. Hume described this bird as a typical Lculus, but he afterwards 
transferred it to the genus Siaphidia. The absence of white 
tips to the tail-feathers and the non-graduated tail would show, 
however, that it cannot be referred to the latter genus.

I 
have not seen a Tenasserim specimen of A. nipalensis, but 

Mr. Hume says that it occurs in that province. The specimens 

enumerated below are all referable, I believe, to A. phayrii; but 

in the Tenasserim 
birds there is scarcely a trace of the blackish 

streak on the sides of the crown which is very apparent in the 

specimens from Upper Burmah collected by Dr. Anderson : it never 

extends, however, so far down the sides ol the neck as in A, nipa-

Jensis. The ear-coverts are browner in A. phayrii than in the last-

named bird.

The female is smaller than the male, according to Capt. Yincent 
Legge. 
Captain Legge writes in his < Birds of Ceylon':—" There is a 
marked difference in the tint of the upper surface of this species 
according to the locality it inhabits. Examples from the south of 
the island and from the Western Province are rusty brown, while 
those from the colder climate of the upper hills are decidedly olivaceous 
on the back and wing-coverts; specimens from the north of 
Ceylon are, as a rule, intermediate between the two. Although 
individuals vary inter se in the amount of ferruginous tint present 
on the back, the up-country race will be found, as a whole, to be 
decidedly less rust-coloured than the low-country birds. The same 
character is exemplified in the Scimitar-Babbler (PomatorMaus mela


nurus)"

Adult. General colour above ashy grey, washed with olive-green 
on the lower back and rump• lesser and median wing-coverts ashy 
grey like the back; primary-coverts and greater series black, the 
former with a narrow yellow margin on some of the feathers; 
quills black, the outer primaries margined with yellow, becoming 
paler towards the end of the quills, the inner primaries not margined 
with yellow, the secondaries edged externally with golden yellow 
and tipped with white, the innermost broadly margined with white 
along the inner web ; tail-feathers ashy blackish, margined with 
golden yellow, broader near the base ; head a little darker than the 
back, blackish on the forehead and lores; ear-coverts and hinder 
cheeks silvery grey; base of cheeks and throat dusky, the feathers 
margined with silvery grey; under surface of body bright yellow, 
the inner aspect of the thighs dusky; axillaries and under wing-
coverts dusky with yellowish-white margins, the lower series white 
slightly tinged with yellow; quills blackish below, yellowish white

iris brown " (Jerdon). Total length 4 inches, culmen 0*4, wing 2*1, 
tail 1*9, tarsus 0*85. 

Like many of the Liotriehes, the present bird loses much of the 
brightness of its plumage from fading. Some of the examples in 
the Museum are nearly white below, and have lost the greater part 
of the yellow shade on the wings as well. One specimen has a 
streak of white running down the centre of the crown to the hind 
neck; but as none of the others in the collection of the Museum ro 
of Capt. Wardlaw Eamsay exhibit any peculiarity, I presume that 
it is a case of individual variety. 

Hah. Eastern Himalayas. 

* The name chrysotis is inapplicable to this species; and I think it must 
have been given by mistake for chryscBus, to which it was corrected later on by 
Mr. Hodgson. I have adopted the latter name in consequence, following 
Jerdon and others.

Young birds are much browner than the adult, especially on the 
crest, and the streaks on the throat are much narrower, smaller, 
and more indistinct. 

In the Museum series a good deal of variation is shown in the 
depth of colour in different individuals. Some of them have the 
orange on the wings and the fawn-colour of the abdomen duller 
in shade than others : they may be female birds.

Hah, Replaces 8. strigula of the Himalayas in Boo tan and the 
Burmese hills, ranging into Tenasserim. This is not so distinct a 
species as some of the Burmese representatives of Himalayan forms ; 
for the Bootan specimen in the British Museum is decidedly intermediate, 
having the chestnut extended, as in $. castaneicauda, on 
the centre tail-feathers but not on the next pair, while the rufous 
is of the deep tint of the Himalayan bird. I have examined Capt. 

"Wardlaw Ramsay's specimens of 8. castaneicauda from the Tonghoo 
hills, and also a skin from Tenasserim in his collection ; they agree 
with Mr. Hume's diagnosis, and are distinct enough from 8. strigula.

bird procured by him in Karen-nee, and I find that it bears out the 
characters given by Mr. Hume. It is much duller brown, and is 
only slightly brighter on the rump, showing none of the bright 
fulvous-brown of the Himalayan bird. The streaks on the head are 
scarcely perceptible, and there is no pronounced tinge of blue. The 
blue winglet shows no white tip, and the under surface is white 
instead of vinous-brown.

,W«fe. General colour above ashy olive, the head Hack, separated 
from the neck by a collar of orange feathers round the hind neck • 
wing-coveris like the back, the greater and primary-coverts narrowly 
fringed with yellow; quills dusky blackish, margined with golden 
yellow, inclining to paler yellow towards the ends of the primaries • 
the bases of the feathers washed externally with crimson forming 
a wing-patch; innermost secondaries dull ashy; upper tail-coverts 
crimson ; tail-feathers dusky ashy brown, blacker towards the ends 
of the feathers, which are margined with olive-yellow, brighter on 
the outer ones, the centre ones with a dusky edging towards the 
base; base of forehead bright yellow ; remainder of lores, feathers 
round the eye, cheeks, and a line below the ear-coverts black; ear-
coverts silvery white ; throat and chest bright orange; remainder of 
under surface olive-green, yellower down the centre of the body; 
under tail-coverts crimson; axillaries and under wing-coverts light 
olive, whitish at base, with a dark olive patch near the outer ed«-e 
of the wing, which is bright yellow; quills dusky brown below 
yellowish white along the edge of the inner web. Total length ' 
(> inches, culmen 0*7, wing 2*9, tail 2-65, tarsus 1. 

In \ery old males the throat has often a vermilion tint and the 
plumage is at all times brighter than in the females. The latter 
always seem to have the upper and under tail-coverts dull orange 
instead of crimson. The young birds resemble the females in their 
pale coloration, and have the upper and under tail-coverts coloured 
like the hen birds, but the head is dusky blackish or blackish brown 
washed with olive-yellowish. 

The colours in this species fade on exposure to the light, the olivecolour 
of the back shading into grey, the underparts into ashy white, 
while all the brilliancy of the bright portions of the wing and of the 
tail-coverts disappears.

Group X. ACCENT GEES. 

The position of the Accentors in the Order Passer i formes is by no 
means easy to define; they certainly have no relations with the 
Timeliidae, as they possess a very small first primary. Mr. Seebohm, 
however, has not*admitted them into his volume of the Turdidw, and 
in his latest work, the < History of British Birds/ he has placed them 
with the Paridce, from which family they are excluded by Dr. 
Gadow. I have been compelled, therefore, to place them in the 
present volume, although, like the Bradypteri and Thamnohicei they 
should, in my opinion, have been associated with other families. 

I follow Mr. Salvin (Cat. Strickl. Coll. p. 60) in placing Ephthianura 
with Accentor, to which it is most closely allied in external 
form, although the habits of the birds and the colour of their eggs 
differ in toto.

jXestlinr/. General colour above ochraceous buff, thickly mottled 
with black centres to the feathers, the hind neck and sides of the 
neck paler ; lesser and median coverts like the back ; greater coverts 
dusky brown, externally rufous and tipped with bright yellow-ochre;

Obs. I can perceive no actual difference in specimens from the 
British Isles and those of the continent of Europe. A male from 
Malta, killed in February 1854, is remarkable for its white throat 
spotted with dusky brown, and it has the breast dull ashy washed 
with brown. Whether it is a pale variety or merely the ordinary 
winter plumage of the young bird of the previous year, I am unable 
to define with certainty. 

The autumn plumage, after the moult, differs from the breeding-
plumage in being everywhere more rufous-brown. This is especially 
the case with the head, which is nearly of the same colour as the 
back and as distinctly mottled with blackish spots ; the grey shade 
on the eyebrow and sides of neck is also obscured by brown * the 
feathers below the eye and on the fore part of the ear-coverts are 
very distinctly streaked with white, and on the hinder part of the 
ear-coverts there is a distinct patch of rufous ; the under surface is 
more hoary grey, and the fore neck and chest arc both obscured by

are very broadly streaked with black.

Mr. Blanford remarks on the differences exhibited by a specimen 
from Persia, and considers it nearly allied to A. rubidus of Japan. 
I have not had the pleasure of examining Mr. Blanford's specimen, 
but it is probably the same as a bird in the Museum Collection from 
Batoum, which is remarkable for its uniform brown head. Unfortunately 
there is no date of capture attached to the specimen ; but it 
is in otherwise abraded plumage, and may be in worn breeding-garb. 
In this ease, however, the head should be grey, whereas it is brown* 
As this appears to indicate the existence of an Eastern race of the 
Common Hedge-Sparrow, I have thought it better to classify it as a 
distinct race, and perhaps the receipt of further specimens may demonstrate 
its claim to full specific rank. 

Hob. Apparently represents the Common Hedge-Sparrow from 
the eastern shores of the Black Sea to Persia.

Mr. Seebohm has remarked on the discrepancies between the 
specimens of the Japanese Hedge-Sparrow as figured by Gould and

that figured by Temminck and Schlegel. The latter bird is greyer 
below, and has no stripes on the flanks. He suggests that there 
may be two species in Japan, which appears very probable; andhave therefore separated the Hakodadi bird, as it seems to differ 
from the true A. rubidus of the c Eauna Japonica.'

with paler margins to the mantle-feathers, all of which are mesially 
broadly streaked with blackish brown; lower back aud rump uniform 
brown, rather more ashy on the upper tail-coverts; wing-
coverts brown, the median and greater series dusky, externally 
reddish brown, with moie or less distinct tips of ashy white; 
bastard-wing feathers dusky brown, edged with ashy whitish; primary-
coverts dusky brown, externally margined with ashy; quills 
brown, externally edged with reddish brown, paler towards the ends 
of the feathers, the secondaries narrowly fringed with whitish at 
the tips; the primaries margined along the outer web with whity 
brown; tail-feathers light brown, edged with ashy, and fringed 
along the edge of the inner web with the latter colour; crown of 
head dark ashy brown, with a blackish line skirting the sides of the 
crown, succeeded by a broad eyebrow of creamy buff or ilight 
ochraceous; lores, feathers round and below the e}Te, and ear-

coverts black ; sides of neck ashy grey; cheeks, throat, and breast 
ochraceous buff; the abdomen creamy white; sides of the breast 
chestnut-brown, the flanks also streaked with reddish brown; thighs 
ashy; under tail-coverts creamy white; under wing-coverts and 
axillaries pale cream-colour with ashy bases; quills ashy brown 
below, hoary whitish along the edge of the inner web. Total 
length 6 inches, culmen 0*45, wing 2*75, tail 2*o, tarsus 0*7. 


Adult female. Similar to the male, but with the colours a little 
duller, especially on the head, which is somewhat browner. Total 
length 5*3 inches, culmen 0*45, wing 2-S, tail 2'b, tarsus 0*7. 


The summer plumage is very much paler than that of autumn. 
In the latter the crown is much darker brown, the eyebrow and 
the throat are rich ochraceous, and the sides of the neck clear 
bluish grey, extending down towards the breast so as to form a 
sort of half-collar. The chestnut centres to the feathers on the sides 
of the breast are very strongly pronounced, so that this part appears 
mottled, and the stripes on the flanks are much more distinct. 
Breeding-birds obtained by Mr. Seebohm in the valley of the 
Yenesei have the plumage much worn and faded, the eyebrow and 
underparts being almost whitish.

Total length 6 inches, culmen 0*5, wing 3, tail 2*6, tarsus 0*8. 

A specimen from Irkutsk in Mr. Seebohm's collection appears to 
belong to the present species and not to A. montanellus. It is not 
so dark as the latter and has not the back rufous, but it is much 
darker than any specimen of A. fulvescens which I have seen, being 
rufescent underneath. It may be the young bird in its first 
autumn plumage. 

Eab. Central Asia, from Turkestan and Yarkand to the hills of 
Northern Cashmere. 

It appears to me to be probably this species, and not A. montanellus, 
which is said to have occurred in Sikhim. If this should 
prove to be the case, the latter bird will be found not to occur 
within Indian limits.

slightly shaded with ashy, and with more or less distinct margins 
of buffy-whitish endings to the greater and median series; bastard 
wing and primary-coverts dusky, narrowly margined with light 
brown; quills dusky brown, with pale margins of reddish brown, 
ashy on the primaries, much broader on the secondaries, which are 
ashy whitish round the ends; tail-feathers dusky brown, narrowly 
margined with ashy; crown of head and nape ashy brown; a narrow 
frontal line of black extending above the eye along the sides of 
the crown; lores, sides of face, ear-coverts, fore part of cheeks, and 
throat black; from above the hinder part of the eye a distinct streak 
of creamy white extending to the sides of the nape; sides of neck 
ashy ; hinder part of cheeks, lower throat, fore neck, and chest pale 
ochreous buff; remainder of under surface white; sides of the body 
browner, relieved by narrow streaks of blackish brown; under tail-
coverts white, with longitudinal centres of dusky brown; under 
wing-coverts and axillaries ashy, with longitudinal dusky centres; 
quills dusky below, ashy along the inner web; "bill black, yellowish 
at gape; legs and feet fleshy ; iris brown " (Scully). Total 
length 5*3 inches, culmen 0*4, wing 2-9, tail 245, tarsus 0*7. 

Obs. In the winter dress the black throat is very much obscured 
by the whitish margins to the feathers; the crown is altogether 
browner and not so grey as it is in summer; and the oehraceous 
colour of the fore neck and breast seems to vary considerably in 
richness and extent. 

There can be no doubt as to the identity of A. huttoni and A. 
atrigularis. I have compared a specimen from Kotegurh with 
others in Mr. Seebohm's collection from Samarcand and Turkestan. 


A female in Captain Wardlaw Eamsay's collection, collected by 
Dr. SevertzofT in Turkestan, on the 1st of November, has the black 
throat entirely obscured by whitish margins, so that it can only be 
discovered by lifting the feathers; the ear-coverts and head are 
much browner than in the male, but the fore neck and breast are 
much richer in colour and of a more rufous-ochre than in the latter, 
this bright colour extending also over the flanks. Total length 
5-5 inches, culmen 0-45, wing 2-8, tail 2*4, tarsus 0*7. 

Hab. The Altai mountains, Samarcand, and Turkestan, ranging 
into Afghanistan and the North-western Himalayas in winter.

with a large spot of white tipping each feather; secondary quills 
black, margined for the greater part of their length with yellowish 
brown, and broadly tipped with light chestnut, terminating with

Hah. Turkestan. 

Ohs. The description and measurements are from a specimen in 
Mr. Seebohm's collection. He received it from Dr. SevertzofT, by 
whom it is marked "A. rufilatus;" but -whether this name has ever 
been published I have been unable to find out. The Gilgit bird is 
certainly the same as the Turkestan race; and a specimen from the 
rTorth-west Himalayas is only slightly darken leading on to the

Adtdt male. General colour above dusky blackish brown, the 
mantle-feathers mixed with ashy brown, more distinct on hind neck; 
lower back ashy; wing-coverts dusky blackish brown, slightly mottled 
with dusky; the median and greater coverts margined and tipped with 
dull whitish ; bastard wing and primary-coverts dusky brown, narrowly

crimson or scarlet; the breast, sides of the body, and Hanks blightly 

mottled with white bases to the feathers ; thighs dull white, mottled 

with brown bases; abdomen and under tail-coverts white ; under 

wing-coverts and axillaries white with dusky brown bases; quills 

dusky below, inner edges whitish; " bill and feet blackish brown ; 

iris straw-white" (Gould). Total length 4 2 inches, culmen 0*55, 

wing 2*75, tail 1*55, tarsus 0*75. 

Specimens are very different in the colour of the back, which is 

often nearly uniform ashy, only slightly mottled with blackish brown. 

This is perhaps the winter plumage ; the tints on the head and 

breast are also of different shades of crimson or scarlet. 

Adult female. Browner than the male, and having the head 

ochreous brown; rump and upper tail-coverts less brilliant scarlet 

than in the male ; wings and tail as in the male ; throat white, as 

also breast, abdomen, and under tail-coverts: fore neck, chest, and 

sides of body pale ochreous brown. 

Young male. Eesembling the old female, but generally to be dis


tinguished by a slight tinge of rose-colour on the breast and on the 

head. Young females are only distinguished from the old hens by 

the more general ochreous colour of the upper parts, and also of 

the shade of the same colour which overspreads the lower surface of 

the body. 

With increasing age the crimson colour of the head and breast 
extends, but is never so vivid as in old males, nor does it spread so 
far over the breast; the rump-feathers in young birds often incline 
to saffron-yellow.

In my account of the range of this species (anted, p. 272), I stated 
that Cisticola erythrocephala from Coorg, which I had never seen, 
was " probably identical" with C. exilis. On his return to India 
Mr. Davison, who took great interest in my attempt to elucidate 
the confused synonymy of the Grass-Warblers, despatched a collector 
to the Brahmagherries for the purpose of obtaining a series of 

C. erythrocephala for the British Museum. Unfortunately all the 
specimens he procured were in winter plumage, most of them being 
clean-moulted, but two still retaining portions of the yellow immature 
plumage of the previous autumn. On comparing them with

the fine series of -winter specimens in the Museum from Australia, 
I find that they appear to be identical in every particular, and 
that I was justified in placing 0. erythrocephala as a synonym of 

0. eocilis.

and breast ashy grey; fore part of neck, breast, and middle of abdomen 
white; middle of the throat margined with black on both 
sides; sides of the abdomen and under tail-coverts brown; wings 
dusky black; lesser and median wing-coverts broadly tipped with

3-6, tail 2-55, bill 0-6, tarsus 1-35. 

Adult female. Like the male but a little smaller, and distinguished 
by its rufous throat. 

Obs. The reddish brown on the chin and throat is much more 
restricted than in 0. spinicauda, scad the remarkable black colour 
on the sides of this reddish brown is altogether wanting; the sides 
of the body, breast, and belly entirely grey, with only a few white 
feathers on the latter. Further, the brown of the upper parts is 
as rich as in 0. spinicauda, and the black colour more strongly 
developed. The white spots on the wing are absent (Meyer).
