PREFACE 



James Lee Peters began his association with the Museum of Compara- 

 tive Zoology while still a Harvard student, and after graduating in 1912 

 served the MCZ in voluntary capacities at various times for fifteen years. In 

 1 92 1 he was appointed an "associate" of the museum. One of his duties was 

 to prepare, under the direction of Outram Bangs, Curator of Birds, a card 

 catalogue of the MCZ bird collection, following Bowdler Sharpe's Hand-list of 

 the Genera and Species of Birds (1899- 1909). This was a tedious task in 

 view of the size of the existing collection and the avalanche of new speci- 

 mens pouring into the museum. The job was made especially complicated by 

 the many new taxa that had been described since Sharpe's time and also 

 because ornithological systematics was coming of age and many of Sharpe's 

 "species" were now recognized as taxa of polytypic species. As Peters tried 

 to reconcile Sharpe's increasingly obsolescent Hand-list with the then-current 

 taxonomy, it was apparent that it was time for a new compilation. It is not 

 known precisely when Peters decided to prepare such a work, but probably it 

 was in 1927, tne year in which Thomas Barbour, a vigorous, enthusiastic, and, 

 above all, actively supportive person, became Director of the MCZ and a 

 rejuvinated museum began to reflect the traits of its new leader. The year 

 1927 also marks the time Peters moved from "associate" status to that of 

 Assistant Curator of Birds. 



Volume I of the Check-list of Birds of the World, published by Harvard 

 University Press, appeared in 1931, a year before the death of Outram Bangs 

 and the subsequent appointment of Peters as full Curator of Birds. Six suc- 

 ceeding volumes came out at roughly three-year intervals, the first five 

 under the imprint of Harvard University Press and the sixth issued by the 

 MCZ in 1951. To this point 2,300 pages had been published, or about 

 one-third of the eventual total. Even if he could have maintained this rate 

 Peters might have been in his nineties when Volume XV completed the 

 project. However, around the late 1940's, apparently recognizing the unlikely 

 prospect that he would finish his monumental task, Peters had asked his good 

 friend John T. Zimmer, an equally meticulous worker, to prepare the 

 manuscript for the Tyrannidae, which was to occupy much of Volume Vlll. It 

 is not known whether Peters had planned to ask for assistance from other 

 ornithologists. He was at work on Volume IX when he died suddenly in April 

 1952 at the age of 62. 



The following year James C. Greenway, Jr., who had been at the MCZ 

 since 1930, became Curator of Birds and assumed responsibility for com- 

 pleting the Check-list. The year 1953 also marked the arrival at the 

 museum of Ernst Mayr, as Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology; and he 

 joined Greenway's efforts to complete "Peters' Check-list." Together they 




solicited manuscripts from a number of specialists and in 1957 

 secured a grant from the National Science Foundation for a revolving 

 fund to help finance the publication by the MCZ of the remaining volumes. 

 Unfortunately, John T. Zimmer died this same year and before his manuscript 

 had been edited. 



It is interesting to observe how after the death of Peters the project 

 expanded from one man's useful, carefully prepared compilation into an 

 international effort whose collaborators specialized in certain families and, at 

 times, even particular geographical areas within these families. Eventually 33 

 ornithologists were to be involved in the completion of this work. 



Because manuscripts were not always available in the sequence in which 

 the families were to be ordered and the volumes numbered, publication was 

 whenever the manuscripts for a given volume were ready. Volume IX 

 appeared in i960 and Volume XV in 1962, both under the editorship of Mayr 

 and Greenway. While Volume XV was in press Greenway left the MCZ and 

 Raymond A. Paynter, Jr., who had been Greenway's assistant since 1953, 

 became Curator of Birds and assumed an active role in editing future 

 volumes and handling the business aspects of the growing project. Volume X, 

 jointly edited by Mayr and Paynter, came out in 1964. In 1967, 1968, and 

 1970, Volumes XII, XIV, and XIII, edited by Paynter, were published. Melvin 



A, Traylor, Jr., Curator of Birds at Field Museum of Natural History, 

 assumed the editorship for Volume VIII, the bulk of which contained Zimmer's 

 long-awaited treatment of the Tyrannidae, and this appeared in 1979. 



Volume I, coming at the beginning of the project while Peters was 

 honing his skills and establishing a pattern, had become badly obsolete. It 

 was decided that a completely rewritten second edition was needed. Thirteen 

 collaborators prepared manuscripts under the editorship of Mayr and of G. 

 William Cottrell, who had been associated with the MCZ since i960. The 

 second edition of Volume 1 was published in 1979. This was followed in 1986 

 by Volume XI, also under the editorship of Mayr and Cottrell, which, except 

 for this Comprehensive Index, completed the project that had been conceived 

 more than six decades earlier. 



As J, L. Peters' successor at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, I 

 am, of course, pleased that this huge and lengthy project has finally been 

 finished. The Check-list must stand as a monument to the initiative and 

 commitment of Peters. However, it should also be remembered that two- 

 thirds of the Check-list represents an outstanding example of a cooperative, 

 international endeavor, on a scale unique in ornithology, and that its com- 

 pletion is a tribute as well to the 32 other dedicated authors and editors 

 who took time from research of their own in order to finish this work.

INTRODUCTION 



This Comprehensive Index is a compilation of all indices in the Check- 

 list series, with the exception of that from the first edition of Volume I. 

 Misspellings, omissions, and other errors detected in the indices have been 

 corrected, but not those from within the texts. A few synonyms that I know 

 to have been overlooked are cited in the Addenda to this volume and are 

 indexed here, but no consideration is given to names coined subsequent to 

 the publication of the relevant volume. It is a tribute to the authors that 

 not a single homonym has been found in the approximately 55,000 entries 

 that constitute this index. 



In this, the final volume in a series that has been appearing at 

 intervals for nearly six decades, it seems appropriate to take a brief 

 overview of the project and to examine some of the tenets and conven- 

 tions, as well as the problems, that have guided and confronted the authors 

 and editors. 



From the outset this Check-list did not attempt to give complete 

 synonymies, but rather picked up from the date of the last such compilation. 

 For example, in early volumes only names synonymized since Sharpe's 

 Hand-list (1899-1909) were included; later in the series the suitable volume in 

 Hellmayr's Catalogue of Birds of the Americas (1924-1949) or in Hartert's Die 

 Vogel der paldarktischen Fauna (1903-1938) was taken as the starting point 

 for new synomyns. 



In the beginning, bibliographic references to taxonomic revisions, or 

 other major studies, were given under each genus. In time this was altered 

 so that important works were listed only once under the family heading, 

 and the bibliographies under the generic heading were expanded to include 

 biological as well as taxonomic works. 



English vernacular names were tried in Volume IX, in an attempt to 

 make the work more accessible to non-taxonomists. The selection of these 

 names evoked so much criticism from those it was meant to help that the 

 effort was abandoned . 



Over the course of the entire Check-list project, the authors and 

 editors had to wrestle with two vexatious major problems that were the 

 result of the rapidly advancing state of avian taxonomy. The first problem 

 was that of the sequence in which the taxa, particularly at the familial 

 level, were to be ordered. The second problem was concerned with the hier- 

 archical rank assigned to the higher taxa, again particularly at the familial 



ix 




level. Although the paramount function of the Check-list has been to 

 inventory and outline the distribution of the world's avifauna, rather than to 

 provide a classification of the Class Aves, its taxonomy, inevitably, has been 

 considered authoritative. However, the user of the Check-list who is not a 

 systematist needs to be reminded that the six decades during which these 

 volumes were prepared was a period of immense change in taxonomic 

 practice and theory. While the taxonomy employed in each volume generally 

 represented a consensus for that time, in many instances current opinion 

 would be quite different. 



When Peters began his work, he faced the problem of deciding in what 

 sequence to arrange the families and higher categories. He elected to follow 

 the arrangement that had been proposed by Wetmore (1930, Proc. U. S. Nat'l 

 Mus., 76, art. 24, 8 pp.), and that was to be used in the fifth edition of the 

 American Ornithologists' Union's Check-list of North American Birds (1931). 

 Peters died before reaching the Passeriformes, but had he lived and followed 

 the Wetmore sequence, the Check-list would have concluded with the 

 corvines (birds of paradise, crows, etc.), followed by the ten-primaried Old 

 World insect-eater assemblage (Old World flycatchers. Old World warblers, 

 thrushes, etc.), and ultimately ending with the nine-primaried New World 

 assemblage (tanagers, troupials, New World finches, etc.). This order within 

 the passerines had been proposed first by Wetmore and Miller (1926, Auk, 

 43:337-346) but, except for a reversal in the sequence of the Old World and 

 New World groups, it was generally similar to much earlier American 

 arrangements (e.g., Coues, 1873, Check List of North American Birds) in that 

 the corvines were well forward in the sequence and did not terminate the 

 list as was customary elsewhere in the world. 



Although the American arrangement of passerine families differed 

 markedly from the sequences used, for example, in Europe or Africa, even 

 these other classifications differed somewhat among themselves. Therefore, 

 in 1954 the president of the XI International Ornithological Congress in Basel 

 appointed a multinational committee of seven to recommend a standardized 

 sequence for the passerines. The result of these deliberations is given by 

 Mavr and Greenway (1956, Breviora, Mus. Comp. Zool. Harvard, no. 58, 11 

 pp.); this is the so-called "Basel sequence" which has been followed in this 

 series in the years since the death of Peters. Regrettably, there is still no 

 world-wide agreement and the divergencies are as wide today as they were 

 more than thirty years ago. 



The second vexing problem, that of the hierarchical ranking of the 

 higher taxa, was much more difficult to confront, not only because of its 

 subjective nature, but also because of constantly changing criteria, differing 

 kinds of evidence considered to be useful in ranking taxa, and, finally, 

 perhaps most importantly, the waxing and waning of the influence of various 

 avian taxonomists. There were, of course, the continuing problems in 

 determining specific and generic limits, problems that doubtless will exist for 

 many more years, but taxonomic turbulence is particularly evident in the 

 treatment of the Muscicapidae. As indicated by Mayr and Greenway (1956, 

 op. cit.), it was orginally planned to treat the Old World insect-eaters as a 




xi 



single, broad family, the Muscicapidae, with the thrushes, babblers, warblers, 

 monarchs, flycatchers, etc., each as a subfamily. In Volumes X (1964), XII 

 (1967), and XIII (1970) this plan was followed, but a decade and a half later, 

 there was evidence, primarily biochemical, suggesting that it would be better 

 to treat each group as a full family. As a consequence, in Volume XI (1986) 

 the Old World flycatchers are raised to the "Muscicapidae isensu stricto)," 

 the warblers to the Sylviidae, the Australasian wrens or warblers to the 

 Maluridae, and the monarchs to the Monarchidae; the Platysteiridae, Acan- 

 thizidae, and Eopsaltriidae also appear for the first time. Stasis has not set 

 in even after fifty-five years. However, although these changes are conspic- 

 uous, it should be emphasized that two issues, differing greatly in impor- 

 tance, are involved, viz., the delimitation of taxa and their ranking. To 

 have a correct and preferably stable delimitation of taxa is important. But, 

 on the other hand, whether the recognized taxa are ranked as tribes, 

 subfamilies, or families is of relatively minor significance. 



To those seeking a comfortable standard classification such back-flips 

 will be unsettling, confusing, and doubtless annoying. On the other hand, 

 ornithological systematics is still a lively, controversial topic. Surely no one 

 connected with any aspect of this Check-list has ever believed his contribu- 

 tion represented the final word. In fact, as is often said, perhaps defen- 

 sively rather than with real conviction, the greater the contribution made by 

 a scholarly work, the more rapidly it becomes obsolete.
