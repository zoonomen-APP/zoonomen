INTRODUCTION 



It is now nearly thirty- two years since the first volume of 

 Sharpe's Handlist of the Genera and Species of Birds made 

 its appearance. The five volumes comprising that work have 

 long been the one and only standard catalogue available 

 to ornithologists, and it is a pity that Sharpe's work could 

 not have remained so, but the rapidity of the increase of orni- 

 thological knowledge has made it clear for a number of years 

 that a new work along the same, or perhaps shghtly more 

 elaborate, lines was needed. 



The order of families and higher groups followed in this 

 work is essentially the same as that proposed by Wetmore 

 in the Proceedings XJ. S. National Museum, 76, Art. 24, 1930, 

 pp. 1-8. The arrangement of the subfamilies and the sequence 

 of genera and species have been compiled from many sources 

 and from personal examination of material. The much- 

 mooted question of generic limits is largely a matter of indi- 

 vidual preference. In the recognition of genera I have en- 

 deavored to adhere to the doctrine that 'Hhe genus should 

 be used for expressing relationships," and that minor struc- 

 tural differences should be considered as of specific value 

 only, or at the most merely of subgeneric worth. 



The fact that a species or subspecies is included does not 

 necessarily mean that I am in a position to vouch for its 

 validity; nor when a name is relegated to synonymy does it 

 mean that the form is unrecognizable (unless, of course, the 

 name is a direct synonym) . In a work such as this which con- 

 tains a large amount of compilation, it is clearly impossible to 

 be critical throughout and it is absolutely necessary to refer 

 freely to the opinions of sound ornithologists. Where a con- 

 flict of opinion exists I have tried to follow my own best 

 judgment. In recognizing representative forms as subspecies, 

 even where physical intergradation does not occur, or where 




VI INTRODUCTION 



intergradation by individual variation is not complete, I 

 think my own views are entirely in harmony with those of 

 most progressive ornithologists. 



In giving the ranges I have endeavored to outline con- 

 cisely the normal range of each bird, and whether or not it is 

 migratory; specific instances of casual or accidental occur- 

 rence are considered to be outside the scope of a list of this 

 character. 



For each genus I have endeavored to give one or more 

 references to recently published revisionary work, geographic 

 lists, or to works where the principal synonymy of the genus 

 may be found. In large genera there may be several such 

 references, while in a small genus one or two suffice. In short, 

 these references may be regarded as the basis on which the 

 treatment of the genus and species rests. 



It must be clearly understood by all users of this work 

 that it does not include a complete principal synonymy. 

 Synonyms, both generic, specific and subspecific, are given 

 only for genera, species and subspecies described since the 

 publication of the first volume of Sharpe's Handlist. In many 

 cases where the Handlist recognized as valid a form since rele- 

 gated to synonymy, that fact is stated in a footnote. Syno- 

 nyms not to be found in any of the volumes of the Catalogue of 

 Birds of the British Museum are cited in full. References also 

 in full are given for each genus and species recognized. In the 

 large majority of cases such references have been personally 

 verified. 



Within each genus the species have been arranged in phylo- 

 genetic sequence as nearly as can be determined; subspecies 

 are arranged geographically from North to South and from 

 West to East. 



Fossil birds are regarded as being outside the scope of this 

 Check-list, which deals with recent birds only. To maintain 

 the continuity of the classification as far as possible, the fossil 

 orders and famihes have been included in their properplace, 

 but printed in Gothic type. It has been necessary to draw a 




INTRODUCTION Vll 



line somewhere between fossil and recent birds, and for this 

 purpose any bird is considered as belonging among the fossils 

 if it is not known from at least a fragment of the skin and 

 feathers. Recent species now known to be extinct are indica- 

 ted by a dagger (f). 



The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature has been 

 followed except in the application of Article 28. Where two 

 names are of the same date, and it has been or can be proven 

 that one of them is actually the prior name, even if only a 

 matter of line anteriority on the same page, then I have 

 used the prior name, regardless of the action of some "first 

 reviser." 



No names have been included that have been published 

 since December 31, 1930. The manuscript was sent to the 

 printer late in January, 1931, and it has seemed best to close 

 it to birds described after January first. One or two of my 

 friends have given me advance information of new birds in 

 manuscript, suggesting that the names be published as 

 nomina nuda in this list in advance of their descriptions. 

 This practice was very common seventy-five or a hundred 

 years ago and led to much confusion in later years. It should 

 not be attempted as late as 1931. 



In the preparation of this volume I have received aid and 

 encouragement from numerous friends. First and foremost 

 it gives me great pleasure to acknowledge a debt of gratitude 

 to Outram Bangs, an outstanding figure in Ornithology for 

 over thirty years, whose kindly help and wise counsel have 

 helped me over many a difficult group. 



Thomas Barbour, Director of the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoology, has long encouraged me in the belief that this Check- 

 list could be printed under the auspices of the University. 



Proofs have been read in whole or in part by Mr. H. 

 B. Conover, Dr. Herbert Friedmann, Dr. C. E. Hellmayr, 

 Dr. Ernst Mayr, Dr. Robert Cushman Murphy, Dr. C. W. 

 Richmond, Dr. Alexander Wetmore and Mr. J. T. Zimmer. 

 Miss Eleanor K. Sweet, Librarian at the Museum of Com- 




VIU INTRODUCTION 



parative Zoology, has also carefully read the proofs and de- 

 tected many inconsistencies in citation of titles of both books 

 and serials. To Dr. Roberto Dabbene was submitted the 

 manuscript covering the Rheas and the Argentine species of 

 Tinamiformes. Mr. W. B. Alexander read over the part of 

 the manuscript dealing with the Pelicaniformes and made 

 numerous valuable suggestions; Dr. Erwin Stresemann per- 

 formed the same service for the genus Accipiter; Mr. J. H. 

 Fleming, Dr. Einar Lonnberg, Mr. W. L. Sclater, and Dr. B. 

 Stegmann have helped me with specific inquiries. To Mr. 

 Thomas E. Penard of Arlington, Massachusetts, I am in- 

 debted for access to his private library containing several 

 rarities not otherwise available in the vicinity of Cambridge. 

 I am also indebted to the authorities of the American Mu- 

 seum of Natural History, Academy of Natural Sciences, and 

 the United States National Museum for the privilege of ex- 

 amining material in their respective institutions. I should be 

 most remiss in my acknowledgments if I did not express my 

 appreciation of the devotion of Mrs. R. E. Bowen, Secretary 

 to the Bird Department at the Museum of Comparative 

 Zoology, who painstakingly typed the entire manuscript and 

 performed much other tedious clerical work in connection 

 with the undertaking.

 maintained and a genus created, for exilis.

1 I believe it best to follow the treatment of this genus as constituted by 

 Hartert and by Phillips. The only other alternative is to break it up into a large 

 number of genera and subgenera, each one monotypic. It does seem, however, 

 that the "Widgeons" constitute a small, well-defined group, so I maintain 

 Mareca, and for similar reasons Chaulelasmus, is also kept distinct.

 Asturina saturata Sclater and Salvin is placed in the genus Buteo as has been

In the same paper, Portenko divides the different subspecies of the palaearctic 

 Buteos each into a number of color varieties, employing a quadrinomial form of 

 terminology to designate them, i. e., Buteo japonicus japonicus Temminck f. 

 pallidipectus. In such cases it is quite evident that no nomenclatorial value is 

 to be attached to the fourth term, nevertheless the practice of designating 

 color varieties in this way may lead to serious complications and should be 

 avoided.

^ Hypomorphnus must replace Urubitinga. Urubitinga was used in a vernac- 

 ular sense by the French ornithologists from Cuvier's time onward, but its use 

 was always in the vernacular and it was never validated as a generic name prior 

 to 1840. In that year G. R. Gray, in his List Gen. Bds., p. 2, cited Urubitinga 

 in a generic sense as a synonym of Morphnus Cuvier, rendering it untenable 

 from that date. 



2 In my opinion the short-legged, short-tailed species with more slender bills 

 formerly associated with H^Jponlorphnus vrubitinga are not very closely related 

 to it. They are, however, not generically separable from Buteogallus, formerly 

 considered monotypic.

^ The renaming of Falco bacha Daudin was uncalled for. Levaillant's plate 

 and description on which the name is based agree closely with the Spilornis 

 from the Malay Peninsula. Levaillant's account of the habits of "Le Bacha" 

 and the region it was supposed to inhabit undoubtedly refer to a Spizaetus or 

 one of the closely allied genera, but that is no reason for discarding a name 

 based exclusively on a recognizable plate. If names are thrown out simply be- 

 cause the type locality is erroneous, many more names among the early authors 

 would find their way into the discard.

1 Menzbier, supra, p. 59, cites this name in an array of "Faunistic Literature 

 relating to Russia" but does not dispose of it definitely in synonymy. Menz- 

 bier's method of handling subspecies is one all his own. He divides Falco p. 

 peregrinus into a number of "forms" including F. p. p. f. griseiventer, f. comi- 

 cum, f. abietinus, and f. brevirostris. 



^ Hartert (supra) and Menzbier (supra) are entirely at variance in their 

 views on the forms of Peregrine Falcon in Asia. I have followed the former's 

 treatment, but the occurrence in China of certain anomalous specimens leads 

 to the belief his views are not entirely correct.
