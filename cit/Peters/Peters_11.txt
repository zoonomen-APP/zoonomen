INTRODUCTION 



Volume XI completes the Check -list of Birds of the World. 

 Fifty-five years, thus, have passed between Volume I (1931) 

 and this volume. When originally planned, Volume XI was to 

 cover the "Old World Warblers (Sylviidae) and Old World Fly- 

 catchers (Muscicapidae)." These two groups were not only ac- 

 knowledged to be difficult, containing some very troublesome 

 genera (like Phylloscopus and Cisticola), but had never been 

 treated in their entirety since the Catalogue of the Birds of 

 the British Museum, Volumes IV (1879), V (1881), and VII 

 (1883). 



The terms "warblers" and "flycatchers," as is now thought, 

 designate the occupants of particular feeding niches. They do 

 not necessarily refer to near relationship. The New World rep- 

 resentatives of these two niches, the wood warblers (Paruli- 

 dae) and the tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), have long been 

 separated from the Old World groups (Sylviidae and Musci- 

 capidae), and this separation has not been challenged. The 

 designation Muscicapidae was used in Check-list, Volumes X 

 (1964) and XII (1967), in the broad sense of Hartert. It in- 

 cluded thrushes, babblers, whistlers, and numerous aberrant 

 groups. None of these is any longer included in the Musci- 

 capidae as now delimited on the basis of the researches of 

 Charles G. Sibley and others. Furthermore, it had long been 

 suspected that the Australian warblers and flycatchers had 

 no relationship to the Sylviidae and Muscicapidae, even though 

 in their most conspicuous morphological characters (e.g., shape 

 of bill) they were very similar indeed. Thus, in the absence of 

 positive distinguishing characters and uncertainty as to other 

 allocation, they were generally left with the Afro-Eurasian 

 families. In recent years, however, the artificiality of this ar- 

 rangement was so apparent that it became customary to rec- 

 ognize two indigenous families for the Australasian warblers, 

 Maluridae and Acanthizidae, one family for the monarch fly- 

 catchers (Monarchidae), a sub-taxon for the fantail flycatch- 

 ers (Rhipidurinae), and a family for the Australasian robins

(Eopsaltriidae). Although these taxa are on the whole reason- 

 ably well characterized by life history characters and general 

 habitus, there are few (if any) diagnostic morphological char- 

 acters. Fortunately, the DNA hybridizing technique of Charles 

 G. Sibley permits the establishment of a tentative classifica- 

 tion of all the Australasian genera and families. Even though 

 future modifications of this arrangement are not precluded, 

 the scheme of branching pattern suggested by Sibley has been 

 adopted by us. We regard it as a secure basis for future re- 

 search. 



Determination of the best possible sequence of taxa and their 

 ranking has always been a particular difficulty with avian 

 species and genera. There is no regular progression from more 

 primitive to more specialized types; indeed, a bush would rep- 

 resent avian phylogeny much more realistically than a tree. 

 The problem the avian cataloguer has to solve is in what se- 

 quence to list the branches of this bush. Evidently an almost 

 unlimited number of alternative arrangements is possible. In 

 our own choice of the sequence we have attempted to follow 

 three time-honored principles: (1) each species (genus) is listed 

 as near to its closest relatives as possible, (2) taxa with seem- 

 ingly more ancestral ("primitive") characters are listed before 

 those with more derived characters, and, most importantly, (3) 

 widely accepted sequences are retained for the sake of stabil- 

 ity, unless it can be clearly shown that they are contradicted 

 by definite evidence. We do not doubt that the application of 

 new molecular methods will in due time necessitate numbers 

 of changes from the sequence and categorical ranks adopted 

 by us. 



The Australasian families provided a particularly difficult 

 problem. There was hardly a subspecies without at least one 

 or several synonyms, mostly made by Gregory M. Mathews. 

 Mayr decided to list in the synonymy all those names that 

 were clearly without any merit whatsoever. A difficulty arose 

 with respect to a second group of names, names given to slightly 

 differing populations, particularly such on extensive clines. In 

 reaction to Mathews' uninhibited splitting, some recent Aus- 

 tralian authors have gone to the opposite extreme and have 

 recognized as subspecies only well-isolated populations with 

 well-defined diagnostic characters, synonymizing all minor 

 subspecies. Ultimately this may indeed be the most sensible 




INTRODUCTION vii 



policy. Mayr decided, however, not to follow this course, since 

 he felt that at this time it would be of more help to make a 

 distinction between altogether-useless names and those of mi- 

 nor races. In due time, it may become the tradition to recog- 

 nize only very well-marked subspecies, but by then the work- 

 ers on Australasian birds will have learned that the names 

 synonymized in this volume are altogether without merit. Since 

 the first draft in the 1950s much splendid work on the clas- 

 sification of Australasian birds has been done by Julian Ford, 

 Allen Keast, Shane Parker, R. Schodde, G. M. Storr, and oth- 

 ers, and the early drafts had to be revised repeatedly. There 

 still are differences of opinion, even among the Australian 

 workers themselves, and no doubt the listing as presented here 

 is not the last word. In any case, Mayr feels that the group of 

 active young Australian ornithologists should be considered 

 the real authors of the parts on Australasian birds in this vol- 

 ume rather than himself. 



The contributions of the three authors of this volume are 

 divided on a geographical basis. Melvin Traylor is responsible 

 for the treatment of the African taxa, George Watson for the 

 Holarctic and Oriental taxa, and Ernst Mayr for the Austral- 

 asian taxa. 



Work on the African and Australasian portions was begun 

 in the 1950s, and Mayr over the years mailed various drafts 

 of the Maluridae, Acanthizidae, Monarchidae, and Eopsaltri- 

 idae to H. T. Condon, Julian Ford, A. Keast, A. R. McGill, G. 

 F. Mees, Shane Parker, R. Schodde, D. L. Serventy, and G. M. 

 Storr. Murray Bruce has made valuable contributions to the 

 treatment of Wallacean taxa. Portions of the African material 

 were read by C. W. Benson, B. P. Hall, and M. P. Stuart Irwin. 



The editors wish to acknowledge, with deep appreciation, 

 the contribution made by Raymond A. Paynter, Jr. in fur- 

 thering the printing of the volume, as well as the expert ed- 

 itorial assistance of Helen Phillips, once again available, and 

 the secretarial contribution of Alison Pirie.

2 The greenish-backed subspecies sepium and sundaicus have usu- 

 ally been considered conspecific with the gray-backed forms of ruf- 

 iceps. They differ markedly in color, and on Java, where ruficeps and 

 sepium have been found almost sympatrically, they differ in habitat, 

 so that it seems more reasonable to treat them as two distinct species 

 in a superspecies. — G. E. W.

 green and yellow tendencies pronounced in the west and brown and 

 white in the east, the distributions are not exclusive; some Scot- 

 tish breeding birds are very similar to yakutensis, and morphologi- 

 cally eastern birds have been recorded on migration in western Eu- 

 rope and Britain and in winter in western Africa; see discussion in

 sis of structural, vocal, and egg-color characters. Many of the char- 

 acters show an approach to Lusciniola or Acrocephalus and account 

 for Seebohm's (1881, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., 5, p. 121) treating Her- 

 bivocula as a subgenus of Lusciniola. Ticehurst, 1938, p. 96, dem- 

 onstrated that most of the structural characters were also found in 

 armandii; Meise, 1934, Abh. Ber. Mus. Tierkunde Volkerkunde

 feldt and Vietinghoff-Scheel, 1980, Atlas Verbreitung Pal. Vogel, Lief. 

 8, on the basis of both field and museum experience concluded that 

 schwarzi, armandii, and probably griseolus ought to be in the same 

 subgenus. Since Seebohm adopted Herbivocula, which has page prior- 

 ity over Oreopneuste (type armandii), as the subgenus for all the dusky 

 leaf warblers of Asia, it hardly seems worthwhile to resuscitate the 

 unused name Phaeorhadina Mathews and Iredale (1917, Austral Avian 

 Rec, 3, p. 116, type Phillopneuste [sic] fuscata) for fuscatus, fuligi- 

 venter, and affinis, which do not differ in any major way from ar- 

 mandii and had usually been placed in the subgenus Oreopneuste 

 with armandii and griseolus. — G. E. W.

 idipennis Blyth, 1855, Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 24, p. 275 — Ten- 

 asserim, with this species led Oates, 1889, pp. 420-421, and Tice- 

 hurst, 1938, p. 178, to reject uiridipennis as a nomen dubium. See 

 other comments by Hume, 1877, Stray Feathers, 5, pp. 330-333. The 

 name is also now a nomen oblitum. — G. E. W. 



2 Wolters, 1980, Vogelarten Erde, 5. Lief, p. 363, suggests that dav- 

 isoni hybridizes with reguloides in northern Burma and Assam (= 

 P. r. assamensis Hartert). — G. E. W.

1 Cryptolopha [= Phylloscopus] flavigularis Bourns and Worcester, 

 1894, is not preoccupied by Abrornis [= Seicercus] flavogularis God- 

 win-Austen, 1877. Thus, Dubois' proposal of the substitute name ce- 

 buensis was unjustified. However, since the name cebuensis has been 

 in unchallenged use for more than 50 years (actually 85 years) it has 

 acquired the status of a nomen conservandum. — E. M. 



2 The taxonomy of the Phylloscopus trivirgatus complex is still in 

 flux. We recognize a superspecies, P. trivirgatus, with trivirgatus, 

 sarasinorum, presbytes, poliocephalus , and makirensis as allospecies, 

 but a thorough revision may raise several additional subspecies, on 

 islands around New Guinea, to the rank of allospecies. — E. M. 



P. trivirgatus, olivaceus, and cebuensis are closely related but are 

 sympatric on Negros Island, Philippines. It may eventually be found 

 that some allopatric subspecies now in the highly variable trivirgatus 

 species actually are more closely related to olivaceus and cebuensis 

 (cf. Parkes, 1971, pp. 32-34).— G. E. W.

 Regulus modestus, a synonym of Phylloscopus." All the other species 

 names in Hodgson's list are now determinable, but were nomina nuda 

 in 1844, and were only made available by J. E. and G. R. Gray, 1846, 

 Cat. Specimens Drawings Mammalia Birds Nepal Thibet, pp. 151—

 Brit. Mus., p. 35, designated Abrornis erochroa (- Phylloscopus 

 pulcher) the type of Abrornis, and Oates, 1889, Fauna Brit. India, 

 Aves, 1, p. 429, designated Abrornis schisticeps Hodgson as type of 

 Abrornis, Regulus modestus, which was the only species name valid 

 in 1844, must be the type, and Abrornis is therefore a synonym of 

 Phylloscopus. Some authors include Tickellia hodgsoni in the same 

 genus with these bamboo warblers, in which case Tickellia takes 

 precedence as the oldest generic name. — G. E. W.

 quate to separate Volga and Siberian birds from European commu- 

 nis. The Stresemanns also had difficulty in identifying volgensis (1968, 

 pp. 303-314). They demonstrated that European (communis) and 

 Asiatic (icterops) birds differ in molt and winter quarters. European 

 birds have a complete molt on the breeding grounds in July and Au- 

 gust before migration and a partial, mainly body molt in Africa. Asiatic 

 birds undergo their complete molt in Africa in January-March and 

 have a partial body molt in July. European birds winter north of 

 Asiatic birds but their winter ranges overlap in Ethiopia, Kenya, and 

 Uganda.— G. E. W.

 throats conspecific, rather than follow Vaurie, 1954, pp. 9-11, and 

 1959, Birds Pal. Fauna, Passeriformes, pp. 259-263, who separates 

 three species: curruca with blythi, telengitica, halimodendri, and sni- 

 girewskii as subspecies, minula with margelanica, and althaea with 

 monticola and zagrossiensis. Vaurie states that the three species breed 

 sympatrically in Iran and possibly also in Transcaspia, but William- 

 son suggests that an area of intergradation occurs in southern Tur- 

 key (curruca and althaea, possibly also in the Caucasus, caucasica, 

 and southern Caspian district of Iran) and specimens intermediate 

 between caucasica and minula have been collected on passage in Iraq, 

 Iran, and Arabia. Lesser Whitethroats in the areas of purported hy- 

 bridization or sympatry in Turkey, Iran, and Turkistan should be 

 studied in the field and their voices recorded. I have examined the 

 superb series of central Asian and western Chinese specimens in 

 Leningrad and am convinced that this is a highly plastic species that 

 responds morphologically to local environmental conditions. Brown- 

 ish birds of moderate size occur in the taiga and forest zones of Eu- 

 rope and Siberia (curruca), large, dark-grayish birds in mountains 

 (caucasica, althaea, monticola), paler birds of moderate size in the 

 forest steppe (telengitica, halimodendri), and pale birds, either very 

 small or large, in the deserts (jaxartica, minula, margelanica, chuan- 

 cheica).—G. E. W.

Various authors have treated S. melanocephala, melanothorax, and 

 mystacea, or cantillans and mystacea, or rueppelli and melanothorax 

 as conspecific. I believe, however, that all five are best considered 

 full species that are closely related. S. melanocephala overlaps ruep- 

 pelli in southern Greece, the southern Aegean, and southern Turkey, 

 and overlaps mystacea in Israel. S. cantillans and mystacea are al- 

 lopatric but differ in wing-tail proportions and in tarsal scutellation. 

 They are certainly not conspecific, contra Portenko, 1960, Ptitsy SSSR, 

 pt. 4, pp. 94-95; cf. Kazakov, 1973, Vestnik Zool., no. 2, pp. 66-69.—

 land (terricolor) and lowland (poonensis) forms in India and one res- 

 ident (siamensis) and two migratory (latirostris, cinereoalba) forms 

 in Thailand, most authors have treated the continental populations 

 of the species as monotypic. Color variations may be due to seasonal 

 wear. I can see no reasons under the current International Code of 

 Zoological Nomenclature for accepting Hartert's (1934, Vogel Pal. 

 Fauna, Erganzungsband, p. 230) rejection of Pallas' name in favor 

 of latirostris Raffles for this species because it was proposed as a 

 variety. Pallas' name has been in wide use in the Russian litera-

 Southern Shensi (Ch'in Ling Mountains), western Szechwan 

 (O-mei Shan, Pao-hsing), northwestern Yunnan (Te-ch'in), 

 southeastern Tibet, western Hupeh, and northwestern Fu- 

 kien. Probably migrates to southern Yunnan, southeastern 

 Thailand, northern Laos, and Vietnam in winter. Breeding 

 records for southern Yunnan and Hainan may pertain to mi- 

 grants or to N. sundara denotata. 



^he status and range of this species are tentative. There has been 

 much confusion in the literature between N. davidi and N. sundara. 

 Both N. sundara denotata and N. davidi may breed in Szechwan and 

 in the Ch'in Ling Mountains in southern Shensi and thus are distinct 

 species. The slight color differences are more suggestive of subspe- 

 cies, however, and the large size of davidi continues a west to east 

 cline from sundara to denotata. For a discussion of the characters 

 and range of davidi and sundara, see Dickinson, 1973, Nat. Hist. 

 Bull. Siam Soc, 24, pp. 409-430. More recently Cheng reports (in 

 litt.) that both species have been collected in Shensi. — G. E. W.

x The type of chersonesites is aberrant. It has more dark blue on the 

 sides of the throat than usual in sumatrensis and the breast is nearly 

 chestnut so that it superficially resembles N. rubeculoides glauci- 

 comans from below. However, its paler dorsal color, short wing, rel- 

 ative lengths of the outer two primaries, and long tarsus, show that 

 it belongs with sumatrensis. — G. E. W. 



2 Where N. r. rufigastra and N. tickelliae sumatrensis overlap in 

 the Malay Peninsula and presumably in eastern Sumatra, rufigastra 

 is a mangrove and coastal lowland bird, whereas sumatrensis fre- 

 quents jungle and scrub-clad hills. — G. E. W.

x The four largely allopatric "species" cyaneus, melanotus, cal- 

 lainus, and splendens are sometimes considered subspecies of a sin- 

 gle species (cyaneus), sometimes four separate species or allospecies. 

 However, the ranges of cyaneus and melanotus are said to overlap 

 along the Murray River and the same is suspected for melanotus and 

 callainus in the Flinders Range. In view of the rather striking dif- 

 ferences in color and habitat utilization, it would seem best, for the 

 time being, to treat them as allospecies in a superspecies (cyaneus), 

 except for callainus, which interbreeds with splendens where they 

 meet— E. M.

Malurus lamberti dulcis Mathews 

 Malurus dulcis Mathews, 1908, Bull. Brit. Ornith. Club, 21, 



^he four "species" lamberti, amabilis, pulcherrimus, and elegans 

 are sometimes treated as subspecies of a single species, lamberti. They 

 are very similar and essentially allopatric, though the breeding ranges 

 of lamberti and pulcherrimus and of pulcherrimus and elegans over- 

 lap (interbreeding not determined). It is therefore necessary to treat 

 these four forms as allospecies of a superspecies, lamberti. See also

J The lost unique specimen of Eutrichomyias rowleyi (Meyer) dif-

 bill, longer nasal bristles, and much longer tarsus. Presumably the 

 species is a well differentiated geographic representative of Terpsi- 

 phone.— G. E. W. 



2 The treatment of African species is based on Meise's careful re- 

 view (1968, Zool. Beitr., N. F., 14, pp. 1-44), except for the treatment 

 of bedfordi, where Prigogine, 1976, 1980 (see references) is followed. 

 The three African species all hybridize in some parts of their ranges, 

 and three stable races are actually of hybrid origin. However, all 

 three species occur together in the lower Guinea forest without in- 

 terbreeding and are best considered distinct. — M. A. T., Jr.
