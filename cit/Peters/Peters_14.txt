INTRODUCTION 



The eight taxa covered in this volume (Parulidae, Drepan- 

 ididae, Vireonidae, Icteridae, Fringillidae, CardueHnae, Es- 

 trildidae, and Viduinae) contain only about six percent of 

 the living species of birds, but these are among the best 

 known of the entire class. For many of these species there 

 is comparatively abundant information on their natural his- 

 tory, general biology, physiology, ethology, and even genet- 

 ics. A comparable amount of data could not be found for any 

 similar assemblage of birds. However, in spite of the abun- 

 dance of taxonomically useful information, or more probably 

 because of it, the systematics of these birds are among the 

 most unsettled and controversial in the Class Aves. 



One would hope that each volume of the Check-list would 

 have a useful life span of at least a few decades. But, even 

 though the authors have adopted a conservative approach 

 and avoided recent radical innovations. Volume XIV, cover- 

 ing birds of interest to so many biologists, ranging from 

 physiologists to ethologists, will certainly show its age ear- 

 lier than other volumes in the series. If this volume is a 

 touchstone from which rapid advances and changes are 

 made, then it will have served an important function. 



Once again the editor is grateful for the cooperation of 

 the authors and to those who read manuscripts and offered 

 suggestions. I have been fortunate in having the editorial 

 assistance of Mrs. Nanette W. Plotkin; the short interval 

 between this volume and the last to be published (Vol. XII, 

 1967) is largely due to her efforts. Mrs. Michael D. McBride 

 has continued to contribute her time and skill in preparing 

 the index. 



Manuscript for this volume was completed 1 July 1968. 

 Only minor modifications were made after this date.

1 Of the genera previously (e.g., Hellmayr, 1935, Field Mus. Nat.

 Coerebidae," Coereba and Conirostruvi (including Ateleodacnis) are, 

 provisionally, here appended to the Parulidae. The other genera 

 (Diglossa, Chlorophanes, Iridophanes, Cyanerpes, Dacnis, Hemidacnis, 

 Xenodacnis, Oreomanes, and Euneomis) have been transferred to the 

 Thraupinae, Further studies (e.g., Skutch, 1962, Condor, 64, pp. 113- 

 116) have indicated the possibility that Coereba is so distinct that it 

 might be best treated as a monotypic family, and that Conirostrum 

 may be related to the Emberizine finches. Consequently, we have placed 

 both these genera among the genera incertae sedis at the end of the 

 family. — G. H. L., Jr. and B. L. M., Jr.

 Southeastern Manitoba, northern Michigan, southern 



Ontario, central New York, eastern Massachusetts, and 



Vermivora, Panda, and Dendroica. Nevertheless, since they can be 

 defined, after a fashion, by morphological criteria such as bill shape, 

 rictal bristles, and cranial characters, as well as by ethological 

 criteria, and since each genus seems to comprise a group of species 

 more closely related to each other than to species in the other genera, 

 we have not followed the suggestion by Griscom (1957, in Griscom 

 and Sprunt (editors), Warblers Amer., p. 349) that the three genera 

 be combined into a single genus, Vermivora. Moreover, combining the 

 three genera would necessitate many nomenclatural changes, including 

 the erection of three new names, four name changes at the species 

 level, and the suppression of the type genus of the family, Parula, as a 

 junior synonym of Vermivora. In view of the foregoing, we prefer to 

 preserve nomenclatural stability by retaining the three genera until a 

 more thorough investigation has been made of their ethology and 

 internal morphology. — G. H. L., Jr. and B. L. M., Jr.

1 B. fraseri Berlepsch and Taczanowski, 1884, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lon- 

 don, 51(1883), p. 541 — Chimbo and Guayaquil, Ecuador, is a nomen 

 nudum. — G. H. L., Jr. and B. L. M., Jr. 



~ The original description gives the type locality as "Yungas, 

 Chiquitos, Bolivia." The use of "Yungas" has created confusion (e.g., 

 Hellmayr, 1935, Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Publ., Zool. Ser., 13, pt. 8, 

 p. 487) because Chiquitos is not in the familiar Yungas of La Paz. 

 The term "yungas" is also applied to slopes elsewhere; it seems logical 

 to conclude that the type locality is on the slopes of the range outside 

 of San Jose de Chiquitos, Province of Chiquitos, Department of Santa 

 Cruz. — Ed.

 However, montana seems to have thraupine affinities while palustris 

 appears to be close to the parulid genus Geothlypis. We therefore raise 

 Xenoligea to full generic rank and place it with several other tanager-

1 North American birds (olivaceus), the Central American flavo-

 distinct species and often are so treated. All are closely related and, 

 with V. altiloquus, clearly form a superspecies. — E. R. B. 



2 The author describes the race as being "different" but does not 

 specify the difference. The name is probably a nomen nudum al- 

 though it could be argued that reference to the eggs being larger 

 satisfies the requirement of an "indication" according to the Intern. 

 Code Zool. NomencL, 1961, Art. 17(4) ; a bird egg is doubtless a "stage 

 in life history." — E. R. B.

 coastal, the name pustulatus would have to be shifted to the taxon 

 now known as formosus. Because Stresemann does not state how or by 

 whom the lectotype was selected, also because of the profusion of 

 villages bearing the name San Mateo and the possibility that the 

 provenance of the lectotype was not coastal, it seems best to retain the 

 present nomenclature. — E. R. B.

1 This name is not preoccupied by F. canariensis Boddaert, 1783, 

 p. 12, because that name, not designated as mihi, is ascribed to Brisson 

 and Linnaeus both of whom use the spellings canarius (Serinus) or 

 canaria. Obviously it is another one of Boddaert's countless inaccura- 

 cies rather than a deliberate emendation. Boddaert's name must, 

 therefore, be considered an "incorrect subsequent spelling" without 

 status in nomenclature. But even if one were to accept Boddaert's name 

 as an available emendation, it was at no time a senior homonym of 

 Vieillot's name, since it had been transferred already in 1816 to the 

 genus Serinus Koch. — E. M.

2 The limits of the genera and relationships among the species are 

 less understood — and subject to more controversy — in the cardue- 

 lines than in any other group of passerines, with the possible exception 

 of the estrildines. The arrangement of the genera, and that of the 

 Eurasian species, has been mainly my responsibility. This arrangement 

 was arrived at with the assistance of those who read the manuscript 

 and with the particularly generous help of Michel Desfayes and John 

 P. Hubbard, who provided copies of their unpublished studies of this 

 vexing group. It is doubtful that the resulting arrangement will be 

 fully satisfactory to anyone, for even I am not satisfied. However, 

 with the available information this seems the best that can be done.

1 The generic affinities of this species are uncertain, although its 

 placement in Serinus, in spite of the geographic isolation of the taxon 

 from other members of the genus, seems less likely to be wrong than 

 positioning it within Carduelis and next to C. spinoides monguilloti, as 

 proposed by Delacour, 1946, Zoologica [New York], 31, p. 4 {vide 

 Eipley and Eabor, 1961, Postilla, Yale Univ., no. 50, pp. 13-17). I do 

 not believe, however, that Wolter's proposal (1967, Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 

 18, pp. 169-172) to create a separate genus (Chrysocorythus) for the 

 species aids in the solution of the problem. — R. A. P., Jr. 



2 Placed as a ploceid next to Amblyospiza by Moreau, 1962, in 

 Check-list, 15, p. 32, but it is probably related to the African car- 

 duelines (see Amadon, 1965, Ibis, pp. 395-396). — A. L. R.

 Grant, preoccupied (if Rhynchostruthus and Pseuda-

1 The relative position of this monotypic genus within the subfamily 

 is uncertain. The species seems somewhat reminiscent of the green- 

 finches except for its enormous bill. Ripley and Bond, 1966, Smiths. 

 Misc. Coll., 151, no. 7, p. 33, note that its skull bears a strong resem- 

 blance to that of Pinicola and the New World Evening Grosbeaks 

 ("Hesperiphona") . They do not say whether this similarity is due to 

 a genuine relationship or is the result of structural convergence to 

 accommodate a large bill. I would suspect the latter to be the case. One 

 wonders if this is not a greenfinch that has evolved a large bill to cope 

 with the thick coverings of desert seeds. Until the species has been 

 studied I prefer to keep it in a monotypic genus placed near Carduelis.

ing case can be made for keeping them separate and even allowing 

 genera such as Spinus and Chloris to stand apart (vide, e.g., Acker- 

 mann, 1967, Journ. f. Ornith., 108, pp. 430-473, vs. Nicolai, 1960, Zool. 

 Jahrb., Abt. Syst., 87, pp. 317-362). If one believes that the differences 

 separating Acantlds from Carduells are not sufficient for generic dis- 

 tinction, then the way is set for including Serinus, Linu7-gus, and, 

 perhaps, even Carpodacus within Carduelis. I must admit to being un- 

 decided on the limits of Carduelis. For that reason I prefer to preserve 

 the status quo and simply follow Vaurie, 1959, Birds Pal. Fauna, 

 Passeriformes, pp. 597-620, and keep Acanthis a full genus, although 

 not to the extent of separating it from Carduelis by Callacanthis. —

 Without knowledge of his evidence, and with no familiarity with any 

 of the living birds, I prefer to follow Vaurie, 1949, loc. cit., in not 

 recognizing Rhodospiza, but, on the other hand, think that Rhodo- 

 pechys and Callacanthis should at least be placed next to one another, 

 rather than separated by Acanthis and Leucosticte, as was done by 

 Vaurie, 1959, Birds Pal. Fauna, Passeriformes. — R. A. P., Jr.

1 Urocynchramus is traditionally placed next to Uragus (e.g. 

 Sharpe, 1909, Hand-List, and Vaurie, 1959, Birds Pal. Fauna, Passeri- 

 formes), but except for its long tail it possesses no other character 

 which would place it closer to Uragus than to any other rosefinch. 

 In fact, the presence of a well-developed tenth primary distinguishes 

 it from all other Carduelines and the presence of a bright color 

 (scarlet) in the tail sets it apart from the rosefinches, which in body 

 color and pattern it resembles. I am, however, unable to suggest a 

 more appropriate placement for this odd bird and retain it next to 

 Uragus as a convenience. — R. A. P., Jr.

1 The five races recognized are differentiated only by color and 

 amount of streaking, characters best seen in breeding birds in adult 

 plumage. Identification of breeding birds is complicated by the fact 

 that some males of perhaps all races breed while still in "female 

 plumage," which may not be identical with that of the adult female. 

 Migrating and wintering birds often cannot be identified to race. —

 roborowskii from all other rose finches, are doubtless specializations

 presumably, allow the species to utilize an environmental niche occu- 

 pied by no other rose finch. Counterparts in color and pattern are 

 found in several species of Carpodacus, however, and separation of

 49, pp. 415-441 and 1954, op. cit, 75B, pp. 489-498). Because of the 

 pronounced overlap among Chapin's subspecies, Mackworth-Praed and 

 Grant (1947, Ibis, 89, pp. 268-272) elevate all races to the rank of 

 species, but this ignores the numerous intermediate specimens that 

 could only be identified by purely arbitrary criteria. Lumping all the 

 races is unsatisfactory since it obscures the partial but definite geo- 

 graphic segregation of the three races. In this species we have learned 

 as much as museum specimens can tell us, and further advances will 

 depend on intensive field work, — M. A. T.

1 The two widespread species of the subgenus Hypochera, viz. 

 chalybeata and funerea, have been shown to intergrade extensively 

 in several areas (Traylor, 1966). However, over most of the regions 

 in which they are sympatric they behave as good species, and this 

 should be recognized. The subspecies codringtoni is placed in brackets 

 because its range is wholly within that of amaurojjteryx with which 

 it intergrades; however, typical specimens of each are strikingly 

 different in size and color. — M. A. T. 



2 Fringilla melanictera Gmelin, 1789, Syst. Nat. 1(2), p. 910, the 

 Melophus melanicterus of Sharpe, 1909, Hand-list, 5, p. 286, may 

 belong to the subgenus Hypochera. However, it is unidentifiable to 

 species. See Ticehurst, 1932, Bull. Brit. Ornith. Club, 53, p. 15.—
