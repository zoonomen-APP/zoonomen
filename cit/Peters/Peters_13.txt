INTRODUCTION 



It has been the custom for the editor alone to write the 

 Introduction to volumes in this series published since the 

 death of J. L. Peters. However, because the present volume 

 has but one author in addition to the editor-author and 

 because of the controversial nature of the systematic ar- 

 rangement of the taxa treated herein, the authors have 

 collaborated more closely than usual. It is appropriate, 

 therefore, that this Introduction be written jointly in order 

 to point out some of the problems that were encountered 

 and the reasons why they were handled as they were. 



The systematic allocation and arrangement of the Oscines 

 are among the most complex problems encountered by the 

 taxonomist. A flurry of interest in the subject in the 1950's 

 (e.g., Beecher, 1953, Auk, 70, pp. 270-333; Tordoff, 1954, 

 Misc. Publ. Mus. Zool. Univ. Michigan, no. 81, 42 pp.; 

 Delacour and Vaurie, 1957, Contrib. Sci., Los Angeles 

 County Mus., no. 16, 6 pp. ; Amadon, 1957, Proc. Zool. Soc. 

 Calcutta, 259-268, pp. 259-268 ; Bock, 1960, Bull. Mus. Comp. 

 Zool., 122, pp. 361-488) resulted in some solutions but 

 mainly served to define more clearly the problems. In the 

 last decade little work has been done on the relationships 

 within and between the higher categories of the Oscines 

 and there continues to be considerable disagreement among 

 taxonomists as to the family or subfamily allocation of 

 many species, and in particular those taxa treated in this 

 volume. 



Traditionally, as for example in Ridgway (1901 and 1902, 

 Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus., 50, pts. 1 and 2), Hartert (1903-04, 

 Vogel pal. Fauna), Hellmayr (1935, 1936, and 1938, Field 

 Mus. Nat. Hist. Publ., Zool. Ser., 13, pts. 8, 9, and 11), and 

 the A.O.U. Check-list of North American Birds, edition 5 

 (1957), the cardinal-grosbeaks, emberizine buntings, 

 carduelines, and similar "sparrows" and "finches" are 

 lumped within the very large family Fringillidae, while the 

 tanagers, Swallow-tanager, Plush-capped Finch, and "coe- 

 rebids" are each afforded familial rank. 



The arrangement followed herein is the so-called "Basel 

 sequence" (Mayr and Greenway, 1956, Breviora, Mus. 

 Comp. Zool. Harvard, no. 58, 11 pp.). It differs from the 

 "traditional" arrangement in that the carduelines and the 




VI INTRODUCTION 



Brambling and Chaffinches (Fringilla) are treated as the 

 family Fringillidae, while the emberizine buntings, cardinal- 

 grosbeaks, Plush-capped Finch, tanagers, and Swallow- 

 tanager 1 are demoted to subfamilial status and united under 

 the family Emberizidae, and separated from the carduelines 

 and Fringilla by the wood warblers, Hawaiian honey- 

 creepers, vireos, and icterids (see Check-list, Vol. 14). In 

 other words, the "Fringillidae" of, for example, Ridgway 

 or Hellmayr, is enormously more broad than the "Fringilli- 

 dae" of the Basel sequence. 



The Basel sequence has the merit of bringing together 

 an array of presumably related groups (treated as sub- 

 families) under a single family heading, which emphasizes 

 the fact that there is a good deal of uncertainty as to where 

 one draws the line between, say, tanagers and buntings, or, 

 indeed, if an effort to maintain them as separate groups is 

 desirable. It must be frankly admitted that within the 

 Oscines there are few families (or subfamilies) which 

 can be unequivocally differentiated from all other families 

 (or subfamilies) on the basis of morphology, behavior, or 

 any other taxonomic characters. 



Nevertheless, although aware that we are forcing into a 

 linear sequence several radiating groups, which may or may 

 not be related, we have maintained, and tried to improve, 

 the traditional groupings, even though we are no more 

 successful than others in characterizing these groups. 



Earlier workers often relied heavily on bill form as a 

 taxonomic character. We, believing that bill form is of less 

 value as a taxonomic character, have emphasized plumage 

 color, pattern, and texture, as well as anatomical, behavioral, 

 and distributional data, if they are available. The result is, 

 admittedly, often tentative and far from satisfactory, as 

 evidenced by our liberal use of explanatory footnotes. There 

 is ample opportunity for dissent but we think this is in itself 

 valuable and hope that there may be sparked a renewed in- 

 terest in the classification of the Oscines. 



1 The "Subfamily Coerebinae" was also included in the Emberi- 

 zidae in the Basel sequence but has been dismembered in this Check- 

 list; its genera are distributed between the Parulidae and the 

 Thraupinae (see Vol. 14, p. 3, 1968 for details). 




INTRODUCTION Vll 



The Emberizinae have been arranged in seven groupings, 

 proceeding from the "typical" emberizines to a group of 

 genera whose affinities are in doubt. These groupings are 

 more for the sake of convenience rather than an indication 

 of a presumed evolutionary sequence, although within each 

 group (except the last) closely related taxa are kept as 

 close to one another as a linear sequence will allow. 



Genera of the first group, from Melophus to Oriturus, are 

 "typical" emberizines, i.e., generally grassland forms, prin- 

 cipally Holarctic, with plain or streaked plumage, and no 

 exposed bright colors. 



The second group of genera, from Phrygilus through 

 Poospiza, contains Neotropical forms which are inhabitants 

 of grassland and in some cases brush. They range from 

 dull-plumaged forms to some with bright colors and striking 

 patterns. They are presumed, mainly on zoogeographic ev- 

 idence, to be interrelated, but it would not be surprising if 

 some taxa are misplaced here. 



The third group, Sicalis, Emberizoides and Embernagra, 

 comprises Middle and South American genera, thought to 

 have originated in South America. They inhabit grasslands 

 and are typically streaked, with some (Sicalis) brightly 

 colored. 



The fourth group, Volatinia to Melanospiza, is composed 

 of small, thick-billed, seed-eating, open country ground- 

 feeders found in the West Indies and from southern Texas 

 through South America. There is little doubt that it is an 

 artificial assemblage, of diverse ancestry (see footnote, 

 p. 132). 



Genera of the fifth group, Darwin's Finches (Geospiza 

 through Pinaroloxias) , are of undoubted common ancestry. 

 They are presumably an offshoot of some form within group 

 four, the thick-billed ground-feeders. 



Group six, Pipilo to TJrothraupis, is a closely related as- 

 semblage of brightly colored, or strongly patterned, soft- 

 plumaged brush and forest inhabiting genera. They range 

 from Canada to South America, exhibiting particular di- 

 versity in the Neotropical mountains. 



The seventh group, Charitospiza through Paroaria, com- 




Vlll INTRODUCTION 



prises genera incertae sedis. Some perhaps belong with the 

 Thraupinae. 



The Cardinalinae do not offer the complexities found 

 within the Emberizinae. Spiza, whose affinities may be with 

 the Emberizinae rather than with the Cardinalinae, starts 

 the subfamily. The remaining genera are arranged to re- 

 flect an increasing tendency away from the Emberizinae 

 and toward the Thraupinae. 



The adoption of the Basel sequence by the former editors 

 of the Check-list necessitated a reversal of the usual se- 

 quence of genera in the tanagers in order that the most finch- 

 like genera could be placed nearest the finches. The 

 Thraupinae are arranged in seven groups of genera. 



The first group, Orchesticus through Sericossypha, con- 

 sists of genera incertae sedis which resemble finches and 

 may actually belong in the Emberizinae or Cardinalinae. 

 They are not a natural group. 



The second group, Nesospingus through Nemosia, con- 

 tains some finch-like genera of small birds centered around 

 Chlorospingus and Hemispingus. Bill form in this group 

 varies from finch-like to warbler-like, but with few excep- 

 tions, the plumage is soft in texture and ranges in color 

 from yellow and olive to gray, rufous, brown, and black. 

 In texture, color, and pattern, the plumage of these birds 

 closely resembles that of Atlapetes and related genera in 

 the Emberizinae and of Basileuterus in the Parulidae. 



The third group, Phaenicophilus through Orthogonys, 

 contains a miscellany of medium-sized, thin-billed species. 

 On zoogeographic grounds, Phaenicophilus and Calypto- 

 philns are probably related, and they may also be related 

 to the parulid genera Microligea and Xenoligea. The last 

 three genera appear related on the basis of plumage charac- 

 ters. Rhodinocichla resembles Mitrospingus in some of these 

 characters, but in color and sexual dimorphism is more like 

 Granatellus, currently considered a parulid. 



The fourth group, Eucometis through Ramphocelus, 

 shows a progression from insectivorous or carnivorous types 

 to specialized fruit-eaters and a parallel trend from species 

 which are predominantly yellow and olive or black to species 




INTRODUCTION IX 



in which at least the males are red or partly red. Sexual 

 dimorphism is the rule rather than the exception in this and 

 the following groups. 



The fifth group, Spindalis through Pipraeidea, consists 

 almost entirely of "generalized" tanagers which are blue or 

 bluish (or green) and yellow, orange, or buff. Blue is lack- 

 ing in Spindalis. However, that genus appears close to 

 Thraupis (especially T. bonariensis) on the basis of other 

 plumage characters, as well as morphology. 



The sixth group, Euphonia through Cyanerpes, contains 

 birds whose feeding habits range from an almost exclusive 

 diet of mistletoe berries (Euphonia) through more gen- 

 eralized diets of fruit and insects to nectar feeding 

 {Cyanerpes) . Whereas the extremes are very different, they 

 are linked by a series of forms which are variously inter- 

 mediate in bill form and plumage characters. Tangara ap- 

 pears near the base of this group, with one line leading 

 from it through Chlorophonia to Euphonia and another 

 leading from Tangara vassorii through Dacnis to Cyanerpes. 



The seventh group, Xenodacnis through Euneornis, is 

 another group of genera incertae sedis. All may be derived 

 from finches rather than tanagers or parulids. Oreomanes 

 may be close to Diglossa or to Conirostrum or both. The 

 other two appear independently derived from each other 

 and from Diglossa. Because of the uncertainty of their re- 

 lationships, they have been kept near the tanager honey- 

 creepers (Cyanerpes, et al.) where Beecher (1951, Wilson 

 Bull., 63, pp. 274-287) placed them on morphological 

 grounds. 



Tersina is placed at the end because it seems closest to 

 Tangara. 



The editor is, once again, grateful to that small group of 

 ornithologists who so willingly read manuscripts and offered 

 assistance and advice. 



The competent editorial assistance of Mrs. Nanette W. 

 Plotkin, Robert Bennett, and Mrs. Darlene K. Dyer is ac- 

 knowledged. Mrs. Michael D. McBride has again contributed 

 her skill and time in preparing the index. 




X INTRODUCTION 



Partial support for research on the Emberizinae and 

 Cardinalinae was received from the National Science Foun- 

 dation under Grant GB-4210. 



Manuscript for this volume was completed 1 April 1970. 

 A few minor changes were made subsequent to that date.

1 Melophus does not seem closely related to Emberiza although on 

 zoogeographic considerations it is presumably closer to Emberiza than 

 to any other genus. — R.A.P., Jr. 



2 The affinities of L. siemsseni with other members of the Ember- 

 izinae are uncertain. L. siemsseni is sometimes placed within Em- 

 beriza, but in pattern it bears little resemblance to members of this 

 large genus. Any near relationship with the species of Junco, in 

 which genus it was first put, appears even less likely. 



It seems, therefore, best to emphasize the doubtful affinities of this 

 bird and to retain it in the monotypic genus Latoucheornis. — R.A.P., 

 Jr.

For the sake of stability in an area where opinion is not often 

 based on incontestable fact, the sequence of Palearctic species is that 

 employed by Vaurie. Footnotes indicate where I believe the sequence 

 could be improved. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 The African species E. poliopleura, flaviventris, affinis, and 

 cabanisi, a closely related group, bear strong resemblances to palearc- 

 tic E. aureola. These resemblances may be only accidental, but it is 

 noteworthy that aureola has a wide breeding range, that the western 

 breeding population winters to the southeast rather than directly 

 south, and that the species is a wide-ranging straggler. These at- 

 tributes suggest that aureola from the western palearctic may have 

 populated eastern Africa, become non-migratory and isolated, and 

 differentiated into the present-day Africa group. — R.A.P., Jr.

2 E. koslowi seems out of place between E. rutila and E. melanoce- 

 phala. The chestnut of the upper back is similar to these species and 

 the black head is like that of E. melanocephala, but the resemblance 

 ends here. The gray and white underparts, black breast band, and 

 white outer rectrices are very distinctive. Placement near E. leucoce- 

 phala, as was done by Sharpe, 1909, Hand-list, 5, p. 283, appears more 

 logical, from both morphological and geographical evidence. — R.A.P.,

 that of some others (e.g. E. s. passerina) , is suspect; it may result 

 from difficulty in differentiating the various races in winter plumage.

 willing to apply a concept of very broad genera throughout the Em- 

 berizinae. If the two relatively discrete taxa Junco and Zonotrichia 

 are combined, then, for consistency in treatment, such similar genera 

 as Pipilo, Arremon, Arremonops, and Atlapetes, and Emberiza and 

 Calcarius, and a host of others must also be merged. Too many Em- 

 berizine genera are poorly known to begin such wholesale amalga- 

 mation. — ■ R.A.P., Jr.

 described the population breeding "east of the Rocky Mountains." 

 Furthermore, Miller selected as a lectotype a winter specimen from 

 west of the Rocky Mountains in the belief that Dwight did not make 

 "use of any particular breeding specimens in formulating his concept 

 of cismontanus." Phillips rejected this restricted type locality because

it does not fall within the breeding range given by Dwight. While one 

 might prefer that a breeding specimen from east of the Rocky Moun-

 nowhere states that lectotype must be chosen from within the range 

 given in the original description (contra Phillips). — R.A.P., Jr. 



1 Phillips, loc. cit., believed the type of shufeldti to be a representa- 

 tive of the interior population, which would become a synonym of 

 montanus Ridgway, 1898, leaving the coastal form without a name. 

 His arguments seem less convincing than those presented by Miller, 

 op. cit., pp. 393-395, who considered the type to be an example of the 

 more western population. — R.A.P., Jr.

 Amphispiza have notably soft-textured plumages, unlike that of any 

 species currently placed in Aimophila. Furthermore, because Aimo- 

 phila may not be a natural assemblage, it would appear prudent to 

 maintain the status quo until Aimophila has been more thoroughly 

 studied. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 Phrygilus malvinarum Brooks, described from a single specimen 

 from West Falkland Island, was thought by Hellmayr, 1938, Field Mus. 

 Nat. Hist. Publ., Zool. Ser., 13, pt. 11, p. 365-366, to be an immature 

 of M. melanodera. The absence of any yellow, even on the tail, and the 

 large bill lead me to believe the bird is an immature of M. xantho- 

 gramma. 



Hybridism between M. melanodera and M. xanthogramma has been 

 suggested (e.g. Bennett, 1926, Ibis, p. 332). This phenomenon could 

 account for some of the plumage and distributional puzzles encoun- 

 tered in these species, but more specmiens and field observations may 

 show the answers are simpler. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 R. goughensis, although considerably larger, is strikingly sim- 

 ilar to Donacospiza albifrons in color, pattern, and acuminate tail 

 feathers. The two species of Nesospiza, although smaller, also bear a 

 strong resemblance to Donacospiza albifrons. A relationship between 

 Rowettia, Nesospiza, and Donacospiza seems at least as plausible as 

 any of the relationships suggested before (see summary in Rand, 1955, 

 Fieldiana: Zool. [Chicago], 37, pp. 147-150). I am uncertain as to how, 

 or if, these three genera fit in with Melanodera, which has been sug- 

 gested as a likely ancestor for Rowettia and possibly also for Neso- 

 spiza. The three genera are placed near Melanodera in this sequence 

 merely because I believe they all may have been derived from a single 

 South American emberizine ancestor and Melanodera is a sufficiently 

 unspecialized genus to have served as the stem stock. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 Incaspiza bears a strong resemblance to the geographically dis- 

 tant red-backed forms of Junco and may belong near that genus. On 

 the other hand, Incaspiza forms somewhat of a transition between the 

 Phrygilus-like genera Diuca, Idiopsar, Piezorhina, and Xenospiza and 

 the fairly distinctive genus Poospiza. 



The relationships of the taxa of Incaspiza are poorly known: 

 pulchra and personata may be full species; J. ortizi, here treated as 

 monotypic, may be conspecific with pulchra and personata, or with one 

 or the other. — R.A.P., Jr.

2 This could well represent three species (vide, e.g., de Schauensee, 

 1966, Species Birds South Amer., p. 516), viz. the chrysops, mexicana, 

 eisenmanni, and bogotensis group; the luteola, flavissima, and chap- 

 mani group; and, finally, luteoventris. This complex is poorly known 

 and it is possible that field study is the only way the relationships can 

 be deciphered. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 The genera Volatinia through Melanospiza, which are usually 

 placed next to one another, seem to be a convergent assemblage that 

 may be broadly described as thick-billed, seed-eating ground birds. 

 The diversity of ancestry is so great that some genera may even be- 

 long with the subfamily Cardinalinae. However, the phylogenetic 

 relationships are obscure and I am unable to suggest a distribution of 

 the genera within the Emberizinae (or Cardinalinae) which would 

 have any more evolutionary meaning than the "traditional" group-

1 This genus is very similar to Arremon and distinguished only by 

 slight, but distinct, differences in color pattern. The two genera might 

 be merged, as was done by Phelps and Phelps, Jr., 1950, Bol. Soc. 

 Venezolana Cienc. Nat., 12(75), p. 370, and de Schauensee, 1951, 

 Caldasia (Inst. Cienc. Nat. U. Nac. Colombia), 5(25), p. 1108 (but 

 not by de Schauensee, 1966, Birds South Amer., pp. 524-526). How- 

 ever, if these slight color differences are not considered to be of generic 

 value, one is forced to question the significance of minor differences in 

 wing-tail proportions which are now used to separate generically some 

 similarly patterned forms of Atlapetes and Arremon. From here one 

 is led to question the validity of maintaining Pezopetes, Oreotkraupis, 

 and Pselliophorus as distinct from Atlapetes, and thence on to ques- 

 tioning the generic rank of Pipilo and a host of other genera in the 

 Emberizinae. There is little doubt that the Emberizinae are oversplit 

 generically, but wholesale merging must be deferred until the Central 

 and South American forms are better known as living birds, rather 

 than almost exclusively as museum specimens. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 I agree with Koepcke, 1957, Scientia, 4, pp. 41-42, that A. seebohmi

 suggested by de Schauensee, 1966, Birds South Amer., p. 522. — 

 R.A.P., Jr. 



2 Very similar to A. n. simonsi. The presence of another race so 

 near to simonsi, with no marked geographical features to provide 

 isolation, is suspect. The type may be an atypical specimen of simonsi. 

 In 1965 the type locality and surrounding area was searched for a 

 week, but A. nationi was not found. A. n. simonsi had been discovered 

 and studied beforehand at nearby Gonzanama (alt. 2,300 m.), pro- 

 viding information on habitat requirements and the behavior of the 

 species, which should have facilitated finding celicae. However, the 

 species is elusive and apparently very local ; it may yet be rediscovered 

 near Celica. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 A. leucopterus appears quite closely related to the A. schistaceus- 

 A. nationi complex. — R.A.P., Jr. 



2 "Eastern" was probably a lapsus for "western," although the 

 species might occasionally occur there (vide de Schauensee, 1966, 

 Species Birds South Amer., p. 522) . — R.A.P., Jr. 



3 It has been suggested by Hellmayr, 1938, Field Mus. Nat. Hist. 

 Publ., Zool. Ser., 13, pt. 11, p. 411, and by de Schauensee, 1966, Birds 

 South Amer., p. 522, that A. albiceps and A. pallidiceps may be con- 

 specific. However, I prefer to retain them as full species because the 

 taxa occur only a short distance from one another and they are 

 morphologically quite distinct. 



Both species, which are arid region forms, seem to have been 

 derived from the A. schistaceus-A. nationi complex, but are not so 

 close to it as is A. leucopterus. — R.A.P., Jr.

1 Hellmayr (loc. cit., p. 422) treated black-headed, thick-billed 

 A. t. atricapillus as a species (with tacarcunae as a race) because 

 its range was poorly known and it might prove to be sympatric with 

 black and gray-headed, slender-billed A. t. assimilis. The distribution 

 of the two forms remains obscure, but it seems that atricapillus is 

 restricted to a more northerly range and that intergradation between 

 the two forms may occur on the west slope of the Western Andes, 

 where neither taxon has yet been found. Furthermore, tacarunae 

 seems to exhibit intermediate characters and is very near costari- 

 censis, which Hellmayr placed in A. torquatus. There is the possi- 

 bility that there may exist a complex situation with two or more 

 sympatric species, but for the present it seems better to treat the 

 groups as conspecific. — R.A.P., Jr.

 Marshall, and Monson, 1964, Birds Arizona, p. 179 and C. H. Blake, 

 1969, Bird-banding, 40, p. 138. Cyanocompsa and Cyanoloxia seem 

 even more similar to Guiraca than Passerina and are, therefore, also 

 merged with Passerina. This is not an innovation; formally (e.g., 

 Sharpe, 1888, Cat. Birds Brit. Mus., 12, p. 66) Cyanocompsa and 

 Cyanoloxia were considered congeneric with Guiraca. 



Tordoff, 1954, Misc. Publ. Mus. Zool. Univ. Michigan, no. 81, p. 38, 

 treats the monotypic genus Porphyrospiza as an emberizine because 

 of the structure of its palato-maxillaries, a character of doubtful 

 taxonomic value, vide, e.g., Bock, 1960, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 122, 

 p. 480. Not only do I believe the genus should be restored to the 

 Cardinalinae, where it was placed by Hellmayr, 1938, Field Mus. Nat.

 South American Ultramarine Grosbeak, rather than to the Indigo

 filed with the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature 

 to invalidate Loxia cyanea and to fix the type locality of F ring ilia

2 Phlogothraupis is characterized by Ridgway (1902, Bull. U. S. 

 Nat. Mus. 50, pt. 2, p. 120) as differing from Ramphocelus in lacking 

 the backward extension of the mandibular sheath and in lacking sexual 

 dimorphism. In Ramphocelus, the extension of the mandible varies 

 greatly, being strongly developed in R. carbo and weakly in R. pas- 

 serinii (see Storer, 1969, Living Bird, 8, pp. 129-130). Sexual di- 

 morphism is strong in R. passerinii and very weak in R. nigrogularis. 

 "Phlogothraupis" sanguinolenta resembles the male of R. nigrogularis 

 in color pattern, differing primarily in the greater amount of black in 

 the underparts. The difference in the mandibles of "Phlogothraupis" 

 and R. passerinii is far less than that between R. passerinii and R. 

 carbo. From this, I conclude that Phlogothraupis should be merged 

 with Ramphocelus and that sanguinolentus should be placed next to 

 R. nigrogularis. — R.W.S.

 Richmond, who was expert in these matters. From this, my judgment 

 is that nesophilus in this instance stands in apposition and is to be 

 written as a masculine noun. — R.W.S.

3 The Jamaican Euphonia (E. Jamaica) has been separated gener- 

 ically from Euphonia on the basis of its bill, which is relatively shorter 

 but less stout than that of E. chalybea. In a group which contains 

 species with bills as different in form as those of E. chalybea and E. 

 minuta, the much smaller difference between those of E. chalybea and 

 E. Jamaica hardly seems a valid basis for erecting a monotypic genus. 

 In plumage E. Jamaica resembles E. plumbea. — R.W.S.

 This is probably true, but positive proof is lacking. As four birds 

 from southeastern Guatemala "do seem intermediate" between the 

 Caribbean and Costa Rican forms, it is likely that the type came 

 from an area of intergradation. Hence, the type must be examined 

 before Phillips' arbitrary assigning of it to the Costa Rican race 

 can be evaluated. — R.W.S.
